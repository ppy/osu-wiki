You finally made it through spooky season! Here's some Loved picks to keep yourself busy with while we prepare for next month's festivities.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

In case you're new here (or been living under a rock) and you're unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to determine which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the beatmaps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) of their respective game modes. You can click on the banners below for each pick to vote on the poll for that map, and there is a description underneath each banner written by a Loved captain. There is also a [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) as well if you want to view the polls directly. The voting stage lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote!

More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

Weekly Shonen Bye-Bye? More like Monthly Loved Vote Hi-Hi! *Heh, that was a banger, the people are gonna love that one...*

*Ahem*, welcome to this month's Outstanding Oldie, a true treat especially from a veteran of the Loved section. Made back when AR9 and AR10 diffs were the only versions of a map you needed, [Weekly Shonen Bye-Bye](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/295572#osu) is a beautiful product of its era. As fairly generic and simple as this alt map is to us now, it needed to be directly stated that it was "totally playable" back then. For my fellow mid-to-late 2010 signups, I'd recommend you check this out again, the nostalgia is overwhelming.

WATCH OUT! For this month's *Small Spectacles* pick we have [feel my conscious](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/505124#osu/2292063).

This alt-tech marathon showcases some amazing and eclectic mapping of Camellia's track, and features the familiar buttery-smooth flow you see in most of fan favorite mapper [pocket-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6808091)'s beatmaps. Sitting at over 6 minutes, 5.81★, and AR 9.4, this map is perfect for any tech-consistency players looking for a map to grind a score on!

If you enjoyed the map, remember to vote YES! for this pick on this month's loved polls!

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The *Daredevil Difficulty* for this month is [Azrealy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12235272)'s map of [Mrs. GREEN APPLE - StaRt (katagiri Remix) (Speed Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1738265#osu).

If you're a fan of [Settia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2445897)-styled jumps, just like [apoq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4349246)'s map of [Ao to Natsu (katagiri Bootleg) (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1211809#osu/2527582), you will definitely fall in love with this map, especially if you love katagiri remixes. [Azrealy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12235272) does an amazing job of replicating that style here. This map is a mostly consistent **8.72★** difficulty with no massive spikes, leaving you barely any time to breathe. Enjoy the aim and the music — it will make for an extremely fun experience.

I would love to see some of the best aim players go for amazing scores on this. If you do too and potentially want this to have a leaderboard and enter Project Loved, vote now!

For this month's *Ranked Rejects*, we are going to Russia, and we're going hardcore mode.

[Malo Tebya](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1453937#osu), mapped by [SerniGrief](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19626052), has quite the variety of difficulties for all skill levels. We don't have 100 difficulties this time, but 13 of them should suffice! While the lower difficulties are your average low-difficulty business, the higher difficulties focus on fast sliders and quick, snappy, but comfortable jumps. Besides, there's no excuse to skip this one, we are talking about a banger here.

Hey Guys. Lil Batyball here. I just went band 4 band with [chiv]( https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656) on storyboard gimmick maps these past months.

chiv: W Crashout Bro.

This month I nominated [Bad Apple!!]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1936770#osu/4003309) for this month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick. Although this map may not be a simulation through a Desmos graphing calculator, [Pisapou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16640021) has cooked up an interactive monochrome storyboard experience that features custom charting from 14 different rhythm games. You really have to check it out for yourselves. Vote YES!! NOW!

*description written by [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133)*

After playing through this entire mapset for this month's Meme Monstrosities, anyone would be bound to start saying:

Bocchi is literally me. No other character can come close to relating to me like her. There is no way you can convince me that I'm not Bocchi. Bocchi could not possibly be any more me. It's me, and nobody can convince me otherwise. If anyone approached me about this not possibly being me, I immediately shut them down with overwhelming evidence that Bocchi was me. Bocchi is absolutely me; it is indisputable. Why anyone would try to argue that Bocchi is not me is beyond me. If you held two pictures of me and Bocchi side by side, you'd see no difference. I can safely look at Bocchi every day and say, "Yup, she's me." I can practically see Bocchi whenever I look at myself in the mirror. I go outside, and people stop me from commenting on how similar I look and act as Bocchi is. I chuckle softly as I'm assured every day Bocchi is me in every way. I can smile each time I get out of bed each morning, knowing that I've found my identity with Bocchi and I know my place in this world. It's amusing how similar she is to me; it's almost like identical twins. When I first saw Bocchi, I had an existential crisis. What if Bocchi was the real me and I was the fictional being? What if she actually became aware of my existence? Did she have the ability to become self-aware?

With a staggering 50 difficulties to choose from, there's bound to be at least one Bocchi map for you to enjoy. Vote yes to never feel lonely again!

Everybody knows it's time for this month's first *Wildcard* pick.

From watching your screen on OWC's ring, to grabbing your tablet pen and fighting for the #1 king, [Meramirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009) and [deliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923) timelessly push the boundaries of mapping creativity with their [OWC'23](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023) custom map [dl++\[Delatetei\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091742#osu/4384562). [Coalatar Of The Deepers](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2091742#osu) finally finds some more recognition in the mapping scene as dl++ pushes your finger and snap aim control to the limits. Nonstop tapping bursts alongside 8\* alt patterns in this track puts you into the thick of osu!'s most difficult concepts.

Remember to vote YES! This is how the story's supposed to go...

[knowledgeking](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8022517)'s first appearance in the Loved project is none other than his [mrekk Grandmaster Cup Grand Finals NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1813319) [Icyxis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2078621#osu/4352514). Hailing at a staggering 9.15★, it's fitting for a true ending as 222 BPM follow-point nonstop streams are the focal point of this calamity. Icyxis calls for the best of the best's tapping consistency and raw flow capabilities to be pushed to the brim, as this map's daredevil difficulty only can be challenged by the very top.

Here's a reminder to go and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoLYw3ZUuY4&t=225s) and have your mind blown by [your favourite tournament magician](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) (and here's a reminder to vote YES on this map)!

[yoho - Ocean's Sahara](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1436966#taiko), mapped by [syaron105](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8741695), the former osu!taiko #1, is a rhythmic challenge map, as shown by the SR. This is a very difficult map with frequent BPM changes, accelerating up to 307 BPM, and a series of mini-streams! The frequent flow of doublets at the end of the map and the mix of 1/4 and 1/6 placements is very rhythmic and should make this a map worth playing!

Let's vote for this map!

This is a song about scallops. Llopscas too... wait, what? In all seriousness though, this is the kind of map that appears from time to time and makes the Loved section more alive than ever. Taiko players (and osu players in general) just can't resist the novelty appeal of these kinds of maps, all of them always having an overwhelming presence in multiplayer lobbies, and tournament warmups too (when they were more common). The mapset even provides an Oni difficulty, so you don't actually have to sacrifice your fingers (yet)!

The energy that [wahorruu - Ho Ta Te](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1231602#taiko/2560265) by [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349) and [X a v y](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3738344) transmits is honestly quite dangerous, so try at your discretion. The map. Not scallops. Well, you can try scallops too, if you want. Have fun!

Made as a gimmick pick for TWC 2024 Quarter Finals, [METAROOM - WORM RAVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1968269#taiko/4082434) is a truly standout gimmick map — those who watched or especially played in this last TWC will know exactly why!

During its brisk 100 second runtime, [WORM RAVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1968269#taiko/4082434) uses sliderheads to distinguish which colour to hit (as well as using them to distract you from which colour you're supposed to hit!) barline gimmicks and a small memorisation section at the end. All of these are mixed in with wavy SV that reach high highs and low lows. [WORM RAVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1968269#taiko/4082434) also uses a variety of common and uncommon 1/6 and 1/8 in all this visual chaos to further mix up players.

Overall, [WORM RAVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1968269#taiko/4082434) is a striking and truly difficult gimmick map that will require learning and one that you cannot lose your focus on.

This pick is a unique map.

This map is a throwback to the [CWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024) GF mappool, mainly when the Allstars played this map in the Allstar Showmatch, experiencing a high-quality tech map. If you've seen how [GiGas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7300747) likes to make unique gimmicks for each map, this one is no different. GiGas prioritizes 1/8's in this map with a mix of antiflow and flow throughout, but he does it in a way that follows the song exceptionally well, making you think there was no better way to map such a section.

It is exceptionally well done by GiGas and a high-quality map, and a map that we believe players could appreciate and enjoy.

Returning to the Loved scene is [coolkid](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620002), also known as fuhie to most of the community. [m1dy - Gasyadocro](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1430033#fruits) is another hyperwalk style map. However, it utilizes different movement techniques that require you to sometimes dash instead of walk, thereby testing the user's ability to control their mechanics and making this a great challenge map. It also features more unconventional patterning compared to other hyperwalk maps, mimicking an aspiring map somewhat. Enjoy, and take a look for yourself!

"Here's the octopus" — [AutoLs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155988)'s second potential entrance into the Loved section.

This map has slithered in and out of my mind for a great Loved pick. Since the map's release, I have seen this picked in multiplayer lobbies of the top 100 ranking of players and even the top 500 ranking of players. It's enjoyable but not completely suffocating the player. Composed of mostly a blend of anti-flow snaps and flow snaps throughout both maps, I figured this was a good time to ask the community if they wanted this Loved, especially with two difficulties mapped differently: an old and a new version released by AutoLs.

*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

We've been waiting for it.

Modcharting has a lot of history, most of it being in NotITG. The art has even been popularized in huge events such as [AGDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBP8MxQhEVM), and it was very cathartic seeing the reactions of the mainstream audience marvel at the prowesses that modcharters have been coming up with over the years.

On the osu! side of things, [Tunnelblick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7737096) executed that spirit brilliantly using storyboarding. Along with their own Storybrew extension [*notosu!*](https://notosu.sh/), they came up with a couple of neat little entries themselves. One of those is [MAKE IT FUNKY NOW](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2085716#mania/4611014).

Within the history of SVs, we've seen a big reduction in physicality throughout the years. So much that physical SVs haven't often been on the spotlight anymore. Usually the gimmicks and transitions hit much harder when they can breathe between notes: the more you put notes in, the less flexibility you get in applying SVs and gimmicks. *MAKE IT FUNKY NOW* features three difficulties, all of which are under 3★, so it is both pretty accessible to a good range of players difficulty-speaking, and it also leaves a lot of room to play around with silly ideas.

Go ahead! Make it Loved now! Do the thing in the thread!

[DON'T STOP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/657818#mania/1393331) is quite the chart, wherein you would have literally zero breaks, hence the title. [AutotelicBrown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4238941) has done a wonderful job in charting this song, which really captures the essence of what this map is all about.

To start things off, putting this map on 1.05x speed was difficult enough for it to be featured in the [MWC 2019 4K](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2019_4K) Finals mappool as the chordjack pick. Many chordjack maps focus on how dense the entirety of the chart can be; however, this seems to be a little different. Density is certainly going to be a problem still, but throughout this map you can see lots of anchors, and minijacks that are focused particularly on one hand, while the other focuses on hitting a variety of patterns that are mixed with chordjack. This could really be brutal especially once you lose your stamina, trying to hit jumps on the same hand at 150 BPM.

In short, stamina, pattern recognition, stability, and many more are the challenges that this chart will bring you. There are quite literally no points in this map where you could take a break or two.

Well, what are you waiting for? DON'T STOP, and give this map a favorable vote!!!

[\[Crz\]Rachel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369409) is back in the Loved voting with their 6th map, and this month it's the stamina gauntlet that is [DaemonophobiA by Azgaja](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/908951#mania/1896832). This isn't the first stamina map by \[Crz\]Rachel; we've seen their stamina mapping skills in the widely popular [Ariabl'eyeS Collection](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1596213#mania/3361331).

I don't know what it is about players wanting to suffer through such long handstream maps, but this map has accumulated a dedicated following over the years, even with its 7:48 drain time. Alongside the challenge of its length, the map's difficulty is intensified by 234 BPM handstream patterns that don't let up until the midway point, where a small but welcome break awaits. This map also offers higher speeds for those insane players who want to push themselves even further, with faster rates going up to a whopping 286 BPM (which honestly shouldn't even be humanly possible—but somehow, it is).

If you're a masochist who enjoys long stamina maps, or if you're looking for a new stamina goal to achieve, any reason could be good enough to vote "yes". So be sure to vote in the poll, or else an extreme demon will get you tonight!

[Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132), who's very well-known for their stream charts (and others), makes a return this month with [Angels Crying](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/510875#mania)!

If I'm to be honest, I'm only now realizing this was uploaded 8 years ago. That's very hard to process when taking into account just how relevant it has managed to be within that time. Despite said relevancy and [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132)'s tournament contributions, this has never made an appearance in a major one. Obviously, that does nothing against the reputation of the chart because realistically speaking, this should've gone up a long time ago.

*E-Type* is a very popular artist for charting speed/streams, as you might be familiar with [Here I Go Again](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/433032#mania/2512646) and many others. With those in mind, you can expect no less from this. The constant 276 BPM streams that play throughout the entire chart also make this a stamina challenge, which makes it hard to imagine how people felt about this back in 2016. Compared to the level of players since then, some might think 1.0x is too easy. Lucky for you, this contains uprates for those looking for a greater challenge.

This chart has truly withstood the test of time. Why not vote to give this timeless chart the status it deserves?

Many have come to know [hna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12335541) for their rice charts, all varying in degree of patterns and difficulty. This time around, we're giving you one of their more unique picks, which is [POPPY (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2044114#mania/4310540)!

Made as a custom for the [MWC 4K 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K) Round of 32 Mappool, it served as a "vocal dump" pick, contrasting the other rice charts in said round. Likely due to both song choice and style of chart, it became one of the most popular charts in the tournament.

This chart manages to achieve a very clean execution of vocal representation through rather tight hand movements, specifically one-handed trills, which is most apparent in the chorus of the song. It's undoubtedly true that most people do not like the thought of one-handed trills, but it manages to play out in a way that feels much more natural, leading to a very enjoyable experience. Of course, that's not the only thing this chart has to offer, as it really is an all-around enjoyable vocal dump.

With that said, it's worth giving this a play if you haven't already. If you have, then go vote!

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767) is known for creating tricky LN charts, and [humanly](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1184226#mania) is no exception.

The thing about this chart is that it contains so many patterns that will undoubtedly make you trip up. Lots of these would include the incorporation of jacks, and LN release timing. LN jacks tend to be some of the most difficult LN patterns that players can encounter in the game, simply because they require a lot of fundamentals and consistency in order to pull off. Looking at the chart, these jacks show on every single column possible, giving the player a test on how stable their hands are on all areas.

If you think that LN jacks are the only challenge that this chart has, then you are certainly wrong. Some trills are also incorporated to test how good you can transition in between patterns. Not to mention, with every LN jack mixed into the chart, LN release elements are also included, wherein you have short and long LNs mixed altogether.

What's really scary about this chart as well is how high the OD is, clocking in at OD 8. Imagine having to face that consistency challenge, while also having to worry about accuracy? Not to mention, it being 3 minutes and 23 seconds long can really give you a decrease in energy if you aren't careful with all the things you have to look for at the same time. I guess you could say that this is an... inhuman challenge.

There are so many aspects to this chart that make it difficult, which is part of why this would be a great LN pick in the Loved category.

Do you want to challenge yourself against the best players in the world? Or do you want to see more maps like this in Project Loved? Go give this map a favorable vote!

[shuniki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4942174), where do I even begin? They already have a few maps in the Loved category, and I can definitely say that they were one of the mappers who had very popular LN charts, especially around 2018–2019.

[The World's End](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/519859#mania/1104277) has quite an interesting take in charting from [shuniki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4942174), wherein the [Kimi no Yumewa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/519859#mania/1104277) difficulty starts with some pretty challenging SVs, especially if you are unprepared. I know that LN SVs can get really tricky, but observing how the chart goes, this first part is really a test of how well you can play this chart alongside the beats of the music. After that, however, you are suddenly greeted by a physicality test, wherein this map suddenly throws you with a barrage of streams, which can get awkward if you are not careful.

From here on out, you can see a pattern. SV charted to the music, then physicality, then back to SV, then physicality. There are definitely some mix-ups here, wherein more emphasis is placed on the SV (the intro), and more emphasis is placed on physicality (around 3/5 of the song). However, one thing's for sure, and that's you really NEED to keep your focus intact the entire map.

If you think that was enough, wait till you see the [Sayonara](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/519859#mania/1104278) difficulty. The theme of SVs and physicality is sort of still there, but imagine this chart having much more LNs. There are so many sections here that can just trip you up based on whatever LN patterns this chart throws at you. Remember that physicality part at the end? Yeah, that's basically an extremely difficult LN challenge that you will have to overcome now. This mapset really has so many surprises to offer for you.

Want more surprises in Project Loved? Do you just want to see more charts like this as well? Then once again, I ask, go hit that YES button! It's not the end of the world if you do so!!

It's been a while since we've seen a 7K jack chart.\
This is [Wonki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7898495) and [aci](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9650304)'s [Sakazuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1168967#mania/2438828)!

The chordjacks and trills that come out on the fast BPMs with a strong sound are fundamentally fun. We think the simple rhythm and relaxed arrangement are enough to pique your interest. If you can't find a good map to practice chordjack, this will be a good option. If Wonki's difficulty level is easy for you, there's also a much harder aci's level, so be prepared to enjoy it.

We hope you support and enjoy this pick and make sure you vote for it!

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you*

The chart includes a lot of pattern variety that are centered on releases skillset, with the mix of coordination, density, and inverse aspects that require a lot of experience and versatility to hit them, especially with multitude of LN snapping that makes good accuracy from this map even more difficult to achieve.
