As the last keys are pressed and the winning team is crowned Champions, the curtains slowly close, marking the end of another amazing World Cup series.

Let's get straight to it.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K/img/mwc4k2024-podium.jpg)

Congratulations to the United States for securing their 2nd championship in a row! That however could not have happened without much heartbreak for China and Thailand, who both had never-before-seen team performances, shattering previous standing records and managing to secure their first-ever podium finishes with 2nd and 3rd place respectively.

Taking into consideration that this is the United States' second world cup victory in a row this year (winning the [osu!catch World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-12-osu-catch-world-cup-2024-concludes) in June), and that the osu! mode team is notoriously strong with 6 consecutive titles under their belt, it begs the question: will the community bear witness to a World Cup Championship hat-trick?

</div>

At last, we've reached the end. This was the hardest the pools would get, and it clearly shows, with a great example being [Mare Nectaris (Camellia's "Ingenii" Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253779#mania/4793983) by [0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707) (RC7). Containing over four whole minutes of pure rice, it has just about all patterns you could imagine seeing in a chart of this length. In other words, it's a rice tiebreaker.

The remaining two examples can be shown by the [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) this pool gave us (which you can listen to [further below](#grand-finals)).

[Ashrount](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/352) has been known for their tracks in other rhythm games, and this time they're bringing us an incredible track for the HB1 slot, [GALVANIZER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253764#mania/4793954) mapped by [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065)! As expected of the slot, it's fairly straightforward with 1/4 snaps, but that's not to say it's straightforward to play, as 288BPM is really pushing the limits for what's doable. Doubt it? Give it a try yourself!

To wrap up all mappools, where would we be without the Grand Finals tiebreaker? [kanemiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/367), [Kyutatsuki](https://twitter.com/Kyutatsuki) and [Aoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/183) bring us our final chart, [Fractal Vertex](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253784#mania/4793996), mapped by [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811), [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093), [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), and [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723)!

While it might be slightly easier than last year's tiebreaker, that's not to say it is without a doubt the hardest thing in the pool. In typical tiebreaker fashion, it goes through a ton of patterns, relentlessly throwing more and more at you despite how much you'd want a short break. Even if this is out of your skill range, we heavily recommend to at least give it a look and appreciate the work of the designers who toiled away to make this happen.

## Grand Finals recap

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

[**You can view the match information here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/115677433)

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2263460006&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

After **61** matches and **30** eliminated teams, we have finally reached the final match of the tournament, United States vs. China. The United States had an insane run in the tournament, only losing one point out of the entire tournament before this match, and they are currently defending their osu!mania 4K Champion title after winning last year's World Cup.

China on the other hand has had an incredible losers' bracket run after getting knocked down in the Round of 16, and winning every single match until this point. They were the lowest-seeded team (#8) we've ever seen enter the Grand Finals match out of any World Cup.

- [DJ TECHNORCH - Digital Kecak No.5 (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253780#mania/4793984) ([-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), LN4) @ [16:24](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2263460006?t=00h16m24s) - China, down 2–0, turned to LN4, a map that forces you to triumph over relentless awkward and high BPM shields, as well as demanding consistency in all skills with a release-intensive section. It looked like the United States was about to take another point, but the tides turned in a flash.
- [Billain feat. Malux - Extraction (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253769#mania/4793962) ([\[Crz\]FolAH1217](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6232458), [Alptraum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26496648), [Abraxos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5025064), HB3) @ [27:39](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2263460006?t=00h27m39s) - Looking to catch the United States off guard, China picked HB3, a technical challenge with brutal staircase sections and extreme amounts of LN. The United States responded with shocking precision, ::{ flag=US }:: [Hello_Son](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17308009)'s monstrous 991k FC with only 3x200s alongside ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610)'s solid 981k left team China stunned, shifting the match's momentum.
- [Ashrount - GALVANIZER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253764#mania/4793954) ([guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), HB1) @ [33:42](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2263460006?t=00h33m42s) - Riding their momentum, the United States opted for HB1, a brutal *7.27*\* 288 BPM hybrid map that has technical stream sections with jacks sprinkled in the mix in an attempt to break combos. Players on both sides fought hard, but none more so than ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610), who delivered a spectacular near-perfect score with only a single 200 hit.
- [sakuraburst - Glacierfall (Park Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253778#mania/4793979) ([awdse22](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8743513), SV1) @ [45:17](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2263460006?t=00h45m17s) - With the score at 6–1, the United States held match point and chose to close out in style on SV1, a memorisation-heavy map where sight-readers would are hit with vicious speed variations controlled by BPM changes. ::{ flag=US }:: [Reshiram](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7794488) took the spotlight, delivering a near-flawless performance with only one 200 hit. And soon then, the tournament was officially over.

With that match, the United States has won the world cup again, making it their first-ever back-to-back win in osu!mania 4K World Cup history. While China played incredibly this year with an insane losers' bracket run that any team would dream about, sadly they were unable to overturn USA in the last showdown. Nevertheless, it's a legendary World Cup ending if we've ever seen one.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Hello there, congrats on achieving the first-ever top 3 placement for Thailand! Did you have any strategies this year in particular that you think contributed to this achievement?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/_Kiruru.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745">_Kiruru</a></p>

I don't think we had any special strategy because the Thailand team heavily relies on our main players such as [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) and [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267), but if I have to say what made us come this far, it would have to be how much effort we put into practising to keep improving throughout the entire tournament.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Your [match against South Korea](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251727183) was completely unexpected with your team winning 7–1. What were your thoughts going through the match and coming out on top?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/_Kiruru.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745">_Kiruru</a></p>

Honestly, the result is really unexpected for us as South Korea is a team that is favoured to get top 3, and if we won we would get a guaranteed top 3 finish for the first time. So the amount of pressure we had before the match was really high, but when we played in the match, everyone was popping off, and we were able to go through the match like it was nothing. It was so much more unexpected than the result we've shown in many maps beforehand, but after we won I felt relieved and happy as it felt like all the pressure we had gone away.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

If there's one memorable moment throughout the tournament that you feel is worth sharing, what would it be and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/_Kiruru.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17699745">_Kiruru</a></p>

It was definitely the moment we won against South Korea, because when I started playing osu! in 2020, I watched MWC and saw Thailand getting crushed by South Korea and getting 4th place. So top 3 was like my dream for a long time, and I'm very happy that we finally were able to get it. It's like making history for our country, and I hope it will motivate both new and old Thailand players to come to MWC more in the future.

Lastly, I would like to thank the MWC2024 Thailand team for practising and making sure our top 3 placement goal came true, and thank you to everyone who supported and kept cheering us on.

[Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479) is a long-time community member and an all-rounder when it comes to their contributions. This year they coordinated all SV parts of the world cup mappool, in order to ensure players are both challenged and having fun while playing.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/RandomeLoL.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063">RandomeLoL</a></p>

We're glad to see the tournament coming to an end! How well do you think this year's picks have been received, both by players and by the community?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Paturages.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479">Paturages</a></p>

While SV picks have been received well, some of the risks and bets we've taken this year may have been a bit brazen. Going from the opinions I could gather and evaluate, I believe it comes down to a few key items:

- Picks are too hard and/or intimidating to learn.
- Flashy and unintuitive picks with an easier learning curve were the best received.
- Teams going against strong SV teams were discouraged to learn SVs.

Over the years, there has been a lot of progress in making gimmicks more telegraphed, polished, and accessible. Despite the different landscape, I do believe we've come back to a point where SVs are too hard for team tournament usage. We've learned a lot, but there's still room for improvement.

Tell us a bit about yourself. What does being the head SV mappooler entail? What considerations does it come with as opposed to pooling for other skillsets?

SV pooling is completely different from the rest of picks. It is nigh impossible to balance the difficulty between one and the other. Moreover, SV as a skill set requires a level of knowledge not found in other picks. Therefore, it usually ends up being an insular task confined to those with the experience to handle it.

There is so much more than meets the eye, and two categories alone do not encompass the nuances of the skill set. More importantly, each SV pick should feel unique. Each pick is heavily nuanced by the mappers, and their outputs can be wildly different. And while this makes it harder to balance, it also makes it fun and interesting!

Despite being considered a niche skill by many players, SV still gets to shine as a category in MWC. From a pooler's perspective, what are the primary reasons for the decision to include SV in the world cups?

SV has historically always been talked about in world cups, whether in good or in bad light. Regardless of how they're perceived, these picks offer unique experiences to players, mappers, and spectators alike. Players can spotlight their SV skills, mappers can showcase themselves and their work, and spectators get to see the flashiness of the picks.

Even users from other modes can appreciate the uniqueness of SVs! From a pooler's perspective, this enables all the aforementioned groups to enjoy SV picks at their own pace. Players should have fun on our pools, and SV is one of the tools available to us to enable that.

How would you describe yourself and your music?

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435">Supa7onyz</a></p>

Variety in styles, always trying new stuff, always seeking for "*interestingness*" in music, as I always wrote in my personal descriptions: "I never *create* music, I just *play* with them".

*Les Cadences Magiques* is the first time an osu! original has been placed in the SV slot upon request. What concept did you have for the track, and how did it come about?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Supa7onyz.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435">Supa7onyz</a></p>

I was rather obsessed in the concept of "rhythms" and "grooves" recently. During this period of time, I digested a lot of house, disco and dubstep-related dance music tracks. The title, *Les Cadences Magiques*, meaning "The Magical Grooves" or "The Magical Rhythms", is all what I wanted to convey to listeners and players: just vibe with the rhythms, because that's essential for dance music.

~~(Also thanks Paturages for helping me translate the title into French lol)~~

As an active rhythm game player, has your playing experience influenced your approach to composing music for them?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Supa7onyz.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435">Supa7onyz</a></p>

Playing rhythm games and listening to their music not only brought me into the world of DTM (desktop music), but also influenced my composition style until now. I still play various rhythm games now, and I still keep finding interesting new stuffs that I can use in my future compositions.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

Do you remember a specific moment or game that inspired you to start composing music for rhythm games?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Supa7onyz.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435">Supa7onyz</a></p>

I can't really tell which particular game that led me into making music, but games like Rhythm Master (节奏大师), Rayark games (Deemo & Cytus) and Dynamix are like the pioneers which shaped my initial taste of rhythm game music, or rather, a wider range of music.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

Since you're known by several names, would you mind explaining why an artist might release songs under different aliases? In your case, are there any special meanings to the pseudonyms you use?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Supa7onyz.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435">Supa7onyz</a></p>

Sometimes for hiding identity, sometimes for trying out new genre(s), but for most of the time using different aliases is just for fun. In my case, I use different aliases when trying to make music in different genres and styles, e.g. *Normal1zer* in HDM (Hardstyle/Hardcore) only, *Supa7onyz* in most non-HDM genres, or *5-let* when a massive amount of weird rhythm changes are involved.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

Do you have any artists that you often take inspiration from?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Supa7onyz.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435">Supa7onyz</a></p>

Again, I'm always trying out new stuff while making music, so any artist I listened to could be my next inspiration. As an example, I'm trying to make some super ravey, club/event banger dubstep music, so artists like Ray Volpe and Bandlez immediately became my inspirations, simply because they make such banger music. I can name tons and tons of artists in different styles of music, but I'll leave them for the viewers to guess. lol
