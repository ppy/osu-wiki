Another year passes. Happy 7th birthday to Project Loved!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Welcome to this month's Project Loved post! Unsure what we do? Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll. Alternatively you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

Speaking of the website, did you know you can directly contribute to Project Loved? It is a little known fact that the underground moles of the Project Loved team peruse user-submitted contributions through the Project Loved website! The community (that's you!) have a voice where you can shout as passionately as you can about your favorite maps. Check it out by clicking the banner below!

Before we get stuck in, we want to thank everyone for sticking with us for **7 years**!

September 2024 marks Project Loved's 7th birthday, and we couldn't have done it all without the incredible support from the community and our amazing [volunteer contributors](https://loved.sh/contributors). Please send them your love!

To mark this momentous occasion, why not celebrate by showing some extra love to your favourite creators, and if you feel someone's missing out on that shiny Loved beatmap, remember that [submissions](https://loved.sh/submit) are always open!

Lastly, we have some team updates incoming! This is what's hot off the press:

- [aceticke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8838763) (that's me!) has resigned from osu!taiko captain and metadata reviewer duties. I'll be focusing on coordination going forward!
- [Jerry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605973) has resigned as a metadata reviewer, bid him farewell and a good luck on his other ventures!

This month's *Outstanding Oldie* is nothing short of a pure banger.

[furioso melodia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/179726#osu), mapped by [Leiwa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1746675), is the main inspiration behind [Alumetorz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1145984)' [generational beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/280107#osu/633993). That's all you need to know before checking this out.

Containing a short version with AR 9 and AR 10 difficulties, as well as a full version, get ready for a mixture of 1/4s and 1/6s as you dance around the screen with engaging patterns on a ride through one of osu!'s most iconic songs of all time. If that isn't enough to convince you, just check out the map! It's infused with that 2014-style charm that few can replicate nowadays. Some of you younger folks might say it has, uh, "aura" or something like that.

Prepare your eyes and cat ears for some brutal reading patterns, 2B patterning, CRAZYYYYYY clipfarm gameplay, and a song by [Cranky](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/23) that will literally change your "Baka Kitten Life".

Make sure to put this map on in all of your host rotate lobbies. Trust me, your friends will definitely let you pick maps after you picked this one.

This month's *Daredevil Difficulties* pick comes straight from the 👿 DEMON AIM 👿 depths as -Kirigiri's created yet another beloved aim consistency map. Originally for [BubblyQT osu!Party 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1559153?n=1), [When My Devil Rises](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1794786#osu/3678730) is filled with perpetual 214 BPM jumps at 7.85★ for your favourite aim players to feast on. Make sure to give this map a couple of runs because the Aussies pretty much don't miss in making sure these jump maps always have an absolutely electric track to support it.

This is just step 1 in the aim agenda... we'll be seeing you very shortly next month... (as long as you vote YES!)

For this month's *Ranked Rejects*, we're bringing back an absolute classic with this mapset of [Camellia - Kono Hoshi de....](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/511759#osu) hosted by [Krimek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2345078).

Set to one of Camellia's oldest and greatest tracks, this mapset was submitted eight years ago, and has amassed quite a number of plays and favorites since. It's got a full spread ranging from a 3.8★ Hyper to a near-7★ top difficulty, making it accessible to a wide range of skill levels. [Famous](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/814328), [Yauxo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/898306), and [Arbane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4150829) also feature one difficulty each, offering their own take on this song. Although *Kono Hoshi de....* unfortunately never found its way into the Ranked section over the years, this set is a great tribute to this wonderful tune and its source material. Enjoy!

If you want to see this map get a home in the Loved section, make sure to vote yes!!

This month for our *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick, we're FINALLY bringing [polyriddim](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1214743#osu/2528118) into the osu! game mode.

phonon's *polyriddim* took over the rhythm gaming community with its unreal rhythm complexity and aggressive sound, and has been charted in various rhythm games, with it even having Loved sets in [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1182702) and [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1272221). Who knew [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578)'s rendition of it would be just as brutal as the rest.

Every BPM and subdivision is on the table for this map, and you'll need tons of *Intuition* to make it out with any bit of decent accuracy. I don't even know the target audience for this map anymore, so you're probably gonna have to bring out [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905) or [Kama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13380270) for this one...

Remember to vote YES for free +10% accuracy!! (it works Trust me)

If you were around in the ancient days of 2017 (it's been 7 years!), you might have heard, played, or farmed [Monstrata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2706438)'s mapset of [Cookie-Butter-Choco-Cookie](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/542081#osu/1154509). Some people thought at the time that the beatmap was quite overmapped and didn't really fit the song. Well, fear not, because this is the Properly Mapped version by [LukerMaster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2093623)! This version follows the song perfectly and flawlessly, and there's a full mapset for all skill levels! What more could you want?

This month's Chill Champions pick was brought to you by the Aqua Crew:

Minato Aqua is the greatest hololive streamer of all time.

I really miss Aqua. For the last month there hasn't been a single day where I opened YouTube and thought "when will her stream pop up on my recommended page again". Now it's only memories from clips and old streams. As an eternal Aqua Crew member, I'll keep those memories in my heart forever. :AquaHeh: :AquaHeh: :AquaHeh: She's so amazing, cute, cool hard working — how can't you like Aqua. Truly a legendary gamer idol maid. :AquaSad:

Vote for this map if you love onions!!!

September's *Wildcard* pick really is a treat for the upper-echelon of tech consistency players, as well as an iconic tournament map you may have seen your favourite players face off on!

[winber1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/270328) is known for making many challenging and well-renowned technical maps, but nothing quite stacks up to what [Codename](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1495814#osu/3066436) has to offer. Test your technical stamina through minutes of challenging rhythms, slider shapes and aim control, and just when you think it's over, do it all a second time.

With whatever stamina you have left, make sure to hit the YES button for this beatmap during voting!

Good day to all the Hidden players exclusively! September's second *Wildcard* pick is [Yamai - E? Aa, Sou.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1245259#osu/2588430) mapped by [Faito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9706291)!

Mapped for team Brazil's [OWC 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2020) tryouts and gathering quite a large playcount while in the Graveyard, *E? Aa, Sou.* is a a great example of the classic "Hidden reading" slot in tournaments. With lots of awkward aim and patterns to challenge your AR 8 reading, it makes a perfect practice map to hone your Hidden skills (or not, I won't judge you for playing nomod on a **Hidden** map).

If you'd love to see this map with a leaderboard like me, then make sure to cast your vote!

This month's final *Wildcard* pick comes from none other than [MCA](https://mca.corsace.io/2023/results) winner [ponbot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8939857) with his take on [Camellia's Kamah (Scythe)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/940325#osu).

A prequel to his [Night Raid with a Dragon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1024370#osu/2142716), *Kamah (Scythe)* sits as one of ponbot's earliest works. Bringing you a 128 BPM finger control section into a pure alt-tech 165 BPM flowcheck requires the player to have multiple levels of tech and alt fundamentals to approach this beast. Come on... it's a Camellia x ponbot map... you know it won't miss.

I wish I had a scythe emoji...... and I wish you would vote YES on this map...

Casey Lee Williams)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/840800#taiko) by HiroK is the prime example of ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it''.

Both maps were made in the same year, possess similar characteristics, and test similar skillsets, yet both of them also amassed thousands of plays and great reputation over the years. One of them already made it through voting, and it's time to say goodbye to the loneliness that map might have felt when its brother wasn't given a chance to go through the Loved process. Maybe this time really is The One, but as always, it's up to you, the player, to decide!

[Vincs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2026299) is returning to the Loved section again, this time with his map of [Invitation from Mr. C](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351863#fruits/775447) by C-Show! This classic features a ton of patterns that were rather unique for when it was made, like 1/8 tap patterns and various standstills. We hope those who got to experience this map a lot in 2015–2016 in those multiplayer lobbies enjoy this blast from the past!

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

With [Zyzyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2888013), we have another name that is already quite known in the Loved section. With 5 sets previously loved, it goes to show that their maps are of good quality and the community enjoys them.

Similar to most of the other previously loved Zyzyx maps, this map is in the 6–7★ range at 6.92★. It isn't easy by any means, but it is a very doable map for the average player. A good part of the map is streams and bursts, but the second half of the map prominently focuses on fast-paced slider patterns that require a lot of swift movement. The mapping fits the song well, and at no point in the map do you feel like it is overmapped. For most decent players this shouldn't be too much of a challenge, but some of the snaps might catch you by surprise.

Overall a nice and short map, don't you agree?

Loué soit le grand [XeoStyle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3377280), petit ange parti trop tôt 🙏

While I doubt I'd be allowed to write this entire description in French, XeoStyle was in fact one, if not *the* single most influential French osu!mania mapper across the past few years, in a variety of categories. Today, we are coming back to one of his old-school SVs: [Disconnected -Hyper-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/609453#mania/1287062).

Featured in a number of tournaments, including [SOFT4](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/4) and [4K MWC 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K), *Disconnected* is an early-game entry that is simple and effective in execution. This adds to the variety of Loved mapsets that XeoStyle already has, living alongside [Electronic Sound Lab](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/299842) as another easy SV entry.

Make sure you stay online and *not* disconnected once you cast your vote in the thread!

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992) is notorious for having a ton of his maps featured in tournaments, and [Justify My Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1742468#mania/3562095) certainly is no exception.

With the influx of physical chordjacks being the meta nowadays, it's time we bring another tournament chart into the mix. What makes [Justify My Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1742468#mania/3562095) such a challenging file would be the patterning, and also the OD. That OD value being set to 9 is certainly strict, and leaves you with very little room for error. Not to mention, most players would be able to get a ridiculously good ratio, considering that compared to every other pattern, chordjacks tend to be the most "straightforward" to hit, at least music-wise.

Right off the bat, it already greets you with chordjacks that are a mix of jumps, hands, and even quads to an extent. Those anchors can also make your wrists very unstable, which in turn could make you drop a ton of bad judgements should you not be careful. Thankfully, there is one break section (though you could really find misses or greats should you not focus), but right after that, it's back to denser chordjacks once again. However, the difference is that in some parts of the chart, you would also be greeted by occasional grace notes, which can really make you lose your focus and make you drop your accuracy.

This expression of chordjacks is certainly interesting, by giving players not only a challenge on the accuracy side with the mix of different chords, but also having an element of technicality with grace notes at the very end.

If you really think this map deserves to go to Loved (which I think it does), then go vote YES, and **JUSTIFY it FOR LOVED**!

For such an iconic song and map it's good to see that this month [rurigamerpe777](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9938020)'s (a.k.a. Sakisagee) map of [Angel of Darkness](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1077923#mania/2281315) will be going up for Loved!

This jumpstream file is so insanely popular it's surprising to see that it hasn't already been given its chance to shine. The simplicity of this map is one of the main reasons it has gained so much popularity. The map is super beginner-friendly and has that early 2010s nightcore aesthetic to bring back the nostalgia of anyone who listens to this song. The patterning is also super approachable with its line of short trills, chordjacks, and many breaks just in case you feel any strain.

This map's fate is in your hands. Will you be sure to fight to ensure it gets the Loved status it deserves or will you become the *Angel of Darkness* yourself?!

*description written by [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093)*

Before saying anything, let me make something clear.

I have *no* idea how [Biosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6357823) got this specific version of [Paradizm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1885031#mania). You quite literally cannot find this version of the song anywhere outside of this upload.

Many of you know by now that *Biosphere* makes charts primarily for [Etterna](https://etternaonline.com) under the alias [Zeta](https://etternaonline.com/users/Zeta). A little under two years ago, he uploaded a couple of his charts, and *Paradizm* ended up in [Speed of Light 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1686361?n=1)'s Group Stage mappool. Believe it or not, this tournament is actually the reason why Zeta started uploading some of his charts onto osu!, so we have this tournament to thank.

As a tournament pick though, it's extremely unconventional for something you'd normally see in a rice pool. Why? Well, there are two main factors, first being that this has long notes. Many long notes. Or at least too many for what most would imagine seeing in a rice pick. However, they do work in a way that doesn't interfere with the actual rice difficulty, so as long as you know how to release a long note, they should pose no threat. The other factor is the snaps. They are... They are something. In the majority of the heavier jack patterns, the snaps constantly change from 1/3 to 1/8 and to some snaps that aren't even available within the osu! editor.

These factors have led people who enjoy tournament charts, as well as people who don't pay attention to tournaments, to enjoy this. With the song being especially jazzy, it's hard for anyone not to enjoy this. Go give this unique, and I mean *unique*, chart a vote!

[HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600) and [FelixSpade](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2651304) already have a few maps that are Loved, and with [Excuse My Rudeness, But Could You Please RIP? (t+pazolite Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1265413#mania/3180931), they bring another entry to the table.

With how the patterns on the "Genocide" difficulty are structured, you might not really be able to tell what kind of rice chart it is, as this offers so many aspects of it. A lot of the chart really has a mix of chordjacks, streams, technicality — you can name it all. Considering that, there's definitely a challenge of being able to accurately hit each section, ensuring that you can be consistent, because if you tend to have a weakness on one pattern, then you'd definitely have a difficult time. I think that this is a great map to train for "mixed rice" files when it comes to tournaments, as it has a little bit of everything in it.

Meanwhile, for the "LN's Reaper" difficulty, there are technical and speed aspects to it, but most of the challenge targets your proficiency at jumpstreams. It's certainly not too dense, but the BPM at 260 makes up for so much. Nowadays though, tons of players can play jumpstreams at an extremely high level, which is why this file can be an entry point for mid-level jumpstreams, and honestly speaking, I wouldn't be surprised if the top scores are around the 997s–998s.

Both charts certainly have their place in the meta today, with an expression of mixed rice and jumpstreams. They also have rates up to 1.2x, and I'm sure people would enjoy trying to push the limits of what is doable for them.

Excuse my rudeness, but could you just PLEASE VOTE THIS FOR LOVED ALREADY?!

When this post goes up, [MWC 4K 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K) will likely be ongoing. With that, we also come to the realization that last year's edition, [MWC 4K 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K), happened a little over one year ago. With that information said, it's now time to put something up from 2023's edition, and a great place to start would be with [FUTURE EVE feat. Hatsune Miku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2048074#mania/4276106) charted by [Hytex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8536263) and [fvrex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11863699)!

Chances are that if you pay any attention to the Ranked section, you'll recognize both of these names. If you've played their maps, you probably know what kind of chart this is going to be. Being a custom for the Round of 16 mappool, this took up the LN coordination slot, and as expected of the slot, you'll be... coordinating. I really hope that goes without saying. Well, even if it didn't, the attention to releases you'll need on this is no joke.

The majority of the chart uses 1/4 long notes and often mixes in short 190 BPM streams, which can lead to unsuspecting players questioning why they managed to get a full combo with 97% accuracy. In a tournament environment, this is something you cannot risk, hence why you'd need heavy playtime investment in long notes to truly get a grasp of the deceivingly tricky releases that this and many other release-heavy charts contain.

I think you get it by now. Releases are hard. This chart serves as a good example of what the "easier" side of said patterns contain, and by voting, you're not only bringing a unique chart into Loved, but two people who have yet to see a nomination! I wouldn't hesitate to vote on this if I were you.

It's been a while since we had a new DJ SHARPNEL song in the osu!mania Loved section, and we happened to find [Arona](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8748664) with their popular chart of [FAKE PROMISE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1467416#mania/3013383) that we chose to promote for you rice chordstream lovers!

This chart features dense chordstreams, with 6 difficulties in total that outline a wide range of rates. It tests your stamina and your endurance to complete the map from start to finish, which definitely is going to take a big toll out of players if they don't have enough physicality and are not accustomed to focus on the density. It's the epitome of stamina hell and perseverance for those of you that like to test yourselves on how far you can take your rice skills!

If you think the chart has what it takes to have its own leaderboard scores, then make sure to show your support by casting a vote!

Simurgh is a benevolent bird in Persian mythology and literature (according to Wikipedia). And \_Stan is a benevolent hybrid mapper in osu!mania mythology. (?)

This map can be described as having both good note design and musical expression, while using LN in a balanced way, making it a standard for hybrid mapping. The LNs and complex patterns that flow naturally along the piano melody will give you the best playing experience!

We don't think this type of well-made hybrid map is common. If you want to see this and more charts like it in the Loved section, make sure to give \_Stan your support!

This time, we decided to nominate his [Midnight Trickster](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1433781#mania/3010130) mapset. While the CuteJun difficulty is mapped in the original speed of the song, the StreamJun difficulty is at 1.1x speed, which is also featured in the [TakJun Dan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1474973#mania/3026923) (which is approximately equal to the jinjin 9.5 dan).

This map mostly features streams. It may not be very dense, but its BPM with the current density will be a challenge for many players. Think you're up to the challenge?

For our extra slot, we have decided to give another anti-meta map a shot in Loved. 10K is a key mode that has gained popularity in the last few years, even having its own dedicated active community, which drives us to finally pick this map!

We took our time to consult with the 10K community, and after some discussion, the most preferred pick was this this huge 10K pack by [awemanrank100](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1331811#mania/2759264)!

This pack features a grand total of 25 difficulties, ranging from hard to expert, that will slowly guide the players and show them the ropes of playing 10K, which can be daunting and difficult if you are not familiar with pressing so many keys at once.

We are happy to say that the 10K community is the most active part of the mania anti-meta community. They continuously put their effort to popularize their key modes, and we humbly respect their passion and drive to keep doing that consistently for such a long time. If you feel the same and want to support them, please cast your votes for this map pack!
