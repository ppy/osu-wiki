The osu! World Cup is back for its 15th edition, but now with a slight twist on our beloved country-based circle clicking festival. Read on to find out why!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024/img/owc2024-banner.jpg)

Hot on the heels of our very own [osu!mania 4K World Cup Finals week](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-09-25-osumania-4k-world-cup-2024-finals-recap) comes OWC 2024, with changes to the rank range and pick/ban phase procedures.

For this year's edition, the tournament structure remains largely the same, from the seeding, to the bracket format and even mappool. We do, however, have two major changes, the first of which has to do with the rank range. For the 2024 osu! World Cup, we have raised the minimum rank required to sign up to **#10,000 in the osu! global ranking**.

We believe that the average skill on this new rank range has risen considerably over the last few years, and we're excited to see the new team building possibilities this brings, especially for players focusing on more niche skill sets. **There are no plans to apply this new rank range to other modes currently.**

The second change has all to do with how our mappools are structured, and how the pick and ban system interacts with it. We've opted to lift the restrictions on double banning beatmaps from the Hidden, Hard Rock, Double Time, and Free Mod pool slots. In the words of our ever reliable mappooler and `#mappool-feedback` PR specialist [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656):

> The current restriction on banning two maps of the same category is not compatible with modern mappools, which often feature considerable fluctuations in skill set distribution across the different slots.

In short: **slot pooling is no more.**

## How do I register?

**[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/47)**

Please note that teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded. **The deadline for registering is October 10, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to submit yours before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu! global ranking is #10,000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

***Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, send an email to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).***

This last point is so important, we've made sure to both ***bold AND italicise it***. No exceptions will be made for late registrations, so make sure to press that shiny pink button as soon as it's available (i.e. RIGHT NOW)!
