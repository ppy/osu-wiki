You already know you're the world's #1 mapper, but this contest can make everyone else realise it too.

The [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is a contest that runs monthly... most of the time. Our judges *may* have procrastinated a bit, but after hundreds of Discord highlights, the results are finally in!

This month is all about **osu!** and **osu!mania**. Skip to whichever section you're interested in:

## Previous contest results

### osu! results

This contest's **24** submissions were narrowed down to the **top 8** by our [screening crew](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening). Those 8 maps were thoroughly evaluated by a team of judges, and unexpectedly, a mapper without any Ranked maps came out on top!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Since this contest happens "monthly", we like to keep mappers on their toes. 

For example, some limitations in previous contests were "no sliders", "circle size must be 0", and "star rating must be below 4.0".

If you're confused about how these work, feel free to ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (for osu!) or [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063) (for osu!mania).

#### osu!

Maps nowadays have an absurd amount of slider velocity changes. Back in the early years of osu! however, the editor only allowed three slider velocity multipliers:

- **0.50x**
- **1.00x**
- **2.00x**

For this contest, **you can only use these 3 slider velocity multipliers!** Base slider velocity is the best strategic tool you have for this contest, so choose it wisely.

If you're somehow *still* confused, here's [an example map that follows this limitation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/638698)!

#### osu!mania

Many mappers aim to create well-balanced maps, but none aim to be as quite balanced as this contest's limitation requires:

**Each column must have the same number of objects.**

We don't expect you to manually count this of course. [Use this to automatically count notes per column.](https://mappersguild.com/contests/mbc)

### Songs

We've received some feedback that allowing *any song* for this contest can make comparing maps a bit difficult. As an experiment, we'll be narrowing the songs list a bit this time around.

For this contest, we're highlighting 5 songs with no shortage of bed spring squeaks: **Future Bass**.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!
