Winter's here, and so is the season of smashing keys. Warm up your fingers and join the holiday rhythm!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K/img/mwc7k2025-banner.jpg)

For this year, all mappools will be made up of custom-tailored maps! We hope you enjoy playing our tailor-made, keysmashing-oriented creations. That's not everything though, as we are adding a new mod bracket called Extreme (**EX** for short). EX will be composed of 3 maps (one from Rice, Long Note, and Hybrid) that, as the name suggests, are a lot harder than the rest of the mappool. As such, they will only appear on Finals and Grand Finals.

Now, moving on to the bracket format, we are going to monitor the amount of signups before deciding if Qualifiers will seed into a traditional Round of 32 bracket, or last year's Round of 24, so make sure to tell all your friends to press the shiny pink button to register [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/48)!

For a refresher of what a Round of 24 bracket would look like, look no further:

As you can see, seeds 1 through 8 get a one-week break before playing in the Round of 16. Please refer to last year's [Challonge bracket](https://challonge.com/MWC7K_2024) for the full picture.

## How do I register?

**[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/48)**

Please note that teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded. **The deadline for registering is December 26, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to submit yours before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu!mania 7K global ranking is #5,000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, email [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).*
