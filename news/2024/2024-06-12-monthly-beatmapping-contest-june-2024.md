If you've stared at digital drums or fruits for longer than the average person, you're a perfect fit for this mapping contest. Set your sights on making a top-tier osu!taiko or osu!catch map, then maybe one day you can join the fabled *Elite Mappers*!

Never heard of the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*)? To the surprise of many, it's a beatmapping contest that runs each month.

This month, we're focusing on **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch**. If you're an osu! or osu!mania mapper, please proceed to the marked exits.

This article is LONG, so we've split it up into a few sections:

- Results for [March's MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-03-23-monthly-beatmapping-contest-march-2024)
  - [osu!taiko results](#osu!taiko-results)
  - [osu!catch results](#osu!catch-results)
- [**Criteria for this month's MBC**](#game-modes)

5 years ago, [Xinnoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057) was the last osu!catch mapper to earn the *Elite Mapper* title.

Today, that streak of silence is broken.

[Unlucky_w](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4820793) accomplished an incredible feat: **placing 1st in *three contests* in a row!** welcome osu!catch's newest *Elite Mapper*!

And thanks to [Morusya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13681464), [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466), [fayew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12498861), and [Mniam](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6050530) for judging these maps!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation/theme

A *monthly* mapping contest would be pretty boring if we didn't do anything special. That's why we have *limitations* and *themes*.

These are essentially mapping prompts that limit your mapping options (and *hopefully* boost creativity in exchange!)

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [Kimitakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4741164) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

No more slider velocity gimmicks. You've had enough of those.

This month's osu!taiko theme is more song-focused: **you must map a song with a swing beat.**

A "swing beat" is basically any song that feels like this:

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/swing.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

Your song should primarily be this type of rhythm. If only one small section uses this rhythm, a different song may be better. If only one small section does *not* use this rhythm, that's okay!

If you're unsure if a song fits the theme, [ask Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976), since he chose this theme! And of course, keep in mind that all [songs for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest](#songs) must be part of [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists)!

#### osu!catch

**Two limitations** have made their way to osu!catch this month:

1. **Circle size must be 2 or lower.**
2. **Your song must be 100 BPM or lower.**

As a starting point, feel free to check through [this list](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks?bpm[lte]=100)! The song should be *primarily* 100 BPM or lower, so 10 seconds of 90 BPM + 3 minutes of 174 BPM won't cut it.

And again, if you're unsure if your song fits this restriction, [spam Kimitakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4741164)! 

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

As part of the [limitations/themes](#limitation/theme) mentioned above, each mode has its own additional song requirements:

- [**osu!taiko:**](#osu!taiko) song must primarily have a swing beat
- [**osu!catch:**](#osu!catch) song must be 100 BPM or lower

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation/theme](#limitation/theme):**
  - **osu!taiko:** you must map a song with a swing beat
  - **osu!catch:** circle size must be 2 or lower *and* your song must be 100 BPM or lower
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).** For both modes, keep [the limitation/theme](#limitation/theme) in mind!
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
