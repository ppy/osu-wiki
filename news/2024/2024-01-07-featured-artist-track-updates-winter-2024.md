Renowned producer [**Aiobahn**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/166) and experienced vocalist **KOTOKO** joined forces to create **2** songs for a visual novel, and as you could easily guess, osu! players ate them up. That's why they're now part of **Aiobahn**'s Featured Artist listing!

That's all for now, but 2024 is already looking like a solid year for Featured Artists. You can expect:

- A new artist announcement next Saturday
- Another artist announcement the Saturday after that
- Yet another artist announcement 3 weeks from today
- Something else on the following Saturday (...probably a Featured Artist announcement)

We'll keep the rest of our schedule a secret, but smart readers might be able to deduce what comes next.

Stay tuned.
