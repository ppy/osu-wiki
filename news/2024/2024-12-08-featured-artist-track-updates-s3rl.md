**S3RL** was osu!'s *9th* Featured Artist. Our library has over 450 artists at this point, so it was only a matter of time before we picked up more of **S3RL**'s music.

**14** tracks have been added to [**S3RL**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/9). You'll find them with this slick **NEW** tag:

This batch of songs includes tracks that are already considered classics by the osu! community, like [Little Kandi Raver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/28145) mapped by [ztrot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347) over a decade ago, [Well, That Was Awkward](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/660109) which pp farmers have retried 3 million times, a map that needs no introduction: [T-T-Techno](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/83560), and *much* more.

If you like how this is sounding, you'll be extra happy to know that this week's [Daily Challenge](/wiki/Gameplay/Daily_challenge) is exclusively **S3RL**'s music.
