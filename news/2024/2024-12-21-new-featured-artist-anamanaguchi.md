**Anamanaguchi** rounds out the year as our final Featured Artist of 2024!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/454/header.jpg)

For two decades and counting, **Anamanaguchi** has been the powerhouse behind combined chiptune/bitpop and traditional pop/rock music. From their own original releases to the soundtrack for multiple adaptations of *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World*, **Anamanaguchi** has made an unforgettable name for themselves in all kinds of aural circles (...the most important of those being osu!, of course).

Through old-school mapper [Sushi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43108), **Anamanaguchi** made their first circle-paired appearance via [Helix Nebula](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10517) in 2009. What followed was an onslaught of maps year after year, highlighting the band's massive discography with beatmaps like [Blackout City](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/67226) from *Dawn Metropolis*, [SPF 420](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/109024) from *Endless Fantasy*, and most recently [Miku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1839623), which reached the Ranked category only last year.

Enough words. There are **9** tracks on [**Anamanaguchi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/454), each of whose greatness speaks for itself.

For those who prefer completed maps over templates, take a glance at what's already here on osu!:

While the year may be done, osu!'s Featured Artists will continue pushing through next year!

In 2024, **58** talented musicians joined our incomprehensibly large [Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) with a collective **476** individual songs (and that count would be *over 500* if we included updates to our older artists like [cygnus](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-09-01-featured-artist-track-updates-cygnus) or [Imy](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-10-28-featured-artist-track-updates-imy) or [S3RL](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-12-08-featured-artist-track-updates-s3rl)!)

You might've also noticed that this year continued our efforts towards original song production through [our annual World Cups](/wiki/Tournaments#official-world-cups)' increasing collection of [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals). The prowess behind every aspect of these, from song production to mapping to storyboards to stream showcases, has only proven how dedicated the osu! community is towards the creative aspect of the game.

Throughout the next year, our Featured-Artist-shaped ball will continue rolling. Expect our weekly artist releases to go on with a focus on both old and new faces alike, along with a bundle of breathtaking osu! originals in the 2025 series of World Cups!

As always, stay tuned.
