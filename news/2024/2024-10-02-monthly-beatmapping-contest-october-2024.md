If you had any doubts, the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is exactly what it sounds like: a mapping contest that runs every month.

Each month focuses on different game modes. The current ones are **osu!** and **osu!mania**:

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Since this contest runs every month, we introduce extra rules (which we call "limitations") to keep things interesting.

This time, both osu! and osu!mania limitations are the same: **find one other mapper and make a map together!**

...with a few more restrictions to ensure this runs smoothly:

- **Both mappers should contribute equally to the map.**
- **The [drain time](/wiki/Beatmap/Drain_time) must be at least of 2 minutes, not accounting for break times.**
- **Include each mapper's username in the beatmap's tags.**

Unlike most limitations, this one lets you make pretty much any kind of map you'd like. Enjoy the freedom while it lasts!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

As per the limitation above, your song should allow for at least 2 minutes of mapping.

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation): find one other mapper and make a map together.**
  - Both mappers should contribute equally to the map.
  - The [drain time](/wiki/Beatmap/Drain_time) must be at least of 2 minutes, not accounting for break times.
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **osu!mania submissions must be 4K or 7K.**

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
