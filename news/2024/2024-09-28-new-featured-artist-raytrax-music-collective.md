The only thing better than a new Featured Artist is a handful of songs from a bunch of artists.

**Raytrax Music Collective** is a group of musicians creating their own spin on Japanese-style EDM (a.k.a. the kind of thing you'll find any arcade rhythm game).

Featuring names like *ReeK* (as *Asatsumei*), *Cysco*, *somanylynx*, *Nstryder*, and the label's creator *Dazuko*, this circle has been the home for an ever-growing library of musical mastery with talent across the EDM scene.

**6** tracks are up for grabs from [**Raytrax Music Collective**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/439), all pre-timed as per usual.

In case you need a taste of what they have to offer, sample *Nstryder*'s [A Miserable Pile Of Secrets](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1876986) in the video below, and check out the rest of the previews:
