After years of South Korean domination, this year we finally crown a new osu!catch World Cup champion!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024/img/cwc2024-banner.jpg)

The United States, persevering after many podium finishes, manage for the first time in their history to win the osu!catch World Cup. They were the favourites coming into this tournament, and tore through their bracket to reach the Grand Finals with only a single map lost, and in the end, no one could stop them. They're only the fourth unique country to win this tournament, after Chile, South Korea, and China, so it was a big day for our game mode.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024/img/cwc2024-podium.jpg)

Congratulations to the United States for their historic first osu!catch World Cup victory, and congratulations to Argentina and Poland on their podium finishes.

The United States have been the "challengers" for years at this point, but were never the favourites to win it all against China and South Korea. They were, however, always a top 6 contender and more often even 2nd and 3rd. With a lot of their core members remaining the same over the years, it is truly a special moment for them to finally become champions, after so many closes finishes.

We also have an (almost) entirely new podium this year, with Poland making their first appearance up there, along with Argentina which hasn't made top 3 since 2013. Both of these teams have had their best run ever this tournament, and thanks to their hard work and dedication, they finally reached a new peak.

## Grand Finals recap

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina

</div>

This match was a repeat of the winners' bracket final, but it was different. In the Finals week, the United States won very convincingly 7–1 against Argentina, however, coming into this, Argentina was determined to make things different. The current roster for Argentina is known to be especially good on difficult mappools, and has the highest potential to match the United States' scaling. Every round, they got stronger, and it definitely did happen again in the Grand Finals.

They went on to win 7–4 against Poland to reach the Grand Finals, and they already accomplished something they dreamed of — make top 2 in CWC. However, the United States team was not ready to accept anything other than the first place. Words cannot fathom the amount of effort, sweat and teams that both Argentina and United States put in, both pursuing a chance to be the first non-Asian team to snag 1st place in 10 years. Ultimately, it was the United Stated that prevailed with a final score of 7–4, putting a footnote in osu!catch history books as the roster that got their first-ever osu!catch world cup victory, and securing themselves the coveted champion titles.

[Secre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637), [Lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149) and [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006) competed for the winning team of the osu!catch World Cup 2024, the United States.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

Secre, you took over as captain for the USA in 2019 (with the exception of 2020 with [rostld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4365562) leading). Since then your team has amassed an impressive run of 3 straight podium performances ('21–'24) leading up to your win this year. Considering this experience, what traits do you think any successful captain must have?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Secre.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637">Secre</a></p>

I think the most important traits for any successful captain to have is being able to be both a rock for the team and being able to have full trust in your teamates' abilities. Being able to play almost anything goes a long way in building your team's trust.

On the other hand, being able to recognize when your teamates are performing well and letting them take over the reigns will elevate your team even further. Reinforcing your belief in your teammates is the most important thing you can do as a captain, as it makes everyone feel better about themselves regardless of their performance.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

Did your past losses affect your mindset and performance in the CWC this year? Was there a mindset shift that was a contributing factor to your victory?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dahcreeper.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006">Dahcreeper</a></p>

Last year I would say the team wasn't as locked in as we needed to be. Half the team didn't put their heart into practice and our picks going into bracket reset were an absolute mess. Losing that match made everyone lock in way more this year and put their all into practice which I think would be the biggest factor in us winning this year.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

What were the main focus points for the team this year?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Secre.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637">Secre</a></p>

Our only focus this year was winning. Anything apart from a victory probably would have been considered a failure for the team. After getting 2nd 3 times, it starts to become less about the podium and more about the victory. We knew that if we all kept in peak performance and played at our best we could win it this year, and it worked out in the end.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

Did the team have any special celebration after bringing home the osu!catch champion title for the first time ever? Did you as individual members celebrate in any way?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dahcreeper.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006">Dahcreeper</a></p>

We went to the main chat in the USA server that had a massive watch party and talked about the victory for a little bit and got some nice congratulations from everyone. Shortly after that I went out with one of my friends to get a victory dinner and wound up just talking about the match for a bit over some sushi, it was a good time!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

What does the future hold for the US CWC roster?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Lexii.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149">Lexii</a></p>

I'm not exactly sure what the future holds cause I've been playing cwc for a while and all I can say is that I'm burnt out! Hopefully we have other players that can fill in significant roles for the team so that there's more slots to fill. I'm not personally sure if I'll play next year but we'll see!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Secre.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637">Secre</a></p>

For the future of the USA CWC roster, it's pretty uncertain right now. I think I can say without a doubt that we will not be running back the same 6 man roster that we did this year. I think [Colin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5502521), [Trent](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3438241), and [rostld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4365562) are all going to be taking a step back from world cups.

As for myself, [dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006), and [lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149), there's the potential we will keep playing together as long as the others do. It's been a long time for all of us though, and we are really looking for new players to take the reigns. Consider this part of my plea for new USA players to step up to the task!

[wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466) and [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891) assisted in various tasks as "advisors" for the osu!catch World Cup 2024.

---

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

What has the "advisor" role entailed for you in the osu!catch World Cup?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/wwwww.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-bn" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466">wwwww</a></p>

An advisor role is one that manages the mappool for a world cup and all of its components. This includes the following:

- Requesting what artists we would like to featured music from
- Working with mappool selectors to create the mappool
- Designing the systems (spreadsheets and signups) that mappers will be using
- Modding the maps that mappers create
- Creating maps where they are needed
- Relaying mappool information to the organizers

<div><a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Yoshi_green.jpg')"></a></div>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891">Yoshi_green</a></p>

Yep, we're pretty much the intermediary party between the organizers, mappoolers, mappers, and players.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

I heard from sakura that you planned out the artists you were wanting to request very early. What did that process and its timescale look like from your end?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Yoshi_green.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891">Yoshi_green</a></p>

The process is as follows:

- We write a list of artists based on desired genre and focus on having a wide spread of diverse songs
- mangomizer reaches out to artists over the course of several weeks
- When artists respond, we send some specifications and suggestions, and generally we are quite happy for artists to take it away from there
- A Discord thread is created where artists can send works in progress, allowing organisers and advisors to send feedback
- Production (including work by designers after the song is done) goes on for months until the due date, which is around when the song is expected to be showcased
- While the production process is underway, we start thinking of potential rounds and slots to place the map in, once we hear enough of the song

We typically aim for a relatively even spread of originals across all rounds, slightly leaning towards the mid-to-lategame rounds - this is done in an attempt to reward players for reaching so far in the tournament bracket, while also trying to maximize the amount of teams who get to play the map in the tournament.

Other advisors may have different philosophies for how and where they want to place their originals, however, and it really comes down to the songs we end up receiving.

Moving on to mapping then, I wonder about the intricacies of handling mappools and custom maps. Are there general or distinct examples of the kinds of projects that go smoothly or ones that do not, projects you involve yourself more in, or moments where you've felt you've been able take a more hands-off approach?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/wwwww.jpg')"></a>

Mapping requires the most management and can definitely be quite chaotic. Similarly to last year, we went for an entirely custom pool so there were MANY maps to be made.

Because of this high workload, the biggest issue is essentially getting finished by the deadline. It can lead to a very chaotic experience attempting to mod the maps to the best of your ability before showcase. While some maps may require less attention, its always worth checking every map in order to improve the experience as much as possible. We hope to lower the workload for next year to reduce the chaos though :')

As for a hands-off approach, for me, my biggest example of that was listening to the songs as much as I possibly could in my spare time. For [Psychology of James Berland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2187400#fruits/4624835) (Ro16 TB) I bought the album cd "Culprate Number Four" and would listen to it everyday from and to work. Even listening too it on my breaks to generate more patterning ideas.

While this might seem silly, every map that makes up the tournament has the opportunity to be special and provide players with an unforgettable experience. I feel many mappers (me included) attempt to facilitate that.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891">Yoshi_green</a></p>

Two things to add:

In addition to the high volume of custom maps, another reason why it can become so chaotic is because many mapping signups are done within a narrow timespan. When it comes to signups, mappers can either approach us with a desired slot and/or song in mind, or the mappoolers can reach out to certain mappers to assign them a slot that we think will fit their mapping style.

We opened signups several months before TWC even started - but a couple of weeks after signups started, over half of all the slots were taken already! It definitely becomes a bit of a juggling act to try and balance mapping styles and map difficulty, especially in the following weeks when the half-completed WIPs come flooding in.

We also try to encourage mappers to map songs from the Featured Artist listing, in an attempt to further promote the featured artists' works under the official osu! channels. We try to roughly aim for a 50% FA usage rate for each round of the tournament, but this year, almost 70% of all of the songs used came from the listing! We'll do our best to match that next year.

The reception of your music across all your songs makes it clear that many people resonate with their lyrics and powerful representation of emotions. What were your thoughts behind the emotions and message that you've imbued into *illloved*?

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/30">SOOOO</a></p>

I create music primarily for myself, so there is no message intended for anyone else. "illloved" was simply released as a result of negative emotions that had matured within me over many years and couldn't be fully expressed in words. However, there may have been a feeling that I couldn't bear to die holding onto these emotions alone.

My fundamentals and beliefs have not changed at all, but the commitment I put into the sounds I make has become more complex over the years.

Many people aren't fully aware of the amount of time invested from multiple people into projects like these. Would you mind sharing a brief overview of what the timeline or schedule for *illloved* looked like from your end?

The song itself took nearly two years to produce. From there, we developed the idea for the music video and commissioned several drawings from an illustrator based on that idea. In between deliveries I was mixing and mastering. This took a total of nearly six months. Finally, the music video was completed after a month and a half of production in After Effects.

I am influenced by many artists, but BUCK-TICK was the one I listened to the most during the production of "illloved".

I think I am one of those musicians whose production speed is slow. Even among such people, this time was the biggest blank ever. I am truly grateful to my fans who have been waiting for this new song for a long time. I was also happy to collaborate with Kawazu Inoue, who illustrated the music video for "Happppy song" 6 years ago, for the first time in a long time. I would also like to thank the management team of osu! for adopting "illloved" and all the people involved in it.
