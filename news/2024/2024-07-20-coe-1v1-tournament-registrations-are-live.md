It has never been a better time to showcase your osu! skills in a LAN than the annual COE 1v1 tournament!

If you are somehow not familiar with COE or its 1v1 tournament, [COE](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event) is osu!'s largest community-hosted event, organised by [Meyer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5452367) and [cavoeboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7361815) from July 30th up until August 4th. Along with the event itself, for the 3rd year in a row the largest LAN tournament of the year will be held there as well, with hundreds of live viewers at the event and even more online on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/COEvent)!

This is a unique experience both for viewers and players, and tickets for the event are still [available for purchase](https://cavoeboy.com/tickets/ticket-type) if you wish to attend (and can somehow arrange a trip in a week). Here is a small glimpse of what to expect from the atmosphere and the community:

The registrations for the tournament are live now! As per usual, the COE 1v1 LAN tournament will have 16 best players from the online qualifiers duel it out over the course of 3 days in a single elimination bracket, with all matches played on the new [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer) client.

### How do I register?

[Join the tournament's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zJ7e6cTVFh) and simply schedule a qualifier lobby, following the instructions in the `#announcements` channel. These are entirely automated and anyone is free to participate until **July 28, 23:59 UTC**, even if you're not attending COE. (Entrants without a ticket will be removed when qualifiers end).

The top 16 from qualifiers will be invited to play the bracket stage in-person at COE.

### Other activities at COE

If you still want to compete, but did not make the top 16, you might be interested in the community-hosted [YokesPai's Extravagant Accuracy Sightread Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1944735), focusing on reading and reading-related gimmicks!

COE is a very social event and the perfect time to meet with osu! friends and make new ones, whether it be at the karaoke night, sushi dinner or just around the venue. With the amount of [players, creators and contributors](https://cavoeboy.com/attendees) attending, you're sure to find many familiar faces.

Just want to chill out? There will be plenty of community panels, whether it's [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718)'s pub quiz, [Nytro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11327918)'s mapping panel, the storyboarding panel, or challenges such as [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)'s pp farming race, along with Yuki Aim, Wooting and [wooz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6888206)'s arcade booths that you can leisurely peruse.

You can find the schedule of all activities on the [website](https://cavoeboy.com/activities) or the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2024).

No matter which side of the community you are from, COE has something for everyone. It's a common ground where you can meet up with all of your osu! friends, make new friendships and share your passion for the game in its fullest. Be sure to snag yourself a ticket now and make yourself some lifelong memories.
