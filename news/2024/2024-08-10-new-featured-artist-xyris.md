Your ears have been desperately begging for one thing: **Xyris**, our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/433/header.jpg)

Drawing inspiration from the likes of *Virtual Riot*, *lapix*, *kamome sano*, and of course [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31), **Xyris** has made a name for themselves as an electronic music designer with features throughout tournaments like *Resurrection Cup* and [Global Taiko Showdown](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS)!

**7** tunes have journeyed to [**Xyris**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/433), where they'll remain as pre-timed beatmap templates until the last osu! server melts away.

While osu! players may know **Xyris** for their expanding catalogue of [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals), osu!mania players associate **Xyris** with one thing: ~~suffering~~ [this insanely difficult mapset of *Eviternity*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1961513). See how the UK's #1 osu!mania player [Usie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16162078) tackled it from [COE 2024](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2024):
