While top players have been hard at work making world cup history for the past few weeks, the developers also stayed hard at work, making osu!(lazer) even better.

### Editor changes

- **The visual appearance of highlighted osu!mania notes has been improved.** Cleans up some sub-par bounding boxes for objects, and makes selections easier to see.
- **osu!mania notes won't disappear when scrolled to anymore.** Another small annoyance that didn't make sense in the editor.
- **Some default settings for beatmaps have changed.** Namely, `Enable countdown` and `Samples match playback rate` options are disabled by default, matching osu!(stable).
- **Objects will stay selected if you control-click on empty space.** If your aim is lacking, we have you covered (in the editor).

### Gameplay changes

- **The idle time before gameplay loads has been increased when hovering controls.** Now there's more time to ponder whether the background dim percentage is just right.
- **A toggle has been added for star fountains during gameplay.** No more star fountain jump scares.

- **Your score will be saved even if you quick-restart after passing a map.** Rest in peace to all the subpar runs that were tossed into the void so far.
- **The "watch replay" button now works on first press.** No, your mouse wasn't broken after all.
- **New "Bloom" mod has been added.** They say everything's bigger in... osu!(lazer)?

- **You can now get an SS in osu!mania even if there are GREAT judgements.** It's big things like these that *do* make all the difference for players.
- **The scroll bar for adjusting osu!mania scroll speed is now more granular.** The speed can now be adjusted with single-decimal precision.
- **osu!taiko's constant scroll algorithm has been adjusted.** The speed more closely matches player expectations.

### Other changes

- **You can now install osu!(lazer) directly from osu!(stable)'s cutting edge release.** While maybe still not the biggest nudge for people to transition, we're getting there.

- **The public chats are now sorted alphabetically, and private chats are sorted based on recent messages.** Order has been... added?
- **Your rank is now accurately presented based on the mode you are playing.** Previously only the rank of your default game mode would be visible in-game.
- **Playlists can now be closed within 5 minutes after creation.** A more sane alternative than having to poke peppy.
- **Hold-for-pause during gameplay has been re-added.** This time it's a toggle, meaning that sometimes you *can* get the best of both worlds.

- **A map's maximum achievable pp can now be displayed with a skin element.** Select the `MaxPP` attribute for the `BeatmapAttributeText` skin element in the skin editor, and voilà.
- **Gameplay settings have been added to the spectator screens.** This is the same menu that appears before playing a map or while watching a replay.
- **The collection management feature has received updates.** Namely, you can now scroll through your collections, and search for them with the new search bar. Additionally, the game will automatically scroll down to a newly made collection.
