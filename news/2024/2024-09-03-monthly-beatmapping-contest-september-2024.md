You've been waiting for this day for... approximately a month. Flex your mapping muscles in this month's contest!

The [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is exactly what it sounds like: a beatmapping contest that runs every month.

We alternate modes each month. For now, we're focused on **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch**. Stick around 'til next month for osu! and osu!mania.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

The monthly beatmapping contest would be pretty boring if not for *limitations*, a.k.a. special rules that make each month's contest unique.

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [Nelly](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4741164) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

As a professional mapper, you're familiar with the ins and outs of star rating (including how easily manipulated it can be). Now's your chance to put that knowledge to use.

This month's limitation: **create an Inner Oni difficulty that's no more than 4.0 stars**.

Creativity will be your best friend here. While it's effortless to make a map under 4.0 stars, your goal is to make something difficult and interesting while staying under the star rating restriction!

#### osu!catch

We're taking the middleground out of osu!catch.

This month's limitation: **dashes are not allowed**.

For extra clarity, this means the distance between each object must be *walkable* or a *hyperdash*. If you need to press the dash button for any objects that aren't outlined in red, you're doing it wrong.

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!taiko:** you must create an Inner Oni difficulty that's no more than 4 stars
  - **osu!catch:** only walks and hyperdashes are allowed
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
