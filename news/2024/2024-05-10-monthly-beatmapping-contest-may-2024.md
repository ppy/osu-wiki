Today marks the start of a new contest, plus two new additions to osu!'s *Elite Mappers*!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/monthly-beatmapping-contest.png)

The [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is a beatmapping contest that happens every month. We reserve creativity for mapping, not titles.

This month is all about **osu!** and **osu!mania**. If you're an osu!taiko or osu!catch mapper, look out for another contest in June.

This article is split into a few sections. Skip to whatever you'd like:

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Considering this contest happens *every month*, we try to keep things interesting with **limitations**.

In short, these are extra rules that dictate how you create your map. For example, some previous limitations were "sliders only" and "star rating must be below 4".

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (for osu!) or [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063) (for osu!mania).

#### osu!

People use the term "contest mapping" to describe a mapping style that frequently wins mapping contests.

Generally speaking, it's a tech-focused style featuring flashy slidershapes and high difficulty. (Feel free to skim [the video above](#top-10) for some examples!)

This contest has **two limitations** which will essentially make "contest mapping" impossible:

1. **Circle size must be 6 or higher**
2. **Star rating must be 5 or lower**

Your map must follow both of these restrictions. Good luck.

#### osu!mania

Don't give carbohydrates a rest! This MBC's diet will consist of noodles only. So to any rice fan out there, we would suggest not being a picky eater this time around.

This month's limitation: **only long notes are allowed.**

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!:** circle size must be 6 or higher *and* star rating must be 5 or lower
  - **osu!mania:** only long notes are allowed
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
