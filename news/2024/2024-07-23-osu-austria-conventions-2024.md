Join us at the biggest anime and manga convention in Austria with over 25,000 visitors each year: **[AniNite](https://www.aninite.at/en/)**! Located near the beautiful Danube River at Austria Center in Vienna, you can find us from **August 9th to 11th** at our osu! booth, where there will be 12 PCs for you to play on and show everyone what you're made of.

During this time, we'll host a **battle royale–styled** osu! tournament. Make sure to register during the event and take home the trophy!

## YuniCon 2024

Next up, we're setting up an osu! booth at **[Yunicon 2024](https://www.yunicon.at/en/)**, situated at Mutliversum Schwechat. During all 4 days of the convention, you'll be able to meet our community, ask questions and play on 10 pre-organised computers!

On top of that, you'll also be able to witness the biggest osu! 1v1 LAN tournament with a single-elimination bracket that Austria has ever seen!

You'll be able to sign up for the tournament online. Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/dNFuHNmZF4) where you can get notified when sign-ups open, and where organisation of the Qualifiers will happen.

After you qualify for the Round of 16, **you're required to show up**. A no-show will automatically **eliminate** you from the tournament and open your spot for the next possible seed that is present at the event. Bring the peripherals you're comfortable with and prepare to bash your opponents!

The top 2 players of the tournament will ferociously duke it out on the main stage of the event, with the winner receiving handsome physical prizes and a bespoke profile badge. The top 16 players won't go home empty-handed either, as they will receive some nice goodies as well!
