Hello D I O, thanks for coming on! As we always do, let's start with an introduction. How would you introduce yourself to the people who don't know you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

Hi Utiba, thanks for having me. For those who don't know me, I am D I O, a [GMT](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team), member of [Tournament Committee](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee), OWC caster and playtester, host of [the Perennial](https://theperennial.net/), head of tournament operations for the [Roundtable](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable), and community tournament staff since 2018. I joined osu! back in 2014.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

What made you want to get into the tournament scene?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

It was a mixed bag for me, as I actually played tournaments well before I staffed in any. I have always been a competitive person from a young age, playing lots of different sports and competing with friends. That transitioned to competitive gaming as I got older and into speech and debate in high school and eventually university.

I played my first tournament in 2015; it was some 5 digit tournament that I don't even remember the name of. At one point, I also played in an iteration of SMT, which was a large monthly tournament series back in the day, co-hosted by [Halfslashed](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4598899), who some people reading might still be familiar with. From there I played tournaments off and on, mostly focusing on grinding in solo. I was unable to really focus on tournaments due to my commitment to debate in university; we would travel every 2 – 3 weeks on the weekend, which made committing to a long, multi-week tournament virtually impossible.

Fast forward to the end of university, and I was still craving the same sort of public speaking outlet as debate, but with very few competitions left and a lot of upheaval in the staff team at the time. I decided to try out commentating osu! tournaments, and instantly took to it. The first three tournaments I signed up to staff for were all very good experiences for a first timer, so I was very motivated to continue. Shout out to nik, Tuco, and deflateddolphin for those first three tournaments, as had they been poorly run or overall been a poor experience, I almost certainly would not have stuck with it.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

As a host of [the Perennial](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-28-the-perennial-concludes) tournament series, what makes it stand out to you that makes you want to continue hosting the tournament each year?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

When I first started it, the Perennial was one of two well-regarded large community 4v4 tournaments in osu! standard. At the start, I focused on a large prize pool and community hype to draw in as many people as possible. Now, several years later, my focus has shifted more to uniqueness in prizing and format while still preserving a similar level of production as previous iterations.
 
The Perennial has never been completely unique, so it instead stands out with the competitiveness of its matches, especially in late stages. In 2021, this was not so much the case, but in 2022 and 2024, we had very competitive grand finals matches between the top teams, with both those grand finals going to bracket reset. This was partially due to the format change in 2024. Watching these competitive, high-level matches in a tournament you host, on a pool you made, is always very rewarding.

With that in mind, the Perennial has become an opportunity for me to attempt to influence the tournament meta on a larger scale. I often use smaller tournaments to test run ideas I have for the Perennial before implementing them there, which was a big success this year with regional team restrictions. My hope is that these modifications keep the tournament as competitive as possible and continue to keep it at the forefront of people's minds when thinking about tournament formats.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

You have casted for some of the biggest tournaments in osu!. Did you ever foresee yourself becoming such a well-known and respected figure in the community because of this? Are there any professional casters you looked up to during this journey who helped you find your style?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

At the start, of course not. I initially started casting just for fun and because I was missing the public speaking events I had participated in for the better part of 7 years. Again, as a competitive person, I just kept pushing myself to be better and better, and the rest is history. I still am in disbelief every time I get to cast with older players I used to look up to when I first started playing, but as with anyone in osu!, they're just people, same as me, so I try to not let that show.

I have spent way more time than I would like to admit watching professional League of Legends, specifically LCS as someone from North America. A lot of the casters I take inspiration from come from that league, like Kobe and CaptainFlowers. While casting lots of smaller tournaments, including my own when starting out, you end up casting a lot of matches by yourself. With that in mind, trying to find a balance of analysis and play-by-play was a motivating factor early on for me, and that influenced a lot of my style to this day.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Do you ever think osu! tournaments could become a major esport event in the future?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

A lot of people will probably be disappointed with this answer. While there are major roadblocks to this, events like the Roundtable serve as a proof of concept, and official tournaments like [Lazer Grand Arena](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA/2024), the recent official 1v1 tournament, show that there is the ability for official tournaments to be run with only Featured Artist songs. I do not think this is something that will happen soon, nor is it particularly likely given the official stance on in-game advertisements and sponsorships, but it is possible in the far future.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

What are some key moments in your career (both as a player and staff) that have moulded your perspective on the tournament scene?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

Within six months of staffing my first tournament, I was asked by [tigereyes144](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6499811) to be an admin for his four-division 1v1 tournament, [Dynamic Spring Solos](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/876893). This was my first introduction to admin work and to mappooling, and it changed a lot of my perspective from one of self-doubt to one of self-confidence about hosting my own tournament. I got into contact with people like [LeoFLT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3668779) and [ill onion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8306102) (now Fairy Bread) who helped immensely with making sure I had a good idea of what I was doing in my first hosted tournament, and later [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9501251) for graphics and co-hosting. These early experiences gave me perspective on simple community tournaments and how challenging even just running a badged tournament can be.

From there, I started to branch out into hosting, sheeting, mappooling, and casting open rank. [In 2020, Corsace Open made a comeback](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1607468), and for the first time, I saw what a truly well-run tournament looked like. It motivated me to take on the challenge of making my own. This gave me perspective on how far the envelope could be pushed for community tournaments.

Having run the Perennial for three iterations now, having cast the osu! World Cup for three years, having cast for live events across multiple continents, I cannot say that my perspective of admiration for those pushing the envelope has changed much. Even the biggest tournaments are still community projects run strictly at a loss by people with unending passion for the game, and I have nothing but respect for those who continue to put time, money, and effort into creating fun, memorable, competitive experiences for players and viewers alike.

This community is not necessarily unique in that regard, but the scale on which this occurs in osu! is uniquely large. Players often take for granted just how many opportunities there are for accessible tournaments in this game, but it is truly incredible how vibrant the tournament community is and has been for years.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

You recently [received a contributor badge](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-11-19-community-contributors-2022-2023) for your outstanding contributions to the osu! tournament scene and the World Cups. What does this badge mean to you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

Being a community contributor was never a goal for me; it just happened along the way. To me, it is recognition of how widespread my contributions have been and how much they have helped people over the years. I have done basically everything there is to do in the tournament scene, and that experience has allowed me to create resources on a wide variety of topics for others to use and improve. Community contributor is official recognition that those guides and resources, alongside the sheer volume and quality of staff work I have done, are irreplaceable.

Hosting tournaments is great and very gratifying when they finish, but I am most proud of my impact when I see other people using my resources. Spreadsheets for everything from reffing to mappooling to statistics and qualifier results (thank you to LeoFLT for help on a lot of those), ready-made skins for tournament client use (thank you to ChillierPear for help on that), command-line programs for generating lazer bracket files from qualifier results, video tutorials on streaming and reffing: these are the things I feel have made me a contributor, and they are what I most think of when I see that badge. 

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

What motivates you to continue being as active as you are in the tournament scene?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

Love for the game. At this point, I have accomplished everything I set out to when I started staffing, and then some. There is no real reason for me to stick around except love for the game and for the tournament community, and I would not have kept at it this long if not for how much I enjoy running and staffing tournaments.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

What's the best advice you could give to someone wanting to enter the tournament staffing scene?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

Just start. Find a tournament that's in a rank range you're familiar with and either use a staff form if they have it or contact the host to see if they are looking for staff. This staffing thing isn't rocket science, there's just a bit of a learning curve while you get the hang of things. If you aren't familiar with tournaments at all, I would say play some tournaments first, then move into reffing, streaming, and/or casting. If you are a very experienced tournament player, you might be pretty good at mappooling. Regardless, the only way to start staffing is to just do it. Put yourself out there and start.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Who, in your opinion, has had the worst caster curse ever?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

There are a lot that come to mind, but one that is often overshadowed by its surroundings is [Dohland](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5220511)'s caster curse on [he rack](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2644828) during the 2018 OWC Grand Finals. he rack was holding an FC on [NO, Thank You!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/19532#osu/68624) when [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150) disconnected, and could have potentially carried the USA to a 3v4 victory if not for the caster curse. This ended up forcing a bracket reset as the match went to tiebreaker, where the UK won.

What's the most ridiculous or bizarre thing you've said while casting that still makes you laugh today?

I memorized a Chinese copypasta and said it live during Corsace Closed Grand Finals in 2021.

One final question before we go: do you still see yourself in the tournament scene in 5 years?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/D I O.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

Who knows? If I still enjoy the game and the tournament scene at that point, then maybe. I'm in my late 20's now and not sure where life is going to take me, so your guess is as good as mine.
