The longest-running annual beatmapping contest is back — now on the big stage!

![](/wiki/Contests/PDC/2024/img/banner.jpg)

The Pending Cup is originally a Chinese mapping contest, which had its first iteration in 2013 held by [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679). Through the past years, the Pending Cup has always been a means of encouraging creative mapping and finding new talent across the entire mapping community, and it will always be the core value of the contest.

Hosted by [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552), [seros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10562853) and [Elayue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6400861), This year's edition will be expanding even further with a larger scale and prize pool. We strongly encourage and welcome you to participate in this event!

## ![Songs](/wiki/shared/news/2024-08-25-pending-cup-2024/songs.jpg)

This year we have received permission to use two non-FA songs as part of our songs list. This also means we are revisiting a previous Pending Cup format of having **3** different categories of tracks: **Vocal**, **Instrumental**, and **Featured Artist**.

### Vocal track

| Song | qfeileadh feat. Resonance Moeko - Ars Nova ni Kassai o |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Artist** | [![Twitter](/wiki/shared/link/Twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/qfeileadh "Twitter") [![SoundCloud](/wiki/shared/link/SoundCloud.png)](https://soundcloud.com/user-684510694 "SoundCloud") [![YouTube](/wiki/shared/link/YouTube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@officialqfeileadh1081 "YouTube") |
| **Download** | [Beatmap template (2:47 / 185 BPM)](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/Pending%20Cup%202024%20-%20qfeileadh%20feat.%20Resonance%20Moeko%20-%20Ars%20Nova%20ni%20Kassai%20o.osz) |

</div>

Immersed in art, guided by a dream, yet confined in suffering forever... This is our first song, *Ars Nova ni Kassai o* by qfeileadh feat. Resonance Moeko. This song was ranked 7th place in [BOFXVII](https://bmsoffighters.net/bofxvii/) and has since then received considerable attention among the general rhythm game community. Yet veiled beneath its heavenly vocal and classical grandeur is a challenge posed to the contestants: the time signature is a **little** bit irregular.

### Instrumental track

| Song | ASA – Assault TAXI |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Artist** | [![Twitter](/wiki/shared/link/Twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/cupchi_n0 "Twitter") [![SoundCloud](/wiki/shared/link/SoundCloud.png)](https://soundcloud.com/bokuasa "SoundCloud") [![YouTube](/wiki/shared/link/YouTube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@user-je2mh5mh1n "YouTube") |
| **Download** | [Beatmap template (2:30 / 154 BPM)](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/Pending%20Cup%202024%20-%20ASA%20-%20Assault%20TAXI.osz) |

</div>

Hey, TAXI! Our second song *Assault TAXI* by ASA will give you a jazzy feeling, but in a drifting taxi rather than a midnight jazz pub. Again, this song was once ranked 15th place in [BOF:NT](https://www.bmsoffighters.net/bofnt/index.html) and is catered to traditional rhythm game enjoyers. It may even evoke feelings of nostalgia from a past iteration... Please show off your speed now! We are looking forward to being impressed by our prospective taxi drivers.

### Featured Artist track

| Song | Rabbit House – Seculo Seculorum |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Artist** | [![FA](/wiki/shared/link/FA.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/242 "Featured Artist listing") [![Twitter](/wiki/shared/link/Twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/ri_neb "Twitter") [![SoundCloud](/wiki/shared/link/SoundCloud.png)](https://soundcloud.com/dksslqj "SoundCloud") [![YouTube](/wiki/shared/link/YouTube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@Rabbit_House "YouTube") |
| **Download** | [Beatmap template (2:22 / 210 BPM)](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/Pending%20Cup%202024%20-%20Rabbit%20House%20-%20Seculo%20Seculorum.osz) |

Now introducing our last song: *Seculo Seculorum* by a familiar name to most mappers, Rabbit House! Wait, you said you've never heard of this name before? They're [Nakagawa-Kanon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87065) or [dksslqj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87065) on osu!, and also one of our Featured Artists. Now, imagine that you are flowing through the whirl of time, alongside this piece of renaissance hardcore, steadily yet progressing... Can you keep pace with the momentum?

### Mapping

- **Submission must use one of the provided songs.** You are only allowed to submit **ONE ENTRY** for one of the songs.
- **Collaborations are not allowed.** Submission must be a solo entry.
- **Submission must be in `.osz` format.**

- **Submission must not be publicly revealed until after the results are announced.**
- **The [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) must be respected except in cases where they cannot be applied, such as beatmap spread.** While mistakes are tolerated, submissions containing major unrankable issues may result in a deduction of points.

### Submission

- Once you are finished, [head over to the contest listing to submit your map](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/218). You are allowed to resubmit your entry anytime before the mapping phase has ended.

### Judging criteria

| Category | Details |
| :-: | :-- |
| Expertise (40%) | Expertise refers to how well the map executes itself to reflect the elements in the music. This reflects the technical skill of a mapper. However, in the Pending Cup, judging is not modding. Although we promote maps with expertise and professionalism and care about details, judges are discouraged from being nitpicky on small mistakes or minor unrankables, and will instead score in this category while considering an overarching picture of the map. |
| Creativity (40%) | Creativity refers to how reasonably outstanding the map is compared to the current mapping meta. A generic map in the current mapping meta or copy-pasting concepts from other "famous" maps is discouraged. The Pending Cup promotes creativity, so the winners of PDC should guide the mapping meta instead of following it. |
| Judge's Impression (20%) | Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry. The base Judge's Impression score is set to 10, and judges must explicitly mention why they apply any additions or deductions to that score. |

*Judges are instructed to be consistent in their judging style across each track when judging.*
