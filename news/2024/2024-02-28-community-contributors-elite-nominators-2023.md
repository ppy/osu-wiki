Let's take a moment to recognise and celebrate our top community pillars who've vitalised the Ranked section in 2023.

The [Elite Nominator](/wiki/People/Elite_Nominators) title is an acknowledgement given to [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) and [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) members who've tirelessly gone above and beyond the call towards ensuring a superb supply of spectacular beatmaps at everyone's convenience, whether it's via beatmap modding and nomination, quality assurance, or any other outstanding contributions towards the mapping and modding community.

As per usual, the following accolades have been compiled and written by the Nomination Assessment Team.

Before we proceed however, let's take a moment to appreciate the refreshed design for the Elite Nominator badge, courtesy of resident designer [Tanza3D](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10379965). There's now even a second tier for the few-numbered absolute titans who've somehow managed to continue demonstrating excellence and upgrade their title to Elite Nominator II.

Already a longstanding elite player, [fieryrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958) has been an integral part of the Beatmap Nominators for a very long time, too. In this last year, however, he quietly but efficiently amassed an even more impressive amount of nominations — with quite the scarce amount of resets to boot. Combined with his famous timing acumen and work ethic, it comes as no surprise to anyone who's looked at the statistics and Qualified feeds over 2023 that fiery has earned the title of Elite Nominator again, upgrading it to Elite Nominator II to accompany his already existing title of osu! Champion.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/FuJu.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10773882)

With standards and immense contributions to the Ranked scene, [FuJu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10773882) has again proven himself a prudent nominator in 2023. He promoted various map styles, mappers and song genres last year, with 65 nominations and only one (1) notable reset. Moreover, as an NAT member, he has evaluated nearly all the disqualifications that happened last year. He has also been actively involved in the BN mentorship program, helping potential BN candidates to improve and understand how to become a competent modder.

His hard work won't be left unnoticed, which is why his dedication has earned him the Elite title again this year, turning his title into a shiny Elite Nominator II. We hope he can maintain his motivation and keep working for the best of all the mappers and modders!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/Luscent.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688581)

Being an active and competent player for years, [Luscent](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688581) (previously known as 404 AimNotFound) joined the BNs in 2020 and has been impacting the osu! mapping scene since.

During the last year, he had 105 nominations with only 1 notable reset, showing his superb nomination quality. And it's not only about the numbers: from old to new mappers, the easiest to the most difficult maps, while keeping a range of drastic style variety, he has helped to immensely promote variety in the Ranked section while still standing up for his high standards. He is also highly acclaimed as an efficient worker, ensuring everyone can enjoy amazing mapsets as early as possible.

These feats have earned him the Elite Nominator title again for 2023, meaning a badge upgrade from 2021. We hope he can keep promoting high-quality content in the game and contribute to further improving the osu! mapping scene.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/nexusqi.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13822800)

Renowned in the osu! mapping community, [nexusqi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13822800) has made a significant impact as a Beatmap Nominator (and NAT member for 4 months) in 2023, earning widespread recognition for his exceptional contributions. Displaying a penchant for nominating first-rate maps, nexusqi has amassed an impressive count of nominations, demonstrating versatility across various mappers, styles and difficulties.

Notably, nexusqi stands out both for his preference for maps with high drain time and helping out returning mapping veterans to revive their old works, showcasing a commitment to promoting lengthy and engaging beatmaps.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/NeKroMan4ik.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11387664)

Despite having his three-year tenure at the beginning of 2024, [NeKroMan4ik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11387664) still hasn't let up and has contributed tremendously to the Ranked section in the last year. Despite a constant presence in the modding scene, his utmost prudence would not let even the tiniest mistake slip through — he had an unbelievable 0 resets among his 109 nominations in 2023, which is mind-blowing considering how labour-intensive BN work is in general. Furthermore, his nominations consist of many maps with high drain time, making his contributions even more impressive.

Such rigour and dedication has earned him his well-deserved Elite Nominator title. We hope he can keep the streak going and act for the best of the Ranked section!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/Okoratu.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405)

GMT, ex-QAT, UBKRC member, RC rewrite leader, and 7-year BN [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) hugely stepped up in 2023, delivering a massive year of sustained high activity. Oko helped rank a spread of maps covering all difficulty levels, mapping styles, experience levels and song genres, all while maintaining an impressively low DQ rate throughout. As such, we are happy to present the title of Elite Nominator to Oko — we just hope it won't get lost with all the other badges and user groups floating around!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/meiqth.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12565402)

Already a recipient of the Elite Nominator title as well as clinching *Best Modder* in the [Mapper's Choice Awards 2022](https://mca.corsace.io/2022), [meiqth](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12565402) has not slacked off one bit since then. Boasting an impressive 171 nominations across a wide variety of mappers, difficulties and songs without many notable issues, it comes as no surprise that they were among the Beatmap Nominators with the highest activity and diversity in terms of nominations.

Their continuous work in quality assurance has not gone unnoticed either, having also been part of the short-lived [Qualified Inspectors trial](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1806549). Not afraid to post mods or place vetoes on Qualified beatmaps with unrankables or quality issues, meiqth has single-handedly done QA checks on more than 60 maps over the previous year for any pesky issues that may slip into Ranked.

meiqth has gone above and beyond and truly made the osu!taiko mapping and modding scene flourish in 2023. Combined with their approachable and proactive attitude, it is without doubt that they deserve the Elite title once again as a testament to their continuous contribution!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/arcpotato.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12842392)

Joining the Beatmap Nominators in late November 2022, resident *Project Sekai* lover [arcpotato](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12842392) jumped straight into action! Flawlessly nominating 20 maps in his first month, whilst ranking two of his own and earning himself a pristine 2nd-place badge in [osu!taiko Featured Artist Cup #3](/wiki/Contests/o!tFAC/3), he has set the precedent for many more BNs to come! With 148 nominations in 2023 alone, and serving in the military for the majority of that, you can really vouch for his outstanding effort. Not only that, he sped through the year with only a few notable resets, an impressive accomplishment given his multitude of nominations no less.

arcpotato had already made his name in the mapping scene as a J-Rock enthusiast with his many mapsets and guest difficulties, and this only continued into his work as a BN where you will find many excellent sets dusted with his talent to improve each and every one. His standards of quality never falter and that makes him truly worthy of the Elite Nominator title.

But it doesn't end here! As a true attestation of his efforts, he joined the Nomination Assessment Team in December of last year. He continues to remain approachable, friendly and overall an extremely knowledgeable modder in his own right, earning him a second title to his already flashy profile.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/op45667.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21973491)

Despite only joining the Beatmap Nominators in August 2022, [op45667](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21973491), also famously known as the 2nd BN for every osu!taiko map in the game, has consistently performed at a top level throughout 2023 and has proven himself to be one of the top BNs this year, deserving of this award. Not only did he reach the daily nomination limit multiple times as well as the 90-day limit of 100 nominations, but he also made sure to nominate a very diverse catalogue of over 250 maps during his one-year tenure as a Beatmap Nominator.

With very few issues, his sudden appearance left a significant impact on the osu!taiko mapping and modding scene. Thanks to his help, many new mappers were able to rank their very first map, and many others were able to rank some really high-class maps and songs that are popular and well liked to this date.

Until his very deserved break from BN work in December 2023, he outclassed the majority of osu!taiko nominators and left many excellent impressions, which led to him earning a title befitting of his prestige.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/zerokt.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13776127)

In 2022, [zerokt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13776127) was the most active member of osu!catch. It is no surprise that in 2023 zerokt pulled this off once again, being the driving force for the game mode, nominating a stunning 88 unique beatmaps throughout the year, standing head and shoulders above the rest in numbers.

Besides this, zerokt has been doing his part in quality assurance throughout the year, ensuring that more than 150 maps are up to scratch. This made them contribute to more than 70% of all osu!catch beatmaps as either a nominator or quality checker.

In addition, they have been part of the NAT since the beginning of September 2023, showing almost no slowdown in their performance as a nominator.

All this combined shows that zerokt has contributed hugely to the game mode in 2023, earning him the title of Elite Nominator yet again, becoming the second Elite Nominator II of osu!catch.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/gzdongsheng.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8660315)

As if one time wasn't enough, [gzdongsheng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8660315) continues his strive for being the next osu!mania Elite Nominator a second time. A mind-blowing 118 nominations and zero notable resets throughout the year speak for themselves and show how significant his influence on the Ranked section has been. This exemplary performance hasn't been with anything but impeccable attention to detail for each quality check on the maps he nominated, something astute modders understand as hinting at his vast experience as a modder.

It should be noted that his expertise covers many a mapping style, song genre, and key mode, as well as maps of even the lengthiest of drain times and the highest levels of difficulty, all in which he has excelled in every possible aspect. Not only being a prime example figure of a nominator, the fact that he has done all of this while fulfilling the obligations as an NAT member, participating in various different project showcases, and involving himself heavily in the community and discussions just proves how staggering his level of prowess and dedication really is.

gzdongsheng has never been anything short of Elite Nominator material ever since he became a BN for the first time, and it is astonishing to see the sheer consistency he has had over the course of his tenure. We sincerely hope that he will keep continuing this streak for upcoming years and continuing to set the example for the rest of the BNs!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/Ilham.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3057154)

One of the most active osu!mania Beatmap Nominators last year was none other than K-Pop enthusiast [Ilham](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3057154). They have an expertise in full spreads and proved that over the last year. They managed to nominate 115 unique maps and only 21 of those maps were not a spread. This is something truly impressive. This means that they have nominated the most drain time last year of any osu!mania Beatmap Nominator!

Not only were they very active, they were also very thorough and clean with their checks. So much so, that they managed to nominate all of those sets without having a single notable DQ.

We are very excited to see more big sets from them in 2024, and probably more K-Pop too.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/Monoseul.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16010604)

It is quite rare for a newcomer in the Beatmap Nominators to be awarded the pinnacle of BN awards — besides the prestigious 2021 mug — on their first year in the user group. But lo and behold, [Monoseul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16010604) has been able to reach this milestone in almost record time! Besides the amazing work they've done nominating a plethora of different sets and spearheading the 4K high-end scene, their diligence in quality assurance across many nominated beatmaps is what made them stand out from the pack.

Their rigorousness is to be commended. Not only were they capable of being thorough in their own nominations, they pushed 83 unique sets during 2023. Not everyone is capable of withholding such high standards both in quality and quantity. If we were to add the countless hours they've poured into assessing the quality of Qualified sets and their involvement in the mapping and modding community, that number could very easily reach the hundreds!

Mono has had a long-lasting impact in 2023, both directly and indirectly. This award is a recognition of their work, and we hope they become a role model for the newer generations of Beatmap Nominators to come in 2024 — and beyond!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/AWMRone.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10351684)

Witnessing the outburst of high-level osu!mania 7K maps in 2023, [AWMRone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10351684) is one of the main strengths behind this big scene, without doubt. Despite being the first year of his BN tenure, he has already proved himself to be one of the top BNs who deserve the Elite Nominator title!

With more than half of the Ranked 7K "black icon" sets in 2023 being pushed by his hand, he really has shown his knowledge and expertise in this field that usually tends to be difficult to handle. Not only that, it's astonishing to see that he is always able to give extensive high-quality modding to such sets, covering a lot of aspects and ensuring they are in the best state. As a high-ranking player, he transferred his playing skills into modding really well and contributed a lot into the Ranked section throughout the year.

Finishing strong in 2023, AWMRone has set a prime example in the high-level osu!mania 7K scene with his outstanding performance, so let's look forward to what he can bring us in 2024!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/Furryswan.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9555243)

Delivering to you, one of our longstanding osu!mania BNs, [Furryswan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9555243) is one of the few nominators who have maintained consistent performance throughout their tenures while at the same time staying true to their passion of nominating a lot of technical and uncommon styles of 4K, featuring graces and niche patterning that are rare to see in Ranked nowadays. The breakthrough and novelty to achieve this has consistently been made for years, and it's finally time for him to be recognised for his contribution.

He has not only pushed sets that distinctly separate himself from the other BNs, but his modding quality and the amount of detail he puts into all of his mods shows his expertise in handling each map with the highest degree of quality. This doesn't happen often and can only be done through the sheer tenacity of learning and experiencing this unconventional skill for years.

It's inspiring to see him thrive, and we hope that his achievement will also be a source of inspiration for the other BNs, signalling that diligence and perseverance do pay off when working for consistency and aiming to be the best.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-28-community-contributors-elite-nominators-2023/Protastic101.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6712747)

Avid fan of 5K and keysounds, [Protastic101](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6712747) has over the last year put in a lot of work and effort and managed to nominate a total of 134 beatmaps, mostly from 5K maps as well as newer mappers creating their first Ranked map.

They also did a lot outside just the regular BN work, putting in a big effort in the mania modding hub where they have organised a lot of events for new mappers to get feedback and join the community. It cannot be understated how important that is for the mapping scene.

We will have to see what they will do in 2024, but one thing that likely won't change is their enthusiasm for 5K maps.

Many thanks to the Nomination Assessment Team as a whole for everything from helping decide the recipients, to writing out their descriptions and organising much of the process. The astute among you may notice that some recipients are themselves NAT members, but rest assured that all recognitions are team decisions by the other members.

As always, we're eternally thankful to any and all contributors who've dedicated their heartfelt efforts towards the labour of love that's alternatively known as the osu! community, and we hope to honour your (yes, *your*) accomplishments someday in the future.
