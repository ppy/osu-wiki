This has been an amazing year so far for the mania 7K community. For the **first time ever** there has been a stage above Round of 16 in the official 7K World Cup, and it is so good to see so many new teams apply, qualify, and compete in the most prestigious 7K tournament of the year.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_7K/img/podium.jpg)

Congratulations to South Korea on their 5th osu!mania 7K World Championship title! This is a good way to start off the year, and possibly the start of South Korea's domination in all 4 game modes, considering they easily rank top 4 in all of them.

Massive congratulations to the Philippines and Malaysia as well for putting up an amazing fight the entire way through, giving us many of the best matches this year, only possible with the huge amounts of skill both teams possess.

The osu! team continues to work and expand the Featured Artists programme, and as part of that a lot of music gets to be made specifically for the World Cups, which are referred to as osu! originals. This year's MWC7K boasts an amazing **7** new tracks accompanied by original artwork used as beatmap backgrounds.

## Interviews

Who would be better placed to educate us on the thoughts and attention put into the World Cup (both from an organising and playing point of view), than the players and organisers themselves! Let's hear what some of them had to say about their experience this year.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/butanic.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586)

Even though it's their first time participating, **butanic** is a Japanese legend and veteran when it comes to anything VSRG related. With such accolades to their name, they shredded through every RC pick this year, and provided an anchor for the team when they needed it the most.

[**You can find the Japanese version of the interview here.**](https://gist.github.com/0x84f/daed4ff36f81e64a5d2f68a234b1e10a)

---

*Is "butanic" a pun on "buta niku" (pork)?*

> Yes, the name came from pork.

*I know you started playing a long time ago. How did it start, and what makes you come back to the game and still play on such a high level for so long?*

> DJMAX Online was the first rhythm game I played, followed by o2jam and BMS. There was a time when I left BMS for a while, but I started playing BMS again when the Stella difficulty chart appeared, and I started playing osu!mania about a year ago when I found out that the osu!mania 7K Discord server in Japan had been created.
> 
> I have always been obsessed with getting first place, and even after getting first place, getting an even higher score, so I feel that my desire not to lose has helped me to maintain and improve my skills.

*Were there any aspirations or goals that you've set for yourself for the World Cup that you are able to look back upon?*

> It was my first time participating, and I was very nervous. Japan is strong in RC but very weak in LN, and we could not lose even a single RC pick, so we aimed to get a higher score than anyone else. I was especially practising to get a v1 SS in chordstreams and v2 99.99% in chordjacks.
> 
> I lost an RC pick for the first time against China, but overall I think I achieved a good result.

*Do you have anything you want to let the readers know?*

> I feel that the population of 7K users is very small compared to 4K users. I think this is simply because they are reluctant to start because of the complexity of the many fingers involved, but there are many patterns and fun things that can be expressed in 7K. The small number of users also means that there are more opportunities to participate in the MWC.
> 
> I started playing osu!mania when I was 30 years old, and I have improved a lot in the past year. As long as you have the feeling that rhythm games are fun, you have as many chances as you want to improve! If you are still playing only 4K, please try to play 7K as well, and let's fight in the MWC someday!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/yz1155.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008)

Born and raised on osu!mania, **yz1155** has climbed through the ranks and is now standing shoulder-to-shoulder next to some of the greatest osu!mania players ever, and having them as teammates in the most prestigious 7K tournament of the year. They have outdone themselves this year by being a core player for the South Korean team, with emphasis on their amazing performance on technical charts.

---

*I know you started playing a long time ago. How did it start, and what makes you come back to the game and still play on such a high level for so long?*

> I forgot what made me start VSRGs, but I remember why I stopped playing the game. It was because I didn't have enough time.
> 
> At first, I didn't play for 1 day, after that I didn't play for a week and then, for a month… It just happened until it had been a couple of years. But, I started playing VSRGs again after I got enough spare time. Why did I restart? Because playing games is fun! It is a simple, but important reason.
> 
> I played VSRG for so long, but I am not at such a high level of skill at all. So, I can't answer how I could play at such a high level for so long, however, I can give an answer of how I played for long! To put it simply, it was because I always enjoyed playing.
> 
> Why are we all playing games? Definitely, for enjoyment. If you don't have an interest in ranked maps or on regular Dan stages, you don't have to play it. Just enjoying is what I want to do and that is the main reason why I keep playing after such a long time.

*Were there any aspirations or goals that you've set for yourself for the World Cup that you are able to look back upon?*

> Tournaments like MWC7K, SOL, and ETT are kind of fan signing events with huge star players for me. I don't mind the result of the tournament, because I always enjoy everything. As a VSRG fan, meeting superstars in tournaments is already a huge level of enjoyment. So, my goal is to always have some fun and do my best.

*Do you have anything you want to let the readers know?*

> [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406), [cheewee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497) and [Kura](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405) are not earthlings. It's a huge secret, so don't let anyone know.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/noname.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730)

**-NoName-** has gone absolutely bonkers this year, not only answering the call of being a mappool selector, but also going above and beyond by having **2** of their own charts (both solo and mapped in collaboration) present in **every stage** of the tournament this year, excluding Qualifiers. Some say they placed 50,000 notes over the course of this year's tournament alone, but we'll let you count them out.

*What were your initial thoughts about stepping up as the head pooler for this World Cup? What made you go for it?*

> Did you know that originally, this was going to be a Round of 16 tournament? That was my original plan because I assumed that we would follow last year's format, but then [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) (4K MWC's head pooler) told me that it should be a Round of 24 since Qualifier results from 2023 showed that seeds 19-24 were somewhat competitive. That was the "Oh shoot, I'm actually in charge of this now" moment for me.

*What were your favourite charts in the pool, if there are any? Or any favourites that you worked on?*

> The most obvious one is [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881)'s chart of [rosso](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2134144), the tiebreaker for the Finals round. He spent four months working it. It is hardly recognizable now compared to what it was a few months ago. The reception to it was equally crazy as well, and it also produced [one of the best endings to a match](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2066497602?t=1h5m19s) I've ever seen.
> 
> I thought [zeno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6576888)'s [Hi Genjitsu Tohi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1885701#mania/4490678) (Finals LN2) was neat as well. It is a lot closer to traditional O2Jam patterns than people have previously seen in the tournament. The people asked for shields after 2023, and that is what they got.
> 
> [_Yiiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6066359)'s round of 24 tiebreaker, [Majestic 12](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2119554#mania/4452392), was cool as well. I think it was very well-balanced, and the chart is just fun to play. It also introduced me to this banger of a song, so thanks for that! It was interesting seeing people's reactions to various players missing on the seemingly easy breaks in the match, though. A lot of people who don't play 7K osu!mania thought people were missing on easy parts for no reason. If only they knew…

*Any messages you want to impart to the team? Or to anyone who wants to become part of any tournament's map selection team?*

> To the team: none of this would have been possible without you. This was definitely a learning experience for us, and we will be making many adjustments for future iterations.
> 
> For anyone who wants to become a part of the team, we look forward to seeing your application sometime in August or September. We especially need help from those who make LN charts, so feel free to apply at that point, and we'll see how we can fit you in if possible. I remember signing up for play testing in 2023, and it was the most fun playing this game I've ever had.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/surfchu.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895)

**SurfChu85** is another staff member who took it upon themselves to fill gaps in the team and provide unique commentary from the eyes of not only an experienced player, but also one of the people who were in charge of crafting the same mappool the players are competing on.

*For this year's edition, what match got you fired up the most while commentating?*

> There's quite a few matches that I was looking forward to casting, but the one that really became a highlight was China vs Philippines. The match-up was not only historic, but it also had a big effect on how the tournament will end. I remember being so happy getting the match just because of it.
> 
> While the match did go as expected in its first half, and was on its way to finish early, I held on to the hope that something exciting would happen. Suddenly, you had one player grab that second wind and immediately shined. Not to mention, all the players were pulling off scores that can give anyone goosebumps. And don't get me started on the tiebreaker, oh my goodness.
> 
> I was already struggling holding my composure, I think [PotassiumF](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4247722) as well. I just remember repeating "Don't do this to us!" on the background of [PotassiumF](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4247722)'s storytelling. Yeah, it was worth the heart attack.

*You're the only commentator who's also in the mappooling team. How does it feel, knowing the general reception of the maps from the team, and then commentating over the players' performance? Do you generally know what to expect?*

> I think that the main benefit for me about knowing the pools weeks in advance is that it makes it easier for me to take notes of a certain chart's tendency to be tricky, or whatever adjective you can give it.
> 
> It doesn't really say that much about how matches will go with that knowledge as is. Though, I'd say that you can immediately tell what can happen just based on the players involved going into a match. Obviously, with how teams are built, you can immediately tell "Ah, this is a noodle team.", "Oh, they're most likely going to gun for the rice picks.". Much more if there are players that are highly specialized in a specific skillset (think early game LN Coordination), then you can immediately point out that even during the mappool showcase prior to the matches.
> 
> I'd say that a lot of the surprises really happen early on in the tournament since you have the "non-traditional" teams provide performances on par with the powerhouses. Heck, we even got some powerhouses get a scare. I'd say that with any tournament really — while a match can go a certain way on-paper, don't be surprised if we get something special.

*You joined the MWC 7K staff roster during its revival back in 2022. In comparison to previous editions, and throughout these last three years, did you like the shifts and changes happening within the tourney?*

> The reason why I even got into tournaments in the first place was because of seeing and experiencing the hype of MWC 7K back in 2016. I've seen a lot of names come and go, not only from the players side, but also on the people running the show. I can't really say much about the time prior to 2022 mostly because I was an "outsider" at that point; but knowing from my staffing stints on osu!mania's biggest community tournaments at the time, I'm pretty sure that making things happen was never easy. Heck, knowing that I've had some of my own charts featured before I even joined the team was a surprise!
> 
> When I volunteered to take part as an early game playtester for MWC 7K 2022, I knew at that point that the tournament itself is practically a mission — to revive a scene that went into inactivity. The team continued to grow as a unit, and I hope the rest of us do agree that we also made a solid group of friends along the way. I also got the push to be part of the commentary team with the encouragement from all the selection team members at that point. I got to learn more about how 7K works in ways that not just simply playing random charts from time to time would teach. Not only that, but I think that valued growth was one of the biggest reasons why the 7K community is starting to thrive again. We see some big community-hosted 7K tourneys again. Lots of interest from single keymode players to touch 7K as well.
> 
> I guess to sum up my thoughts, everything that happened over the past editions of MWC7K led to what I think is the keymode's biggest growth period since I started playing osu! ten years ago. I honestly can't wait for the improvements and adjustments that will be made leading up to 2025. Being part of the process is something I feel so honoured for, and I hope to be able to be there again.

**Akiri** is first and foremost one of our own, a community member and mania player. Their debut started with this year's Semifinals tiebreaker, but their music journey goes [so far beyond that](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/401).

*How did you get into music production?*
> It was out of spite, my father told me I'd never be capable of creating a name for myself which resulted in me simply doing so to spite him.

*What was your main inspiration for "Symphony of the Lost Souls"?*
> My inspiration was from my story I'm writing, following our main character as he is currently trapped in a soul star.

*Were there any considerations that you had to keep in mind while working on MWC7K?*
> Not particularly, other than keeping stuff clean and professional I had a great time while working on everything.

*Aside from the people in the osu!mania scene you have featured on your tracks, do you have any other people you want to collaborate with?*
> I do! I'd love to work with games like Arcaea and Beat Saber as well as collab with artists like Creo and Meganeko (two large inspirations in my early career).

Thank you to all **71** contributors who helped make this year's osu!mania World Cup 7K tournament what it is, and thank you to **130** tournament participants who came out to show off their skills and have fun!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-02-29-osu-mania-7k-world-cup-2024-concludes/mwc7k2024-credits.png)

This year has shown that the interest in 7K mania is slowly growing, and we hope that trend continues. Hopefully this year brings new stars into the scene, ready to fight their way to the top, each with their own rivalries, strengths and weaknesses.

Who knows — maybe even you, the reader, might be the next 7K rising star?
