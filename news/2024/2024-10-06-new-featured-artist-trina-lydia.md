You don't need synesthesia to see why **Trina Lydia**'s music is worth mapping.

While **Trina Lydia**'s style is clearly reminiscent of authentic rhythm game tunes, they refuse to stick to a single genre.

Each track that **Trina Lydia** creates is fresh, accompanied by sprinkles of references to other iconic tracks and explorations into new production techniques. It doesn't matter how different each song genre is though — all of **Trina Lydia**'s songs are worth bringing into osu!.

[**Trina Lydia**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/440) is officially home to **8** new songs, including two [originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) produced specifically for community events!

Experience what **Trina Lydia** has to offer through a flashback to [COE 2024](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2024), where circle clicker [zts](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4675441) played [Stellar Immortality](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2197796) with an unreasonably massive tablet (using full area, of course):

Slice out part of today to start a map using a pre-timed beatmap template from [**Trina Lydia**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/440). We're not responsible if that slice becomes your whole day.

The hint about an upcoming J-rock artist from [our last Featured Artist announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-09-28-new-featured-artist-raytrax-music-collective) ended up being a lie — they've been rescheduled for later this month! In the meantime, stay tuned for another artist reveal next weekend!
