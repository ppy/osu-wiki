Tune in to see the results of last weekend's matches, get familiar with the podium finishers, and get ready for the Grand Finale spectacle!

The previous weekend was in some ways surprising, with 3 out of 4 matches appearing to be completely one-sided. That however wasn't the case as the top 3 finishers had to fight tooth and nail for every single point, with most points concluding with only a 10–20k point difference on each side.

Next to that, South Korea had been knocked out making that only the **3rd time ever** they had not reached the podium since 2014, with China taking their spot and soaring to new heights together with Thailand, both teams accomplishing their **1st ever** podium finish.

However, there can only be one champion. Will the United States be able to start a winning streak, or will one of the new podium finishers manage to go all the way and claim their first ever championship?

The pools are almost reaching their peak in difficulty, and it's becoming very apparent with how hard all the picks have become. To give an example, [Campanella](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2250145#mania/4785256) by [\[Crz\]Crysarlene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871) (LN2) seriously begins to show just how much focus is involved when it comes to map density, as you'll have to make sure your accuracy doesn't fall flat despite the straightforwardness behind the patterns.

To add onto that, [Snailchan Adventure](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2249895#mania/4784661) by [lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052) (HB2) is also a great show of difficulty, all thanks to it being what is possibly the most jack-heavy hybrid we've seen yet, which is no joke when you also factor in the amount of 1/8 bursts it contains (that's 348 BPM, by the way).

Wrapping up the pool is a nice bow tie in the form of an [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals)!

[Sydosys](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17523947). You all know him by now. Having made so many originals to the point where it becomes hard to count, he's finally making an appearance for MWC 4K 2024 with [AKRASIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2250149#mania/4785264) mapped by [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991)!

Shockingly enough, this is our second SV original we're seeing this year. Taking up the same slot as the first (SV2), it ends up going in a direction that makes it look deceivingly easy with notes snapped to 1/4 and consistent rhythm, but with quick and smooth alternating scroll speed paired with invisible notes, it's bound to mess with your brain.

## Finals results

The podium places have been claimed. Congratulations to the United States, Thailand and China!

After defeating their opponents, South Korea and China met in the losers' Finals bracket. On one side you have South Korea, one of the best performing teams in MWC 4K history, and on the other on you have China, a team looking to achieve their first top 3 finish ever. Both teams are consisted of all-rounder players, so this match fully depended on great pick and ban strategies, and making sure no break points are given out.

- [S.S.H. - Holy Orders (Be Just or Be Dead)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2250132#mania/4785237) ([Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082), RC3) @ [24:13](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2257606852?t=00h24m13s) - Both teams won their first two picks, and the score was 2–2. A fierce fight commenced between the two teams, and after a heart-pumping back and forth throughout the entire map, China scored their first break point with an impressive team score of 2,970,037.
- [Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat. Hatsune Miku - BUILD AND SCRAP](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2250136#mania/4785242) ([Hylotl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18270260), LN1) @ [31:13](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2257606852?t=00h31m13s) - China chose LN1 in hopes of expanding their newly acquired lead. After keeping a good distance at the start, 2 of their players missed and South Korea struck back with a break point of their own, with ::{ flag=KR }:: [imyeeyee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26473894)'s 988,090 FC at the helm and a new scoreline of 3–3.
- [Snail's House - Snailchan Adventure](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2249895#mania/4784661) ([lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052), HB2) @ [53:10](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2257606852?t=00h53m10s) - After another back and forth resulting in a 4–4 tie, South Korea called a time-out that resulted in HB2 being picked. After a myriad of misses from both teams and the lead flickering back and forth, it was ::{ flag=CN }:: [\[GB\]ParasolTree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27552902) that managed to secure a victory for their team, with ::{ flag=KR }:: [Naaaad](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10344857) giving them a run for their money.

This marked the end of South Korea's run in MWC 4K, with a gamble on RC5 ending up being their last hurrah, sealing their fate with a final score of 4–7.

This match was a perfect showcase of a match where the outcome was not affected by skill, but rather the strategy behind picks, bans, and player nerves. While it's time to bid South Korea farewell, China has accomplished their highest placing ever, and will get a shot to make the dream run come true in next week's Grand Finals.

## Score highlights

The end of the tournament draws ever so closer. While the Grand Finals are still a few days away, we still have a couple scores worth highlighting. With that said, let's see how players fared in the last stretch of the tournament!

- ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) surprised us all with their **absolutely bonkers** score of 996,402 in [daiki kasho - Place In This World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2236927#mania/4752380) (RC6) by [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082) in their [match against the United States](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2257605526). A commendable performance despite clashing against other rice titans.
- Another player worth highlighting is ::{ flag=KR }:: [Naaaad](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10344857), who **dominated** all the rice picks they participated in. Just to name one instance, in the aforementioned [match versus China](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2257606852), they managed to score 995,194 points in [S.S.H. - Holy Orders (Be Just or Be Dead)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2250132#mania/4785237) (RC4), also made by [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082).

We've had a blast highlighting the best of scores up until now! Nerves are sky-high and adrenaline is pumping through the players' veins. The teams last standing are well aware of the challenge ahead of them. To them, what matters most are the scores they're going to pull up next round, so lets all hope for an exciting climax!
