The mappool size has increased for this week by introducing two new slots: Chordjack 3 ([RC3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238657#mania/4757017)) and Hybrid 3 ([HB3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238644#mania/4756987)). Chordjack is straightforward in the same sense as jumpstream, but challenges a completely different skill set which players are absurdly good at, which can lead to a single 200 causing a team to lose a point they would've won otherwise. You can be sure to look forward to some extremely high scores for this pick in future rounds.

On the other hand, Hybrid 3 is the last slot for the category, with it typically being much more technical and harder than the other two, demanding more raw skill than accuracy from players.

New slots aside, the increase in difficulty is very noticeable, with good examples being [RC6](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238283#mania/4755965) and [LN1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238606#mania/4756867). [RC6](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238283#mania/4755965) came as a big surprise, due to how it has already gained notoriety in the past for containing patterns that can catch anyone off guard (such as longjacks), or bursts within 260 BPM streams. [LN1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238606#mania/4756867) is also notable for the significant step up from the Round of 32, mixing in denser streams to the already tricky releases from the previous round.

With that said and done, this round also brought us one new [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) and [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-08-25-new-featured-artist-supa7onyz)!

[Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811) brings us MWC 4K's very first SV original! The amount of people who wanted one has grown from last year, and we can finally present you with [Les Cadences Magiques](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238686#mania/4757071), brought to you by our newest Featured Artist and fellow mania player, [Supa7onyz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5378805)!

You may find yourself learning this quite fast, but the real challenge lies within how deceptively tricky it is to get good accuracy on this chart, as the amount of polyrhythms and 1/5 snaps have a large play into the main gimmick. Click the banner to give it a go for yourself!

Last week Poland pulled an insane fight against Singapore despite the seed placements, with Singapore barely snatching victory from the jaws of defeat with the match ending at 5–3. This time however, it was not looking too good for Singapore from the get-go, as they were up against one of the top seeds, the United Kingdom. The two teams met up on the World Cup stage, with the United Kingdom having an advantage in the RC picks, and Singapore having an advantage in the LN picks. This match would turn into something that the viewers would never forget.

- [aespa - Supernova (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238661#mania/4757025) (RC5) @ [47:15](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238887961?t=00h47m15s) - The United Kingdom wanted to pick something they knew they could beat Singapore in, so they picked RC5, a vocal dump map with jacks and streams sprinkled in there to mess up the players. However, United Kingdom might have underestimated Singapore, as Singapore ended up taking the first break point of the match, making the score 3–4.
- [Taishi - Introduction (Bygone) (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238644#mania/4756987) (HB3) @ [1:02:47](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238887961?t=01h02m47s) - The score is now 4–5, with the United Kingdom on the edge of defeat. Singapore chose HB3, a map with mainly LN sections with small rice pattern sections. Unbeknownst to them, the United Kingdom were also strong in hybrid maps, and that in combination with amazing 991k scores from ::{ flag=GB }:: [XxNewson1234xX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9895650) and ::{ flag=GB }:: [Eliminate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9169747) ended up costing them their match point. The bells were ringing... the viewers up out of their seats... it was time for the tiebreaker.
- [Camellia - Antineutrino Witchcraft](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238682#mania/4757059) (TB) @ [1:07:27](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238887961?t=01h07m27s) - This was it — whoever wins this wins the entire match. The map began and many combos broke left and right while the scoreline teetered frantically back and forth. However, someone's combo never broke… and that person was ::{ flag=SG }:: [TheOPmeme](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15763622), carrying their team to victory with an incredible 988k FC on the tiebreaker. With that, Singapore had done the impossible and defeated the United Kingdom.

This was not a regular match — this was a legendary showdown. Both teams played amazingly with Singapore managing to cause an upset and sending the United Kingdom to the losers' bracket. In the Quarterfinals, Singapore will have to face their toughest match-up yet, going up against the #3 seed, Thailand. As for the United Kingdom, they will be going up against the #17 seed, Australia, in an attempt to keep their position in the tournament.

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia

China and Malaysia are quite familiar with each other. They've provided many classic matches before, and by coincidence they met again this time. China has gathered a strong team in the mid-game and try to keep good consistency on every map, while Malaysia is well known as the early game being their skill set, especially for LN maps. As expected, this match was a show.

- [Reizoko Cj - /a/](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238283#mania/4755965) (RC6) @ [35:18](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h35m18s) - This map is quite technical and risky, with roll patterns and long jack combinations making it hard for even the top players to keep good accuracy. China picked this map since they were favoured in the rice category, however that backfired when they lost some accuracy in the roll parts. Meanwhile, the Malaysians had 3 players with no 200s, which netted them their first break point.
- [Taishi - Introduction (Bygone) (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238644#mania/4756987) (HB3) @ [50:43](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h50m43s) - Facing the 4–4 situation with the last pick, Malaysia chose HB3, which contains hard technical and coordination parts that make it extremely difficult to keep accuracy and consistency. China arranged a good consistency line-up, and they ended up with a triple FC totalling 2,968k points, but Malaysia did their best and got a crazy team score totalling 2,975k points. With this, Malaysia secured themselves a match point.
- [Falcom Sound Team jdk - Spiral of Erebos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1605529#mania/3279920) (RC2) @ [56:01](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238945469?t=00h56m01s) - The last pick from China is RC2, where ::{ flag=CN }:: [DawnX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8534840) got an insane score of 998,935, but Malaysia players did better overall, and they kept close to China's score. There was nearly no gap between both teams from start to end, but Malaysia players didn't give China any chances, winning by only 745 points with a triple Score V1 SS.

Both teams performed quite well, and there were many maps where all 6 players FC'd. Most Chinese players kept insane consistency in most maps, while Malaysian players showed their developed accuracy and consistency skill sets which netted them wins on some maps that they considered a high risk. In the next round Malaysia will need to face the strong United States, and China will need to prepare a potential double match with Indonesia and the winner of Argentina vs. Canada.

## Score highlights

Players are beginning to pick up some steam as new rounds go by. To say we have had some standouts would be far from the truth — in fact we've got plenty of them! Not all heroes wear capes; some just want to smash keys.

- ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610)'s performance thus far has been exceptional. Having the best score on **5 picks** this round makes it really hard to pick one to highlight. But their performance in [NU-KO - Pochiko no Shiawase na Nichijou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238649#mania/4757002) (LN2) with a 998,545 score [against Canada](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2239366528) shouldn't be overlooked!
- In a tournament full of prodigies, it is hard to make oneself stand out. And yet, that's exactly what ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) has accomplished, with their astonishing score of 997,947 in [Reizoko Cj - /a/](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238283#mania/4755965) (RC6) in their [match vs. Hong Kong](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2239818596).

We've really only just begun, however. What matters most is who's left standing at the end of the weeks to come.
