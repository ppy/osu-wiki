An osu!catch legend has finally dropped into our Featured Artist library.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/424/header.jpg)

Ranging from [a collection of Ranked osu!catch beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=creator%3D%224847256%22) to his tenure as an osu!catch [Beatmap Nominator](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/28) to his music being featured in the last 3 [osu!catch World Cups](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC), it's no surprise that **0 K** would eventually spread osu!catch into our Featured Artist catalogue!

[**0 K**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/424) is home to **11** modern classical and jazz tunes that you probably wouldn't expect to come out of a rhythm game. ~~This has nothing to do with the allegations of osu!catch not being a rhythm game.~~

Missed this year's osu!catch World Cup? That means you also missed the song **0 K** produced specifically for the tournament:

Even if you don't map osu!catch, we're confident that **0 K** wouldn't mind if you picked a pre-timed beatmap template from [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/424) and started mapping for another mode. So do that.

Once you're done, relax until this time next week, when we'll be announcing another Featured Artist!

Stay tuned.
