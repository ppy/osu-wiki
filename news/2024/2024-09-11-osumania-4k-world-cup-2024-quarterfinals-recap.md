With the Quarterfinals weekend freshly concluded, now is the ideal time to join us in reviewing the best moments and prepare for the upcoming Semifinals.

We are slowly reaching the end stages of MWC 4K, which means the mappools are getting harder, and the top teams are getting chances to fully flex their skills to both their opponents and the community at large. Let's see who are making the headlines.

This time around we're not seeing any new slots put into the mix, but that's not to say the pool hasn't stepped up in difficulty by a surprising amount! Most notably, [sasakure.UK x TJ.hangneil - raputa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242647#mania/4766767) by [[GB]V1do](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17527968) (HB1) bumps up to 242 BPM, which begins to show major weaknesses for many players and their physicality, alongside [The Flashbulb - A Raw Understanding](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1632098#mania/4766799) by [Pizza69](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25285704) (RC4) really signifying the challenge behind purely technical patterning, which is no joke when uprated to 1.15x!

To round up the mappool, we've also got one new [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals)!

Many players across all game modes are familiar with the player, mapper, and artist [cygnus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359), who goes by [Matrix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5052899) on osu!, and this time around they're debuting in MWC 4K with [Tree of Misery](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242640#mania/4766759) charted by [Miaurichesu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055648)!

Taking up the chordjack slot for the round (RC3), it's expecting nothing more from players than straightforward accuracy. You definitely shouldn't underestimate the contents of the chart however, as the chart has *zero* breaks, and it only gets heavier in patterning the further you go. The slightest dent in your score can cause a chain reaction of misses or tank your accuracy if you don't manage your stamina!

Brazil and Mexico is a matchup viewers were excited for, as it could've been anyone's game for the closely seeded teams, both featuring all-rounders. Regular spectators may recall Brazil's past victories in the osu!mania 4K World Cup back in 2020 and 2021.

Team Mexico on the other hand is composed more or less of newcomers who made their first appearance in the main brackets in MWC 4K 2023, so if Mexico wanted to prove that they could take down any fight, this was the match that they had to win.

- [DJ SHARPNEL - KLASSIKER EINHEIT (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242540#mania/4766576) ([YuEast 2018](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13953619), LN2) @ [30:36](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245230506?t=00h30m36s) - The score was 1–2. Brazil ended up picking the densely mapped LN2, requiring strong stamina for a good performance. Unfortunately for Brazil, a couple slip-ups at the end of the map let Mexico barely get the first break point by 2,930 score.
- [cygnus - Tree of Misery](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242640#mania/4766759) ([Miaurichesu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055648), RC3) @ [48:56](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245230506?t=00h48m56s) - Mexico, leading with 2–4, ended up choosing RC3, a consistency chart riddled with chordjacks. This was Brazil's only chance at stealing a break point and turning the match around, and thankfully for Brazil, fortune was on their side.
- [Kou! - Frost Walker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242668#mania/4766814) ([guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), TB) @ [1:13:44](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245230506?t=01h13m44s) - Knock knock, it's tiebreaker time! This chart has been brought to you by the osu!catch World Cup, with its original Grand Finals tiebreaker song. This match itself was way too close throughout, never going over a score difference of 10k. After almost seven minutes of both teams fighting through the cold atmosphere, Brazil managed to take the win with a score difference of 5,670.

Both teams gave it their all this match, with each pick being incredibly close. While Brazil managed to take the win and will be moving on to the Quarterfinals, we can't say the same for Mexico as they are now out of the tournament. We wish Brazil the best of luck and hope Mexico will be able to place better next year.

### ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom vs. ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong

[**You can view the match information here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/115416860)

After a nail-biting match against Singapore last week, the UK once again had a phenomenally close match against an oddly similar foe: Hong Kong. On paper, they had the advantage, with a 76/24 odds split on the pick'ems — but as we saw in the Round of 16, odds can be overturned and flipped in an instant.

This match might've had something never done before — ::{ flag=GB }:: [Eliminate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9169747) and ::{ flag=HK }:: [ATP Koshepen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17115114) (who both played all the maps) [were actually playing from the same physical room](https://www.youtube.com/live/ihNDXRPd4Gc?t=4030s), with an elaborate streaming setup showing both of their perspectives. Very cool to see!

Again, the UK was advantaged in the rice skill set with the strong trio of ::{ flag=GB }:: [Eliminate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9169747), ::{ flag=GB }:: [Zoobin4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055204) and ::{ flag=GB }:: [XxNewson1234xX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9895650) — but Hong Kong was no slouch either. With their strong core of ::{ flag=HK }:: [Quotient](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11313227) and ::{ flag=HK }:: [ATP Koshepen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17115114), they had a definite edge on the LNs, and put up a hell of a fight on rice. Let's review some of the craziest moments of this intense match:

- [Frums - gur yvsr](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242442#mania/4766318) ([Vortex-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4999669), RC6) @ [20:00](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245925227?t=00h20m00s) - This was the UK's second pick, but far from a sure one —the polyrhythms and technical pattern barrages in this map are nothing to scoff at! Things came to a very tense finish, with Hong Kong's advantage swinging wildly in the last few seconds, but prevailing against Britain by a mere 2,400 points.
- [Ushirokara Haiyoritai G - Koi wa Chaos no Shimobenari](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242646#mania/4766766) ([0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707), RC5) @ [30:33](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245925227?t=00h30m33s) - This point was a masterclass, and the UK was the teacher. A short and sweet technical map, where a single miss means so much. Hong Kong misses. The UK doesn't. They played this map twice in this weekend. Those are the top 2 team scores out of every team in the tournament. Enough said.
- [Kou! - Frost Walker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242668#mania/4766814) ([guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), TB) @ [62:40](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245925227?t=01h02m40s) - From a 5–2 lead, and after a tragic break point in the chordjack pick, the UK found themselves at 5–5. After the dust settled from a devastating fusillade of LN patterns, some of them proved to be too much for the Brits, leading to a pretty narrow 7,900-point loss. Actually, this was the second tiebreaker each of these teams played in the tournament, and their positions seem clear. 2 wins for Hong Kong. 2 losses for the United Kingdom.

Commiserations to the British team for their run this year, unfortunately ended by 2 insanely close matches. Congratulations to Hong Kong for fighting on against all odds — next weekend they will face the Philippines in hopes of keeping it alive once more.

## Score highlights

There's no denying that all teams thus far have given their all, especially as we draw ever so closer to the lattermost rounds of the tournament. But this round's standout amongst all teams must've been Japan!

- ::{ flag=JP }:: [[Crz]yomogi237](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28571440) took everyone by surprise with their crazy ratio in [cygnus - Tree of Misery](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242640#mania/4766759) by [Miaurichesu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055648) (RC3), achieving a score of 999,792 with only **10 regular 300s** in their [match against Spain](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2244890379).
- ::{ flag=JP }:: [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) covered Japan's SV needs with their astonishing 997,856 score on [Tanger - BREAKME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242663#mania/4766804) by [Promachos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14069486) (SV1) in their [match versus Brazil](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2245937607).

Will they be able to hold up next week? Will the other teams keep their edge? Whatever the case may be, Japan has proved that they are a force to be reckoned with.
