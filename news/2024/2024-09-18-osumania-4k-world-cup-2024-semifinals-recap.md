The walls are slowly closing in for the remaining teams, and only the top 6 are making it to the Finals. It's time to lock in, review the previous week, and prepare ourselves for the upcoming showdown of epic proportions.

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K/img/mwc4k2024-banner.jpg)

At this point in the tournament, teams cannot get away with just raw skill. They must watch and analyse their opponents and make sure they make all the right moves at any given point.

Matches slowly turn into masterful showcases of not just skill, but the team's knowledge of the opposing team and their strengths and weaknesses. Each match is played like a delicate dance of tango, where nothing but perfect strategy and execution leads to victory, with teams constantly looking for any smallest missteps by their opponents.

Let us ponder no more and take a look at the best matches of this week, where we'll see which teams stepped best to the beat, and which teams stumbled to their feet.

With Semifinals comes the second and last time we see two new slots put into the mix, first being stamina (RC3), with [Black Chocolates](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1433708#mania/3401103) by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707). The stamina pick is usually similar to the jumpstream pick, with the big difference being that it plays differently and goes on for much longer, which is a large reason why it's named stamina in the first place.

The final new slot is LN4, which is made to contrast [lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052)'s chart of [AZISAI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246365#mania/4775956) for LN3, which itself is very shield-heavy for this specific round.

To explain the pool difficulty (and what exactly LN4 is), it's best to let the **3 new [originals](/wiki/osu!_originals)** from this round do the talking!

[Vortex-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4999669) has had a following for a long time, and after going over a year without any new uploads, he makes a return with [Hubris](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246389#mania/4776009) by [kaitendaentai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/364)!

Taking up the final rice slot, it takes on a similar approach for what we've seen in previous rounds, where it's heavy on 1/4 jumpstream and has scary bursts. The bursts are all over the place, ranging from short 1/6 streams or 1/3 jack-heavy sections. Anyone who's enjoyed a Vortex- chart in the past will be sure to enjoy this one.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-09-18-osumania-4k-world-cup-2024-semifinals-recap/void_of_altair.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246375#mania/4775984)

Our second original lands in the hybrid category. Charted by [gzdongsheng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8660315), we're brought [Void Of Altair](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246375#mania/4775984) by resident osu!mania player [Akiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19587411)!

With Akiri already having a large amount of originals in their catalogue, you can expect no less from this one. Leaning heavily on minijacks and jacks, with a copious amount of shields thrown your way for good measure and some 1/8 snaps between LNs to throw you off, this chart challenges those with good finger control.

Last, but CERTAINLY not least, [Kabocha](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/345) and incredible vocalist [Aitsuki Nakuru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127) bring [Dear The Night I Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246380#mania/4775997) charted by [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) and [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)!

If you're at all familiar with their song *Lilith*, you're familiar with this one. This is the aforementioned LN4, and it's much more stream/snap focused, leading to smooth patterns that can have a heavy toll on your accuracy due to the nature of how staggered (just about) every release is. All long note players are sure to enjoy this one.

## Semifinals results

The table keeps getting smaller, but the matches keep getting spicier.

In these tables, Team A is the higher seed, or in other words performed better in the Qualifiers, yet at this level, such orderings determine less of the outcome.

| **Philippines** ::{ flag=PH }:: | **7** | 3 | ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong |

### ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines vs. ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong

The losers' bracket is a scary position to be in, especially late into the tournament. The Philippines got here thanks to Chile just last round, losing against them 6–2. As for team Hong Kong, they've been clawing their way up the losers' bracket with a clutch victory against the United Kingdom, winning the last four picks when they needed it most.

As both Philippines and Hong Kong entered the World Cup stage, viewers knew that this was going to be one hell of a match.

- [trapman - minefield outlaw](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246339#mania/4775913) ([guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), RC4) @ [13:53](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2250787141?t=00h13m53s) - 1–0, Hong Kong's turn to pick, and their pick was RC4, a stamina-draining chordjack map with tricky patterns waiting to break combos. While Hong Kong was able to stay in the lead for a good chunk of the map, a few combo breaks near the end of the map let the Philippines take the break point.
- [YOASOBI - Idol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246343#mania/4775926) ([0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707), RC6) @ [18:29](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2250787141?t=00h18m29s) - Hong Kong needed revenge from the Philippines if they wanted to stay alive. The Philippines brazenly chose to keep picking rice, now with a vocal stream dump map, despite Hong Kong's exceptional rice skills. This pick ended up being way too close with a score difference not even 10k, and in the end, Hong Kong managed to respond in kind with a break point.
- [Tatsh - Joker -Vocaloid ver.-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246033#mania/4775287) ([Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082), RC1) @ [58:25](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2250787141?t=00h58m25s) - It's now match point for the Philippines at 6–3. It was time for Hong Kong to make their pick, and their pick was RC1, a dense stream map with practically zero breaks. Hong Kong needed to win if they wanted to continue having a fighting chance at taking this to the tiebreaker. All was going well, until the combos broke from the Hong Kong side at the end, resulting in the Philippines winning the match.

Well... that was certainly a match. However, we will have to say our goodbyes to the Hong Kong team as they are now officially out of the tournament. Your underrated performances that shocked many viewers will not be forgotten, and we hope for a better run next year. As for the Philippines, they will be facing up against the almighty South Korean team which has previously dominated the osu!mania World Cup. We wish them the very best of luck.

### ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

In 2022's MWC 4K, China was beaten by Japan in the Semifinals, and by coincidence, they met in same round again this year. Both teams have changed a lot since: China just swept Vietnam in round 1, while Japan successfully defeated Singapore without much trouble. It is well known that Japan has a strong roster with impressive raw skill, and that Chinese players have great consistency in every skill set. Both teams are also strong in SV, and that ended up being the key to winning this match.

- [DJ SHARPNEL - Black Chocolates](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1433708#mania/3401103) ([Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707), RC3) @ [12:14](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251756726?t=00h12m14s) - Japan gunned it straight for the rice picks, starting off with RC3, where they were immediately able to show dominance with ::{ flag=JP }:: [Na2303](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/31146692) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [13wiz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33801604) getting 2 v1 SS scores, and ::{ flag=JP }:: [AFOTHER](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10242062) dropping a single 100. China tried their best to keep up, but the ratio gap kept them off Japan's back, ultimately ending up with no answer to Japan's team score of 2,987,816 points, and 1–1 as the scoreline.
- [Terminal 11 - Cold Heart Remix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246337#mania/4775909) ([Pizza69](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25285704), RC5) @ [47:16](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251756726?t=00h47m16s) - The match was 7 maps in without any break points, making the score 3–4 for China. Japan, after picking RC 2 through 4, opted to stick to what they do best, and picked RC5. Unfortunately for Japan, China was very strong on this pick, and a miss by ::{ flag=JP }:: [AFOTHER](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10242062) near the end of the map sealed the deal and granted China their first break point, creating a point gap between the two teams.
- [t+pazolite - Beatboxer VS Trackmaker feat. KAJI & Kohey](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246368#mania/4775966) ([AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799), SV2) @ [01:01:12](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251756726?t=01h01m12s) - China was on a roll after winning their first break point, making the score 3–6 in their favour. After much consideration, Japan picked SV2, a map that China had already played the day before, in hopes of turning the tides. [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604), considered by some as the best player in the world, scored 997,336 points and was ahead of the pack by a lot. However, that couldn't save Japan as China's team cobbled together an amazing team score of 2,956,661, securing themselves the map.

As seed #13, it was already a good result for Japan to arrive to the top 8. Now it is the time to congratulate China for stepping into the Finals after a 6-year-long effort. Next week, they will be facing another familiar team, Chile, which is a match that cannot be missed.

## Score highlights

The third to last round ended a few days ago, and with that, the finals grow ever closer. To the layman, the maps are starting to become nigh unreadable, but that has yet to stop our players from pulling up Herculean scores!

- It's no surprise to see ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) highlighted again. Their performance throughout the tournament has simply been stellar. Their play on [yuikonnu - Uchouten Vivace (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246331#mania/4775902) by [Miaurichesu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055648) (RC2) isn't any different however, achieving a score of 999,649 [against the United States](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251402252).
- ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) may be a new name in the spotlight, but the community already knows what they're capable of. They managed to score one of the highest combined total scores from three separate LN picks. Their peak performance was seen with their score of 995,993 in [Hino Isuka - Dreamin' attraction!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2246225#mania/4775650) (LN2) by [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811) [versus South Korea](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2251727183).
