The ballot box has been chained up, and the results have been tallied up. This edition of the skinning contest has seen **1,839** community members cast a total of **4,637** votes across **28** different entries. It's time to dive in head first, see which entries topped the charts, and most importantly which one secured itself the coveted #1 spot.

### 3rd place - ROSULA

Inspired by the design of [Navia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Navia) from *Genshin Impact*, [Chromasia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7306251) has once again put themselves near the top of the list. Even though this is their 3rd time entering a skinning contest, they have quickly solidified themselves in the upper echelon of the skinning community. Their newest entry, [ROSULA](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1925929), basks users with tastefully placed golden yellow accents across the entire skin, along with Navia as the centre piece on the song selection screen.

This skin ticks all the aesthetically pleasing boxes, but is also a very functional gameplay skin, which is why Chromasia was able to snag themselves 3rd place with **401** votes.

### 2nd place - echoing inside.

It's hard to talk about modern skinning without mentioning [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482) at least once. Consistently ranking in the top 3 of all recent skinning competitions, they have proven themselves as a top-tier skinner. Their newest entry, [echoing inside.](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1925867), is themed around [Robin](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Robin), a character from *Honkai: Star Rail*, and thetasigma has used the character's colour palette extensively throughout the skin, with a focus on simplistic gameplay.

Gacha gamers recognised thetasigma's efforts and gave them good RNG, which they used to pull **531** votes, no pity mechanics required.

### 1st place - Phosphor

[Miorine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12630408) has strayed away from the usual anime girl themes and focused instead on the topic of nostalgia with their entry, [Phosphor](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1920571). After barely losing out on 1st place during last year's [Skin of the Year](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-02-05-skin-of-the-year-2023-results) contest, they have once again returned with more of an 80s-style skin, throwing all of us back to the times of CRTs, floppy disks and beige-painted plastics wherever you look.

Players might even find themselves more immersed into the theme in gameplay rather than the song selection screen, with a unique take on the playable border that's completely skinned out to look like you are actually playing on a CRT. We'd also like to shout out osu!mania's unique playfield as well, as it's been completely reskinned to look like a never-ending punch card.

These are only some of the reasons that the community liked this entry so much that they voted **806** times for it, which put it a whopping **275** votes above 2nd place!
