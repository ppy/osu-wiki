Attention all osu!taiko mappers, gather your fellow countrymen and prepare for a showdown never seen before!

![](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2024/img/banner.jpg)

The osu!taiko Mapping World Cup is a country-based, multi-stage osu!taiko mapping contest on a scale unlike anything seen previously in the osu!taiko scene. Countries will battle it out over multiple rounds of mapping, completing specific challenges along the way, to decide which is definitively the best mapping country out there.

Team sizes will range from 3 to 6 people, with the ability to have multiple teams per country depending on the amount of sign-ups.

If you want to read more about the rules, contest format, schedule, and judging criteria, please check out this contest's [wiki page](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2024) and [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1865674) for more information.

## Registrations

Registrations are open from now until June 8th! To register, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/8da1riW77rrTUd2R9), and join the contest's [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/A33s9SU9Bt) to stay up to date with the latest news and announcements.

If you have issues with submitting your registration through the form, please [send ikin5050 a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4007649).

After registrations close, the [organisation team](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2024#organisation) will review all submissions, appoint captains of each country, and provide them a list of potential teammates to choose from. If this person does not want to be captain, a replacement will be selected. The captains will be responsible for selecting their teammates. If more than 6 people sign up for a single country, more than one team may be fielded. In this case a captain will be delegated for each team.

Do note that it's required for the team captains to be present in the Discord server to keep up with any announcements or changes related to the contest.

## Prizes

The top 3 countries that reign supreme will be awarded with the following prizes:

- **1st place:** Cash prize, [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points), and a shiny profile badge.
- **2nd place:** Cash prize and contest points.
- **3rd place:** Cash prize and contest points.
