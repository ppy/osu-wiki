Let your eardrums experience the latest addition to our Featured Artist catalogue!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/435/header.jpg)

*Normal1zer*, *Broken Nerdz*, *The Doll Reaper*, *5-let*, *Noma Nadeshiko*, and... we'll stop listing there. This artist has more aliases than we can reasonably count, but most people know him as **Supa7onyz**: a Chinese producer who's emerging in both rhythm games and doujin communities!

A grand total of **13** tracks are part of [**Supa7onyz**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435), all of which are both pre-timed and undeniably awesome.

While we're proud to bring **Supa7onyz** in as our newest Featured Artist, this isn't his first rodeo. osu! players who've spread their wings to other rhythm game players may know his role as sound engineer/director for *Paradigm:Reboot*, or one of his songs featured in games like *Phigros* and *Orzmic*, or even his involvement in osu! tournaments like *o!m LN3* or *MCNC7K 2023*.

Most recently though, just about everyone should know him for his newest [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) revealed literally today in the ongoing [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K)! For the clueless folks out there, witness his new tune in this video (and check out the other song previews):

[**Supa7onyz**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435) awaits your mouse clicks (two specifically: one to download a pretimed `.osz`, and another to open the file with osu!). Once in the editor, it'll only be about 50,000 clicks before you're done with a map!

Instead of a new Featured Artist next week, we'll be announcing an update to the catalogue for one of our older artists! That still means we'll be throwing a ton of cool music your direction, so stay tuned.
