Sometimes in order to keep the cogs turning, you need someone who does a little bit of everything. In this anniversary interview of The Followpoint, you'll learn more about such a person!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-12-05-the-followpoint-hivie-the-man-of-many-things/banner.jpg)

Welcome or welcome back to The Followpoint, a series where we interview various players and community figures to get to know them better! The series' first anniversary happened just last month (November 10), which means we're interviewing someone special both to us and the osu! community in general, [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976)!

Hivie is an [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team) member, but is also a [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) leader, [Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) manager, [medal](/wiki/Medals) coordinator, among so many other things. If you've been active in mapping or development discussion over the past years, you've surely seen him around! Funnily enough, [our first interview](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-11-10-the-followpoint-ephemeral-the-man-behind-the-medals) was with [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335), who also was a community maintainer and medal developer. That, and the fact that Hivie often helps us with polishing our interviews, makes interviewing him that much more fitting for today!

This interview will look slightly different from the ones you got used to, as we'd like to make it in the spirit of our first one. That means it will be less flow-based, but the questions will still be split into categories.

I'd also like to say something at the end of this interview, but first things first, let's see what Hivie has to say!

Hello Hivie, thank you so much for agreeing to this interview! First up, could you please give us a short introduction on who you are and what you usually do in osu! team?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

Hello! I'm a random person on the internet whose little corner in the world is osu!. I've been part of the [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team) for the past 3 years and I've been doing a lot of things there, primarily [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) leadership, osu! medals, running the [Daily Challenge](/wiki/Gameplay/Daily_challenge), and a bunch of other internal housekeeping stuff. I do also contribute to other areas like [Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved), [Tournament Committee](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee), [MBC](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest), [osu! wiki](/wiki/osu!_wiki) maintenance, and so on.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

How did you find osu! and what was your impression of it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

My first encounter in osu! was actually in 2017 through some YouTube video, I didn't really like it because it set my first impression to "silly anime game". Fast-forward to early 2019, I was actually in my newbie anime enjoyer phase and was looking for a new game to play because I started to dread playing FPS games all the time. So, the reason that drove me away from the game is the same one that got me into it years later.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Are you familiar with the original Taiko no Tatsujin series?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

Yes, briefly. Being an osu!taiko player made it mandatory for me to know it, so to say. Unlike many players, it had nothing with me getting into osu!taiko, tho I wish I'd get to play it one day on an arcade machine.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Why did you choose to be an osu!taiko player among all game modes there are?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

I first took a serious interest in osu!taiko during my early mapping journey. After 4 months of osu! mapping, I felt like I've hit a wall (as many other new mappers) and struggled to improve. While I was watching some of [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)'s videos, I stumbled upon his [osu!taiko mapping video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM0bUdpptsY), which motivated me to try mapping something on osu!taiko.

On 1 January 2020 I submitted [my first osu!taiko beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1087013), then I reached out to an osu!taiko NAT asking for beginner tips/resources, and they directed me to the [osu!taiko Modding & Mapping Hub Discord server](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers#mapping-and-modding). There, I've found a very welcoming community full of heartwarming people who were more than willing to help new people, which made me feel right at home. I started playing and mapping osu!taiko more and more, and eventually, I got hooked.

Nowadays, while my monthly playcount is low, I still play osu! and osu!taiko pretty equally.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What is your source of motivation to stay involved in basically all aspects of osu! even after all these years?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

the osu! community has been, and still is, a once in a lifetime experience for me, and I've grown attached to all the workflows and people I've met along the way. The reason I'm still here, and will be for the foreseeable future, is because it's a place that I can call *home* in some form, despite the ups and downs.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What would you call the greatest gift that osu! has given you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

I want to name 2 things:

1. People skills: I've been a pretty timid person for a good chunk for my life, and osu! has helped me develop my social skills in a way I didn't expect, both through working together on projects, and through managing and leading teams.
2. Programming skills: I've been studying in the computer science field for the past 5 years, and for a while, people around me kept emphasizing the importance of experience rather than just theoretical knowledge. osu! has been a great place for me to seek said experience through working on various projects development-wise (i.e. contributing to the [BN website](https://bn.mappersguild.com), making my own [Discord bot](https://github.com/Hiviexd/AxerBot), and many other internal tools/script that proved their convenience when needed), and my involvement has always pushed me to always learn new things and improve my current capabilities.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Is there anything you would change about the osu!taiko community?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

Currently? I'd wish for people to stay. In recent years, taiko has been on a slow decline in terms of player and mapper activity, with many veterans and experienced people quitting, and not enough new people interested in honing their skills and staying. I'd love to see more people stay when they try to get more involved with the community, as we currently have a lot of passerbys who don't stick around after reaching Muzukashiis, or after making their first couple of maps.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Do you have plans to grind osu!taiko and get better at it? Or maybe just casually playing sometimes?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

Uh, hard to say. If you look at my [playcount graph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976#historical), you'll notice that I've yet to reach 1,000 plays a month since September 2019, which happens to be around the time I started mapping lol. Mapping and everything else has been taking most of my free time, leaving me with little patience and motivation to properly grind the game.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-12-05-the-followpoint-hivie-the-man-of-many-things/playgraph.jpg)

However, I do get motivation sparks once every few months, and my improvement has been steady. My current goal is to reach #1 country rank, which I'm around 400pp away from.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

And before we move to the next section, how did you join the osu! team originally?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

I joined the osu!team in March 2023 following my appointment as NAT leader. From there, it opened many opportunities for me and motivated me to contribute to the game on a very close level, so I kept going at it with no regrets.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Now, let's talk about mapping a little. How did you get into mapping and even eventually became an NAT leader?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

Oh I still remember this day like yesterday lol. On a random day in August 2019, I was chilling in a VC with a couple of old friends and we were playing in a multi. Eventually, we were all bored and were trying to figure out what to do next. I was browsing /r/osugame on the side and I stumble upon a post about some map getting Ranked, So I suggested that we should try mapping, and everyone was on board. After a week of messing around with the editor, my friends lost interest and I was the only one left. I initially liked the aspect of interacting with other community members to get mods/GDs, so I kept going.

I really loved the community aspect of the game and it gave me a unique sense of belonging. I've set myself on a track to give back to the community as much as I can, and it shortly led me to the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) in January 2021, a position I never thought I'd be in.

Being a BN and being proactive towards contributing to the game has set me for so many opportunities. I've contributed to Project Loved, mentored (and eventually became an organiser) for the Community Mentorship Program, organized the Mapper's Choice Awards, worked on one of the revivals of Beatmap Spotlights, and even hosted my own beatmapping contests. All of these experiences have helped me meet so many people and learn so much about the game and its community.

Thankfully, my efforts didn't go unnoticed, and on November 2022 I was added to the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), which was a turning point for me, as it allowed me to work on a more impactful level and help build the future of the osu!taiko community, which made me take my responsibilities more more seriously than ever.

During March 2023, the NAT was dealing with serious organisational issues, momentum was slowing down and the team was in a dire need of a proactive hand that could help steer the ship back on track. So, months of lengthy discussions eventually led to the team unanimously appointing [radar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7131099) and me as leaders of the group, which had us officially join the osu! team.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

As a mapper, what do you appreciate the most in Beatmap Nominators?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

I appreciate how integral their role is in the grand scheme of things, they're a silent force that keeps our ecosystem running. People tend to either not grasp or underestimate the amount of effort and time they put into their work, and it's pretty sad to see them being easily used as scapegoats for any mapping disputes.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

If you had to choose the best osu!taiko beatmap (in your opinion), which one would that be and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

It's pretty hard to label a single beatmap as the best, so I'll just shout out a couple of maps that I always praise whenever I get the chance:

- [Camellia - Looking for Edge of Ground](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1678197#taiko/3428627) by [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091), one of my most favourite Camellia songs paired by a map that *perfectly* compliments every detail in the song. The SV usage is prominent yet elegant, the patterning is top-notch, and overall there's nothing that could've been done better with the map.
- [Madobe Rika - Panda Hero](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1832848#taiko/3762478) by [_Rise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5217107), winner of the [Mapping to Pander: Taiko #1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1624880?n=1) contest. A very energetic map and song, some intense SVs with fun tech-y patterns — what more can you ask for! My most favourite part would be the stream on 02:58:685. It's idea is so simple yet so perfectly effective.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Speaking of beatmaps, do you have any advice you would give to new mappers? Or those who just plan to try, but are too scared?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

My one advice is to try. Whether it's submitting your first map, finishing that one map of a song you love, posting your map in a modding queue, or even just asking for help in a mapping server. So many opportunities of learning and growth can be attained by simply trying. The one thing special about the osu! community is how welcoming and helpful it can get, which is a feeling that has been lost to time in many other places.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What are your thoughts on the current state of medals?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

I think we've come a long way with medals, which is kind of surprising considering how limited the scope of medals is with osu!(stable). However, I feel like we've started to plateau in terms of creativity and variety. That's why I'm really looking forward to when we start releasing osu!(lazer)-exclusive medals. The possibilities there are much, *much* more vast with the gigantic library of mods, and how feasible is it to integrate medals in other areas technically (i.e. multiplayer).

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What do you like about developing them the most?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

osu! medal hunters are insane schizos (in a good way), and trying to match that energy when brainstorming medals is always fun.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Speaking of development, do you have any ETA on when medals will display which map you received them on?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

Honestly I'm not sure, It might go against the spirit of secrecy with Hush-Hush medals, so it will need further consideration by the osu! team.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

And another question about dev side: When (and if) we will see multiplayer medals? In his interview Ephemeral mentioned having an idea of a zombie-like medal. 👀

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

Sooner than you might think!

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Personally, what's your favorite medal, and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Hivie.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">Hivie</a></p>

My personal favourite was a now-scrapped medal that involved getting a good score on a beatmap that you recently submitted. I loved how in theory it could've been a great way to introduce players to the editor, but unfortunately it backfired hard and caused a ton of low effort spam content to flood the pending section, which caused the medal to be unfortunately but rightfully scrapped.

Other than that, I'd consider Unwilted to be up there. I enjoy medals that you have a chance of obtaining naturally rather than actively grinding for them.

Before we finish medals part, I **have to** ask this question: New medals when? :3

Soon™

Jokes aside, we've been hard at work on a batch that's bigger than usual (which may or may not introduce a new category!!) that we're hoping to release before the end of the year. After that, we're going to try to commit to a more frequent schedule but with smaller batches.

Finally, let me ask a few more questions for you as an osu! team member. What do you like contributing to the most and why?

Has to be anything related to managing the NAT and the mapping community. It's by far the area I've put the most time and effort in, especially when considering that my beginnings were from the mapping scene.

Doing things there feels... natural for me. I really enjoy pushing positive change there and making sure things run smoothly. Additionally, I tend to enter a satisfying flow state whenever I'm grinding a proposal or doing some problem solving for a BN website feature implementation.

Despite the ups and downs (and the occasional stress waves I have to deal with), I find this to be the highlight of my overall activity.

What advice would you give to people who want to contribute to osu!, but don't know where to start or what they can even do?

osu! is one of the few communities where you can contribute in so many ways! Let's go through some examples:

- Modding beatmaps is always a great way to start. It's an important part of the mapping ecosystem and is always in demand. Consider starting your modding journey via a [modding queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/726725?n=1).
- Once you feel experienced enough with modding, you can give [applying](https://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps) to join the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) a chance! You'll be at your closest to maintaining the pillars of the mapping community via directly promoting official content of the game.
- If mapping or modding isn't your jam, consider looking into community projects, such as [tournaments](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/55), or join the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) to keep up with the latest official and community projects!
- If you're more of a technical person, hone your skills via the following:
  - Be a part of the game's [client](https://github.com/ppy/osu) or [website](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) development.
  - Help out with [maintaining the osu! wiki](/wiki/osu!_wiki/Contribution_guide).
  - Head to the `#osu-news` channel in the osu! Discord server and take a jab at news coverage by writing articles on new ideas, or contributing to existing news projects.

Alright, that's all for today. Thank you for your time and answering my questions, Hivie!

Well, it's already been more than a year since our first interview news post got released... I'm not really good at writing speeches for such events, but I'll still try.

First of all, I'd like to say my thanks to everyone who helped and contributed to The Followpoint in any way, from its beginning to where we are now! Thank you [Habib (DigitalHypno)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207) for helping us when we were just starting out, everyone who helped us contact our interviewees when we couldn't do that ourselves, [Ed (BTMC)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) and other content creators for supporting our series and helping it get more popular, [Tanza](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10379965) for creating our "brand" images and news post banners, [xooty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598) and my other friends for their huge support when things were tough, those who worked with me on The Followpoint interviews (mainly [Utiba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436)), [Wala](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079) and [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976) for reviewing our interviews and making sure they are of the best quality they can be, our interviewees, and of course, thanks to all of our readers (especially those who are with us from the very first interview :3)! You all are the best! 💗

To be honest, I never could have imagined that The Followpoint will become such a big thing, especially with it originally being a single interview with Ephemeral, that was done specifically for the osu! Medal Hunters community. But then someone suggested that this could be a cool interviews series, and look where we are now! We managed to contact people I never even thought would respond and agree to an interview, received so much love and support, with some even offering their help... It honestly still feels kinda unreal, but I'm really happy to be where we are right now, and I hope you are as well!

Despite all the problems we had to overcome, this is an amazing journey we are having so far, and we will keep making it even better for everyone involved! Don't forget that we are open to any feedback you may have, so please don't hesitate to suggest things or even interviewees. And speaking of feedback, we recently asked you on our socials if you would read longer interviews, and majority said that they are actually too short right now, so we will try to make them longer, while of course keeping the quality of questions high.

That's all I had to say for now, so please look forward to a new interview coming out in the next three weeks, and make sure to keep an eye on the news feed! You may also follow [@The_Followpoint on Twitter](https://twitter.com/The_Followpoint) or [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thefollowpoint.megamix.dev) to see more updates and question submissions for future interviews.

And as always, see you next time! <3
