16 top players, all no strangers to the highest echelons of competitive osu!, were pitted against each other between April and May. The stage was a [mappool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OoI_ZYh9TDTSaljTMgfI3pyfxXom_xoC01mXqz1fc7M/edit#gid=175106588) featuring challenging beatmaps interspersed with classics of community-wide collective memory.

With the final showmatch of the tournament concluded, today might be the perfect time to unravel the unique audiovisual competitive experience that was Corsace Closed 2024.

## Tournament results

Congratulations to [maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961), [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) and [enri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8640970) for clinching the top 3 spots.

Due to unfortunate circumstances however, the Grand Finals match could not be played as scheduled. However, spectators excited for a legendary showdown between tournament titans [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) and [maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) were not let down, because [a showmatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwMCXxlIs3E) was able to happen and everyone was able to see what would've happened were they to fight for all the marbles:

</div>

The result? A grand rerun of most songs in the mappool using cumulative points (i.e. all scores on all maps summed together) to decide the victor, which turned out to be [maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961).

That said, the Corsace Closed experience wasn't only comprised by the ending. In case you missed the streams, the [Corsace YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Corsace) has compiled a [playlist of ~15 min highlights from each stage](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEl1E3ToUuS2brmDLF0EWE2hCrsmg-mHn). All the VODs can be found on the channel as well.

It's a rare sight to see the community push osu! into new media. While the [last community osu! manga project](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-11-20-the-first-osu-manga-osu-combat-championship) is yet ongoing, this time we get to see a complete Corsace/train-themed story.

If you've at all followed Corsace in the past, you may have noticed that they have a [mascot, affectionally called *secretary-chan* by fans](https://twitter.com/corsace_/status/1646343143930068994). This is a story about her and the legacy she's leaving for *Chloe*, the new poster girl of Corsace (who you can see in the below video).

And it doesn't stop there, because the lore runs deep. You can find 4 instalments of the *Corsace Closed [4-koma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonkoma)* on the [@corsace_ Twitter account](https://twitter.com/corsace_) ([1](https://twitter.com/corsace_/status/1782576118052085790), [2](https://twitter.com/corsace_/status/1785111830563590238), [3](https://twitter.com/corsace_/status/1787648543693693066), [4](https://twitter.com/corsace_/status/1790185259062980643)). This smaller-scale series captures the more minute interactions and bits between the characters, sometimes even crossing over with other tournament mascots like IRIS from [Project Prism](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-04-19-project-prism-2024-registrations-now-open).

[alden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545323), one of the writers, had the following to say about this whole project:

> The secretary was originally an inside joke between [koitsumii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6271053) who is her designer, and I. Although we were happy it got the attention that it did, koitsumii didn't want the secretary to be a mascot moving forward.
> 
> Respecting her decision, I teamed up with [Nemururin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26391825) to create a new mascot which you all eventually came to know as Chloe (Chloe was designed and teased as early as [2023's GF NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1988571#osu/4131039) where she could be seen in the background! We knew no matter what we did, moving on from the secretary was going to be hard. We wanted to capture these feelings of moving on in the story. As such, we centered the one-shot around the theme of change.
> 
> The oneshot itself was a happy accident as I had randomly caught wind of [Honbae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9474976) and [Fulserish](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14252162) interested in making a oneshot revolving around the secretary in February. After reaching out and an initial planning phase, the entire month of March was spent scriptwriting, storyboarding, drawing and revising. It was miracle we got it all done within a month and I'm so proud of the team.
> 
> I don't want to spoil too much but we already have projects planned revolving Chloe for next year so please look forward to it!

Thank you to [alden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545323), [Fulserish](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14252162), [Honbae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9474976), [Liyah](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14290191), [Mio](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28142111), [Nemururin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26391825) and [Piggy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14257673) for bringing these characters to life!
