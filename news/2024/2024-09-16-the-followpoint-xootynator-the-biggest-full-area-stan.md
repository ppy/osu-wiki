Hi xooty, thanks for agreeing to our interview! Let's start with the classic, could you please introduce yourself for the people who don't know you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

Of course! I'm xooty or Lily, a competitive osu! player and streamer! I've been playing osu! for almost 11 years now and streaming for 6 years... I think I'm most known for playing with a very large tablet or for being one of the core players of OWC Canada, or because I'm a silly girl with two even sillier pet birds.

Oh, so you have pets? Do you mind telling us more about them?

I have two little budgies right now, the blue one is Oatmeal and the yellow one is Daffy! They're both strays so I don't know exactly how old they are, but I think around 3-4 years. Oatmeal flew in to my apartment one day and I've kept her since, and Daffy is from a local bird shelter! They're the loudest and rowdiest creatures I've ever met but I love them both to bits. (Daffy's not trying to escape in the photo she just likes sitting there for some reason)

How did you get into drawing? Was there anything that motivated you to learn it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

I got into art when I was very young, always doodling on my homework and such. I first got a tablet when I was 12 years old and was pretty into my DeviantArt and Instagram phase doing a lot of My Little Pony stuff... but I think what inspired me the most as a child was looking at old concept art for games that my cousins and I would play. I have a soft spot in my heart for the concept work of the game Scaler, which featured fantasy landscapes and creatures!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What would you call your favorite tablet and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

Honestly I haven't used many tablets during my career since I always like to get something that's good quality and will last me a long time. My first tablet ever was the CTH-670 by Wacom, but sometime in 2021 I decided to get a CTH-680 since I hover and the hover distance was a lot better. I also really like the Wacom customization for the pen functions since I do art, so I think I will be sticking with the CTH-680 for a long time.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

How did you get introduced to osu! and what was your first impression of it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

My first introduction to osu! was actually in grade 4. I have a vivid memory of someone playing [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan](/wiki/FAQ#i've-never-played-this-"ouendan"-thing-â€”-what-is-it) on their DS outside the gym, and I think there were some visuals of a guy trying to impress a girl on a date, and if you missed any notes then [the guy would turn into a werewolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ23nUvSDOQ&t=1085s)...

Eventually when I started highschool, I saw people playing osu! on the school computers. It felt like some spiritual sign that I should play it since I always had that fond memory of that time by the gym. So at some point I tried it at home and the rest is pretty much history. I don't remember much of my first days of the game but I knew I was hooked right away. I still play it to this day after all!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

When choosing a nickname for osu!, how did you come up with "xootynator"? Is there any special meaning in it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

Not at all, I'm pretty sure I was bootynator for about 2 days until having a shower thought that "xooty" would look much cooler than "booty" ðŸ˜¼

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Speaking of nicknames, what made you change your username to "his kitten" for some time?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

That was from my first subathon in 2023! I had a subscriber goal to change my name to anything chat chose, and they ended up choosing "his kitten". Everyone wanted me to change it back to xootynator after a while, but I maybe got a little attached to the name... meow :3

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

I remember you mentioning it in one of your previous interviews, but can you tell us what's the origin of SFA (Stan Full Area)? And how did that become your thing?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

Stan Full Area has a pretty funny origin, since it was actually our team name for the 2020 iteration of [MRC (Mahloola Regional Cup)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1136787). The team was me, [Rupertion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5774823) and [Eddie-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3898396), three players who played with the entire area of our tablets. No changes to the size of the active area at all. Eddie is a big k-pop fan, so gave us the name Stan Full Area. Since then, it's sort of just stuck as a tag to recognize other people with the same play style!

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What would you call the greatest gift that osu! has given you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

osu! has given me so many opportunities in my life that it's crazy when I look back on it. Not only do I have the opportunity to travel and meet people around the world, have fun and make a career out of something I love AND feel like I have the drive to better my content and my skills, osu! also gave me the greatest gift of being able to connect with people.

I'm not very social, and I keep to myself most of the time, but I've made long-lasting friendships during my entire time on osu!. I feel like I've gained a family. The community can seem toxic at times online, but from my experience, it's never the reality when you get to know people. Not only that, but building my own little community has also allowed people I know to make great connections and friendships with other people. When I take a step back, I feel like a little spider that's woven a big web of connections to all different kinds of aspects of my life. Without osu! I would be very different!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Did streaming push you into becoming a top player, or was it vice versa?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

I think it kind of goes both ways, but I totally started streaming and doing content creation because of the drive to become a top player. I have practically never had an osu! session off stream since I got unbanned in 2018 (that's a whole other story). I started posting on YouTube shortly after my first OWC appearance in late 2020, which really kickstarted my career. I wanted to do something every week that would get people interested. Be that FCing every map in my first match, or carrying my team to victory by taking extra mods on FreeMod picks. That ended up giving me a lot of traction on Twitch, and I used that as leverage to keep pushing my competitive skill and get better!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Who or what was your main inspiration to improve when you just started playing?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

The first player I looked up to was [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328). I remember spectating back in the day and pretty much discovering maps other than generic anime aim existed. I have another core memory of spectating them and seeing the map [Arousing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=title%3D%22%22Arousing%22%22) by [DJ TOTTO feat. Sunao Yoshikawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=artist%3D%22%22DJ%20TOTTO%20feat.%20Sunao%20Yoshikawa%22%22), and I fell in love with tech mapping ever since then. I also think it helped me become a much more rounded player!

Who would you want to meet IRL the most if you could choose any player, and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

The first person that comes to mind is probably [val0108](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/243917). I love pretty much all of their maps, and I used to always love the little Twitter updates they'd post about their life! At one point val0108 came in to my Twitch chat, and I was star struck. I remember them saying something about my scores being cool with full area, it was inspiring, and I just think that val has a silly personality!

How different do LAN tourneys feel from regular tourneys played at home?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

Totally a night and day difference. I've always loved the pro player community since everyone is super friendly even competitively. I feel like everyone can recognize a good match and not be too sour if things don't go their way, so overall a really great experience. Playing at a LAN is a totally different story though! I can just go right up and hug my opponent after a good match! During my time at [The Roundtable](/wiki/Tournaments/The_Roundtable) LAN in LA, I even got to rub elbows with [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) while playing against him during the 1v1's. Looking over at each other, commenting on our scores, and even having people walk around and see the matches happening at real time feels so surreal. I'm for sure saying yes to any LAN I get invited to if I can go!

How do you manage nerves/shake when setting leaderboard scores?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

My best piece of advice for nerves is always this: everyone gets nerves, but what makes you into a really good player is knowing how to play through those nerves. I personally don't shake much, but my breathing gets shallow, and I notice my mind starts to wander and worry about missing. What keeps me grounded is repeating thoughts like "I could miss, or I could also just FC" or to remind myself to stay focused on the main mechanics of my body. Don't lose your reading and listening, and keep your hands as loose as possible.

What are your thoughts on lazer?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

At first, I was really apprehensive, but I've gotten a little more comfortable with osu!lazer now. I still think there are a lot of pros and cons, and the general opinion is pretty mixed. As a competitive player, I think gameplay on lazer is starting to feel much smoother and more comfortable... only after I spent a couple days shuffling through the frame settings and the different render settings.

There's also a lot of missing features, like not being able to know what skin I'm using until I'm in a map, MP links being really weird for tournaments, and not being able to hide the scoreboard when playing multiplayer, which is pretty distracting. I also think lazer has awesome features and they're always adding cool things, however the UI feels very crowded, and I'd have to often ask where things are and how to find certain settings. Totally something you can get used to as a new player fresh in to lazer, but it can be pretty overwhelming for someone like me.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

If there's an ELO matchmaking system added later, would you grind it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

Maybe! I know there's been systems like that before like Maidbot which I used and was pretty cool at the time, but I'm not sure how much incentive it has to get people to grind it. There's only so many times I can play the same pools over and over again at least... but there's actually a pretty cool osu! ELO system I heard of called the osu! Performance Ranking! (please don't silence me)

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What other games besides osu! have you played the most?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

I think the games I have with the most hours are Archeage and Smite (unfortunately). I used to be a pretty big MMO player when I was younger, starting with Maplestory. Not really grinding or anything but just chill progression and exploring. That's also why one of my favourite games of all time has been Skyrim, which I've been playing since its release!

I think I played Smite heavily for about two years, again not really competitively, but I liked the gameplay a lot. I have pretty much never been competitive in a game besides osu!, probably because I can't stand random people yelling at me U_U

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What is the most memorable/impressive score in osu! to you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

I still think my most impressive score is [Euphoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1320470143). I feel like that score was pretty ahead of my time, and also the first 1000PP hidden score, which was a huge achievement! I still have the same shorts I wore that day, now dubbed the "euphoria shorts".

What goals in osu! do you have that you would like to achieve in the future?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/xootynator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598">xootynator</a></p>

I still have some dream scores I'd like to do, like finishing all my FC's on the Because Maybe's, maybe a cheeky HDHR FC on Sound Chimera, Euphoria, and Firelight... amongst some other goals. Competitively, I'd still like an international 1v1 badge, and to continue trying and supporting new and innovative ideas, like the recent Lazer Grand Arena tournament!

I hope to continue doing my best with osu! and with content creation, and I hope I can contribute more to the game as time goes on. One of my favourite contributions has been the tournament I co-host with [Fulserish](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14252162), dubbed "[Battle of the Box](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1862856)", which encouraged a lot of artists in the community to contribute to tournaments, which I think had a domino effect where many more tournaments are featuring custom artwork for custom maps! If you would like to get involved in that, please consider joining the [osu! Artist Hub](https://discord.gg/KVPDmKAkjV) Discord, where there are a lot of like-minded individuals who want to be better artists and continue contributing to the game.

Besides that, I'm very grateful to be interviewed by The Followpoint, and thank you MegaMix for all your hard work, and to the other staff of osu! that keep the game running smoothly!
