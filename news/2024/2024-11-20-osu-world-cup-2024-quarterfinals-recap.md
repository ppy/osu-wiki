Another week has passed and another elimination round is over. Read on for the most exciting matchups, the teams leaving the world cup stage, and where the pick'ems crumbled.

The team count is dwindling rapidly, having now been halved to just 12! As the remaining teams are preparing for this week's Semifinals, you can take this time to catch up on (or reaffirm) your world cup lore.

If you don't feel like reading on, or prefer digesting lore with visuals, [Junihuhn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4182339) is here to help.

For the first time this year, the pool was expanded quite a bit, with all mods receiving 1 more pick! This means the mappoolers had more chances to isolate specific skill sets, and allow for more specialised players to shine! Alongside the expansions, the pool continues to be populated with throwbacks, the big, black elephant in the room being the first thing to address. Yes, that is [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)'s original, iconic map of [The Big Black](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41823#osu/131891) in our Free Mod pool. Unsuprisingly, it was picked or banned in over half of the matches this round.

Next up we have [Frostmourne](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/199669)'s iconic 2014 map of [IGNITE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/209170/#osu/492285), offering that classic DT aim and tapping challenge old-timers know and love. [CXu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/84841)'s take on the full version of [Wing my Way](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/850548/#osu/1778268) also made its appearance as DT2, offering a tough aim flow challenge that will reward consistency the most.

Switching the topic to brand-new maps, last week was the debut of a couple of them. For those who take pride in shredding long streams, [Rebuilding](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278182#osu/4855537), the stamina and stream aim test mapped by [iamtickrate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10772580) will become an easy favourite. For the tech spaghetti enjoyers, [Azrulk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046612)'s and [Ishtiaq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6405262)'s collaboration on [It's Our Destiny (Cuepric Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278186#osu/4855557) offers a great deal of slider tech. Last, but not least, [KnightC0re](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7894340)'s [Coffee no Aji to](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278079#osu/4855234) reading pick is exactly what the average player's nightmares are made of — high density, low AR, and plenty of overlapping objects.

...oh, [and the writer of this section made a map too](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278205#osu/4855591)...

For our tiebreaker this week, we once again had a brand-new, jamming [original](/wiki/osu!_originals) unveiled. [Whiteout](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278209#osu/4855599) by [Genkaku Aria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/358) features wonderful vocals by [KOKOMI](https://twitter.com/asriel_koko), and has been adapted into a fast-paced alt and aim test by [KKipalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6889573) and [Icekalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5410645). It ended up being played in a nail-biter of a [match between the Philippines and Ukraine](#philippines-vs.--ukraine), which included a fittingly close finish.

This time, we've asked Genkaku Aria for their thoughts behind this song and about project in general:

I'm very grateful to all the members who were involved in this project. All of the project members valued the worldview of the song and gave their best performance. The design, maps, video, etc. are all of high quality.

When creating the music for OWC, I placed importance on a sense of speed and the number of notes. I hope you enjoy the cold, sad, and beautiful worldview. If you haven't seen the work yet, please check it out.

I'd like to thank the osu! management for giving me this opportunity.

24 teams were whittled down to a mere 12 in this first shakedown week of the osu! World Cup, where the contenders sought to elevate themselves above the pretenders. Teams entering this stage in the losers' bracket were now forced to play two matches per week to stave off elimination.

In retrospect, the weekend went on to become in large part a showcase of the best teams flexing their muscles. The top seeds ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea and ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia annihilated their opposition in their advance to the Semifinals, while team ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany continued its historical dominance over ::{ flag=RU }:: Russia, bringing their head-to-head matchup to 7–0 over the course of World Cup history.

Meanwhile, the North American standoff ended up in a 6–2 win for the ::{ flag=US }:: United States. This rematch of their 2023 Quarterfinals bout, in which ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada pulled off one of the largest upsets in recent world cup memory, was still very close despite the misleading scoreline. The last two points were won by a combined margin of only 150,000 points, as ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada battled to the bitter end.

For the first round of losers' bracket matches, it would be ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine to pull off the only upset of the week, as far as pick'ems were concerned. After defeating ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil 6–1 despite spectators favouring them 7:3, it turned out the country that doesn't care about the odds has an osu! World Cup team to match. They would go on to end their run against the ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines, but not without showing us the undisputed match of the week — read on for a full analysis [further below](#philippines-vs.--ukraine).

In the second losers' bracket round last weekend, there were again no pick'em surprises, but the winners all stood out for their own reasons:

- ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland's 6–0 win against ::{ flag=TR }:: Türkiye completed their perfect 12–0 weekend, bouncing back from their singular point loss so far and securing a spot in the top 12, all despite having replaced over half of their 2023 roster.
- ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile took down ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden 6–1 and look to be rounding into form as they seek to live up to expectations as the #7 seed.
- ::{ flag=CN }:: China, running back a core roster that continues to stand the test of time, swept ::{ flag=NO }:: Norway 6–0 in a surprising outcome that was truly closer than the scoreline indicated.

After all is said and done, it is with great respect that we bid adieu to ::{ flag=TR }:: Türkiye for achieving their best world cup finish ever along with ::{ flag=NO }:: Norway, ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden and ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine at 13th–16th, as well as ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil, ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland, ::{ flag=FR }:: France, ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia, ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan, ::{ flag=RO }:: Romania, ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand and ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan for finishing their 2024 campaigns in the top 24.

The best match of the Quarterfinals may have been one you didn't even know about or watch. With three matches all happening at once, ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines (seed #9) vs. ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine (seed #22), drew the short straw of not being streamed on the official Twitch channels. As it happened, this unofficial stream would include the only tiebreaker match of the weekend.

Both teams had similar strengths yet different weaknesses coming into this match, resulting in a back-and-forth slugfest. The ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines opened with [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2072797#osu/4419768) as their first pick, but ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine took it as a break point to start the match, consolidating with their own [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/209170#osu/492285) first pick. The ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines tried switching gears to [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278186#osu/4855557), but with three scores above 700,000, ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine ended up with 2 break points for a 3–0 lead.

Momentum quickly shifted with ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine's next pick, the breakcore-style speed [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278184#osu/4855553). The ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines took this map, won their own next [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278079#osu/4855234) pick with a whopping 905,684 coming from ::{ flag=PH }:: [Rammu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10652837), and stole ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine's HR2 pick afterwards with a carry performance of 839,244 from ::{ flag=PH }:: [zonelouise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1492995), tying the match 3–3.

Another two very close break points followed on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1381824#osu/3004925) and [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278182#osu/4855537) with very close 200,000 score differences on both maps, bringing the match to 4–4. Both teams had saved a good last pick for this moment, with the ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines picking [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2020320#osu/4207467), the AR 5 reading pick, and ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine picking [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/908811#osu/1896581), the flow alt tech hybrid map. With the teams tied 5–5, the only tiebreaker of the Quarterfinals weekend was secured.

Both these teams had something to prove going into this tiebreaker — the ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines and ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine both lost at least one key team member from last year, with [enri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8640970) and [hyeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976) leaving the ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines and [dench](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10073635) leaving ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine. Repeating or going beyond their final placement last year would mean that these teams can hold their own year to year regardless of roster changes.

With motivation pushing from behind and pressure mounting from above, the ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines and ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine loaded into [Whiteout](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278209#osu/4855599) for one last bout. It ended up being a battle of carry players as ::{ flag=PH }:: [NathanRam1918](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4734703) and ::{ flag=UA }:: [RafGPio](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13705417) found big combos at different points, but in the end, victory was attained by the ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines in one of the closest maps of the match — a 56,475 score difference.
