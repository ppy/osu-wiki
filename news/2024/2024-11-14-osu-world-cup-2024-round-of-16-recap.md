This past weekend marked the start of the first elimination round, and ended with eight fewer teams competing for the main prize. The show must go on though, so let's jump right into the Round of 16 recap!

Just like last time, you can also check out the high-effort video coverage by [Junihuhn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4182339) below!

This week's mappool had a unique twist, with some of the picks being throwbacks to world cups of the past! [ChaiN De/structioN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/49071/#osu/154165) mapped by [Shiirn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465126) (DT2) and [bmin11](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/43468)'s [Silent Voyage to Eternity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/14309/#osu/115384) (FM2) sparked nostalgia for many of the older players, with *ChaiN De/structioN* getting pooled for the first time since 2012's [OWC #3](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/3), challenging players with sheer speed and a focus on bursts.

*Silent Voyage to Eternity*, meanwhile, was last seen in [OWC 2016](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2016)'s Finals stage as a Hidden pick. It served as both a testament to how much players have improved since then, and a reminder that some old, remarkable scores by Chinese legend [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717) still very much [stand the test of time](/wiki/shared/news/2024-11-14-osu-world-cup-2024-round-of-16-recap/rustbell-old-score.jpg).

Going back to the present times, we had some awesome custom maps in the pool last week. [Lasse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613)'s map of [CLIMAX BREAKER!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274927#osu/4847505) (FM1) focused on anti-jumps; [Yamiaka Steroid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274939#osu/4847519) mapped by [vetoed](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10909373) (NM4) worked as the pool's de facto reading pick with lots of jumpy and overlapping patterns; and [Selnfra](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274929#osu/4847509) mapped by [Mattay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9748303) (NM2) served as a unique No Mod pick that focused on small circles and fast snaps.

We also had an [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) outside the tiebreaker slot: [Future Witness](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/444)'s energetic hardstyle song [Resolution](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274925#osu/4847498) was mapped by [Megafan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6632605) as an intense challenge of slider aim and technical streams in our Hard Rock pool.

This week's tiebreaker, [AJITAMA Adventure OST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274953#osu/4847546) by [Umeboshi Chazuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/98), caught the eyes of many with indubitable craftsmanship.

</div>

In between the usual love and care put into every song with original artwork and storyboarding, the visuals also presented plenty of lore to discover through dialogue and other small details. With an original conception by [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) and finer additions by [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718), the narrative strides from them both polished this osu! original into a fine piece of art. This time we've asked Azer to share some insight into how it was made:

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

[AJITAMA Adventure OST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274953#osu/4847546) was created with a specific vision in mind. [Umeboshi Chazuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/98) has great proficiency in expressing musical stories through their music, and I wanted to capture this idea in a way that suits an OWC tiebreaker.

The storyboard represents a short RPG adventure featuring two of Umeboshi Chazuke's recurring characters, the puppy and the bear. Thanks to [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) (who has contributed many special touches in osu! originals), the decision to represent characters as OWC staff was quickly done a day before release, with contributions between myself, [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9501251), mangomizer, [Librarian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084) & [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133).

Referenced by name in the storyboard are Leo the Civilian ([LeoFLT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3668779)), Evil King Dada ([Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119507)) & Princess Chiverly ([chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656)), three of the hardest working people behind the scenes, ensuring every osu! World Cup runs smoothly. We expanded on this idea significantly by creating special dialogue between the characters making plenty of references to OWC, other staff members & random other prominent things in osu!.

Personally, I think a large amount of staff members that are vital to the success of our event don't really get a lot of public exposure/appreciation, and while we have some other smaller ways to fit those people in somewhere, this was a golden opportunity to immortalize them into a product that they've spent so much passion and effort into. I would particularly like to thank [VenerableNyanta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12243368) for going through the extra effort of adding our silly jokes and references quickly, and I'm very happy that it was well received! Thank you all for showing appreciation for this storyboard.

The Round of 16 weekend has been jam-packed full of exciting matches, with teams both fighting for their survival, and trying to keep the coveted winners' bracket spots. Unfortunately, the following teams have been eliminated, and we have to bid them farewell from the world cup stage: ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina, ::{ flag=AT }:: Austria, ::{ flag=BY }:: Belarus, ::{ flag=KZ }:: Kazakhstan, ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia, ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru, ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore, and ::{ flag=ES }:: Spain.

Over on the winners' bracket, we can see that it's been purged of everything but the elite, with the top 10 seeds completely occupying the remaining spots. As those spots continue to be halved each week, we can look forward to some great matches coming from these titans as they fight each other for supremacy in the upcoming Quarterfinals this weekend!

Speaking of the top 10 seeds matching up, we got to see a glimpse of what those matches will look like with ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile (#7) vs. ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom (#10), a match that garnered uncertainty in regard to its results with a 34/67 split in favour of the United Kingdom on the [pick'em](https://pickem.hwc.hr/tournaments/158) votings. The match was filled with break points, but in the end, the United Kingdom pulled through, did not ruin people's pick'ems, and got away with a score of 5–3.

Continuing on with the pick'ems, the community had clear expectations in general, with no major upsets swindling players from their points. The matches of ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore (#28) vs. ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand (#21) and ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong (#8) vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines (#9) ended in decisive scores of 5–2 and 5–1 respectively, despite the community appraising an almost even 50/50 split on both of them.

However, let's not dawdle any further, and instead move onto the highlight matches of the week!

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

</div>

Heading into the week, many a sharp eye was turned to the winners' bracket matchup between the Russian Federation and China. For Russia, it was an opportunity to reach the Quarterfinals for the fourth year in a row; meanwhile, China was looking to turn the tables on old foe Russia, who swept them 5-0 back in 2021, to reach the Quarterfinals for the first time since 2020.

Both teams came out of the gates firing on all cylinders; China's first pick of [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1778687#osu/3642792) showcased one of the closest maps of the entire match, tightly contested all the way en route to a last-second China win by 42,537 points. Unfazed, Russia picked into their strength in the speed skill set, locking in [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/49071#osu/154165) for a comfortable win. China backed up their DT3 win with a dominating performance on their second pick, [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739433#osu/3555094), winning by over a million points and making the score 2–1 in their favour.

The first break point would come from a surprising source: Russia picked the tapping-focused FM3 map, but they stumbled badly, something that China took advantage of as ::{ flag=CN }:: [lolol233](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11375105) led the way to a win and a 3–1 lead. Their advantage would be short-lived, as China faltered on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274929#osu/4847509), followed by another massive Russian win on their own [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274925#osu/4847498) pick to tie the match at 3 points apiece, leaving each team with one pick.

China selected the remaining Hidden map for their last pick ([HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2009101#osu/4179715)), but it backfired in the worst possible way as Russia won in dominant fashion to earn a match point at 4–3. For their final pick, Russia selected [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1126545#osu/2353845), and what ensued was a nail-biter. Seconds counted down as Russia's combo crept up on China's lead, yet time ran out, with China pulling through and forcing the tiebreaker.

Tiebreakers have long been a sore spot for Russia. They were eliminated from each of the last three World Cup iterations via tiebreaker (and in fact hadn't won a tiebreaker **since 2011**), so they had to break their streak of tiebreaker losses to continue in the winners' bracket. As a battle raged on in [AJITAMA Adventure OST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274953#osu/4847546)'s storyboard, another one also raged between the two teams. When the dust finally settled, it was Russia that emerged victorious by a margin of just 102,726 points. With their spot in the Quarterfinals secured, the Russian roster could breathe a sigh of relief.

### ::{ flag=ES }:: Spain vs. ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland

</div>

Spain vs. Finland ended up being the star match in the losers' bracket last weekend — the only other match besides Russia vs. China that went down to the wire. The matchup was on an even playing field with both seed and skill considered, which made for an extremely exciting match where only one pick brought a decisive victory with an 800k-point difference for team Spain on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274931#osu/4847511).

Both teams were extremely confident in their strategies, which led to a match where zero break points occurred; the closest to one was team Finland's [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2009101#osu/4179715) pick, ending with a razor-thin 71k difference between both teams. Some standout carry performances included ::{ flag=FI }:: [shdewz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10000899)'s 5x100 No Mod FC on [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/14309#osu/115384), and ::{ flag=ES }:: [creator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13962152)'s FC on [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1739433#osu/3555094) and near-FC on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274925#osu/4847498) that secured the tiebreaker for team Spain.

Quite a bit was riding on this match for both teams: Spain hadn't won an OWC match since 2016 (in fact, this was their best scoreline since 2018's Group Stage), while Finland hadn't missed a Quarterfinals weekend in OWC since 2019. Unfortunately for Spain, this Cinderella comeback story was not meant to be, as they fell to Finland on the tiebreaker by 90k points. However, Spain has definitely proved themselves to be a capable contender in future World Cups — keep an eye out for them!

## Commentating throughout the years

::{#doomsday}::

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-11-14-osu-world-cup-2024-round-of-16-recap/doomsday.png)

If you stuck around the osu! community for any length of time throughout osu!'s existence, you will be aware of who [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983) is. Top player, content creator, contributor, tournament player, commentator — they've done it all throughout their 16 years as a community member.

As their 10-year anniversary as a commentator for the world cups is closing in, it's only fair to check out how they feel about the changes in the world cup throughout the years, talk about some cherished moments, and maybe even get some hot predictions regarding this year's winning team.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

As someone who has participated in OWC for 10 years now either as a player or a commentator, what are the biggest changes that stuck around in your mind even after your extended tenure?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Doomsday.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983">Doomsday</a></p>

The two biggest changes introduced from OWC 2019 come to mind. The removal of the Group Stage was one. I get why the tournament moved away from groups, but I have a real soft spot for them. The tension of close groups, where an individual map win can be the difference between qualifying or not, is something that is lost in the current format.

The other one was the long-awaited ditching of the rule of failed scores not counting, and that was massive. Trust me, OWC players don't need the stress of getting 0 score if they flop on one stream at the end. It was fun to watch, but not so much to play, and it changed the way teams picked maps. Once failed scores counted, teams didn't have to worry about playing it safe with picks, and mappoolers didn't have to worry about that either (not that it stopped them pooling [Dopamine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210316#osu/494818) in 2016 though, but you know).

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

You casted *a lot* of matches in these 10 years, but is there one match that will forever remain ingrained in your memories, and if so, what made it special to you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Doomsday.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983">Doomsday</a></p>

I'm gonna give the cop-out answer and give you two matches. The game that comes to mind has to be the OWC 2017 winner's bracket final, between Poland and the United States. It was (and still is) the most unexpected, ludicrous comeback I've seen in the world cup. Sure, the rule of failed scores not counting did add to the drama, but it made every map in the second half of that game a real nail-biter as a spectator. Capping it off with [Tengaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/336414#osu/816327) as the tiebreaker, arguably the most infamous boss map at the time, was the icing on the cake.

For the sentiment though, it has to be the most recent COE 2024 tournament in the Netherlands, where I had the honour of casting the final with [SadShiba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10747626). It's hard to describe how incredible it was to cast a top-level match between [Maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) and [Criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659), with a packed and energetic crowd in front of you reacting in real time. That was something I won't forget in a hurry.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

Finally, what are your OWC predictions for this year — anyone in specific that you are rooting for besides the home country?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Doomsday.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983">Doomsday</a></p>

Aside from the UK crew, I'm good friends with many members of team Norway, so I'd love to see them have a great run this year. Other than that, I'm always rooting for the underdog, and I want to see teams get their best runs to date. We had Peru and Belarus qualify for the Round of 32 for the first time, Spain got pretty close to their first victory in many years vs Finland, and Turkey can have their best run ever if they win vs Taiwan. I gotta root for that.

As for who's taking the title? It's hard to argue against the USA keeping their streak of championships going, but it feels like that position gets more precarious each year. South Korea and Australia are making a strong case for themselves to take that crown. That said, don't count the Brits out just yet, eh?
