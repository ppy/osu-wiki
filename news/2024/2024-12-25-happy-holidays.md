We hope you're having a cozy time with friends or family, wherever you are. Here's a few goodies we've prepared for the holidays:

## Festive client theme

Just last thursday, we kicked off the holiday season by turning on the client's festive mode, accompanied by a brand-new song from our resident osu!musician [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/1)! For osu!(lazer) specifically, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) have worked on some new bells and whistles to light up the menu:

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/2024-12-24-client-theme.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

A new festive season means new artworks on the main menu, but while [this winter's art contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/226) is still in its [voting phase](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-12-23-midnight-moment-art-contest-voting), the finalist artworks from [winter 2019](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2019-12-10-winter-is-here) return for the interim.

If your holiday schedule includes mapping but you're a bit short on fitting music, we've got you covered. Here's the (technically) last Featured Artist song release of this year!

## New medals

You might remember [last year's batch of new medals](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-12-24-new-year-2024-countdown-medals) (and [the singular one for Valentine's Day](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-02-14-project-loved-february-2024)). It's been too long (and it won't be that long in the future).

In order to make up for the long hiatus, we're dropping a fresh batch of medals totalling **14** of them for you to collect! Featuring **9** [Hush-Hush](/wiki/Medals#hush-hush) medals, **3** new [Daily Challenge](/wiki/Gameplay/Daily_challenge) milestone medals, and **2** new [Mod Introduction](/wiki/Medals#mod-introduction) medals, you'll sure have plenty to do over the holidays!

In case you've never checked out these trinkets before, they're collectibles that unlock after clearing a certain task. You'll find instructions on how to unlock these medals by hovering over them on your profile page. For the purple ones, there will only be hints to the actual solutions, but we encourage you to work together with friends to find them!

With the aging infrastructure of the osu!(stable) medal system, we've decided to make some medals that are **exclusive to osu!(lazer)**, where there's a ton more room to make them more interesting, be it with the bigger set of mods, support for other gameplay areas like multiplayer, or any future additions to the game. That said, whenever possible, new medals will still be available on both clients.

Speaking of multiplayer, we've already included a fun Hush-Hush medal that's multiplayer-oriented, a first of many to come.

By our estimates, many of these should be relatively easier (to figure out) this time around. It might also be timely to mention that there may be a certain reason to revisit the previous batch of medals. Good luck!

While this isn't quite the last news post of the year, we want to thank you for all the memories in 2024!
