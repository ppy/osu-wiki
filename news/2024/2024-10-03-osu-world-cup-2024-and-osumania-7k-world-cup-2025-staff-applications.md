As with every year, we are looking to recruit talented individuals from the community to help us make the osu! World Cup project a success. This time around, we are looking for both playtesters and referees.

### osu!mania 7K World Cup 2025 playtester

Playtesters will be responsible for playing and giving feedback for a plethora of beatmaps (as requested by the mappooling team) to gauge aspects such as difficulty, suitability for a certain slot, and/or skill representativity among others (specific workflows vary for each team). Playtesters are generally expected to have considerable skill on their respective game mode.

### osu! World Cup 2024 referee

Referees will be in charge of coordinating both qualifier and bracket stage matches, keeping track of picks and bans, and ensuring teams are respecting the rules. Referees are expected to have experience across many tournaments, irrespective of game mode. Availability to help in other osu! World Cups is a definite plus.

**Please note that if you are accepted into either team, you will not be eligible to participate as a player in that tournament.**

The World Cup team will forever be grateful for your future contributions to the project!
