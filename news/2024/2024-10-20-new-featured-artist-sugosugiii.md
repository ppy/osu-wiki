At long last, osu!'s Featured Artist library is finally home to **sugosugiii**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/442/header.jpg)

Since starting to produce music in 2015, **sugosugiii** has made a name for themselves through *BMS OF FIGHTERS* events, winning 2nd place in HoYoLAB's "Season of Creativity" competition, and events like our own community's *4K Korean Mania Tournament 2*. Now, **sugosugiii**'s legacy is part of osu!'s [official music library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) too.

What can you do with this info? [**sugosugiii**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/442) has  **8** songs pre-timed and ready for mapping. So you should do that.

Anyone who played today's [daily challenge](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-25-introducing-daily-challenges) should know **sugosugiii** by now:

Let's face it: [**sugosugiii**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/442) is right in front of you, yet you're reading this news article. You should be mapping instead.

(And of course, the rest of **sugosugiii**'s tracks are on [their listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/442) too.)

That hint about a J-Rock artist at the end of [a previous Featured Artist announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-09-28-new-featured-artist-raytrax-music-collective) is finally coming to next week (for real this time).

Stay tuned.
