Think you have what it takes to be showcased like the mappers above? This month's contest is your chance to prove it.

## Game modes

This month's contest is open to **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch** mappers.

- [osu!taiko contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/206)
- [osu!catch contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/207)

Hibernate for a month if you're an osu! or osu!mania mapper!

## Timeline

- **[Beatmapping](#beatmapping) (3 weeks):** Contest is announced and beatmappers create their entries.
- **[Screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) (1.5 weeks):** Entries are evaluated by experienced beatmappers. If there aren't many entries, this will be skipped in favour of a longer judging period.
- **[Judging](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) (1.5 weeks):** Top entries from screening are judged in detail by a different crew of experienced beatmappers.
- **[Rewards](#rewards) (~2 months from now):** Winners are announced at the start of another MBC.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

A contest with this frequency needs some spice, which is what **limitations** aim to add.

These are basically "rules" about how you should create your map for this contest, similar to a game jam's prompt or theme.

If you're confused about how these work, feel free to ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [Kimitakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4741164) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

Moving away from thematic restrictions, this month's osu!taiko limitation is simple: **the first note after any slider velocity change must be a Kat.**

...Or in simpler terms: **only change slider velocity on blue notes.**

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-03-23-monthly-beatmapping-contest-march-2024/taiko.png)

As with any limitation, your goal should be to try to use this restriction creatively. That means if you choose to make a map without slider velocity changes, you're probably not going to score too highly.

#### osu!catch

This month's osu!catch limitation: **circles (a.k.a. [fruits](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch#fruits)) are not allowed.**

You'll be creating a map entirely with [fruit trails](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch#fruit-trails) (a.k.a. sliders) and [bananas](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch#bananas) (a.k.a. spinners).

If you're feeling bold, this means you can even make a map out of a single absurdly long slider. Best of luck.

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!taiko:** the first note after any slider velocity change must be a Kat.
  - **osu!catch:** map must only use sliders (a.k.a. [fruit trails](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch#fruit-trails)) and spinners (a.k.a. [bananas](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch#bananas))
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
