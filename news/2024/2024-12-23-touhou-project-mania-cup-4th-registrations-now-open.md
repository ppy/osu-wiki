With the celebration of the Touhou Project's 30th birthday, the Touhou Project Mania Cup is returning for its 4th iteration, bringing tons of improvement in competitiveness and player enjoyment!

The [Touhou Project Mania Cup 4th](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2015815), or THMC 4 for short, is a team-based osu!mania 4K tournament exclusively featuring Touhou-related songs. This tournament aims to provide top-tier competition to the tournament scene.

We've had 80 teams [last year](/wiki/Tournaments/TMC/3rd), where team **Bloxy cola** reached the top with an undefeated performance. [This year](/wiki/Tournaments/TMC/4th), with more teams joining the competition, which team will rise to the challenge and become the best?

## What's new

- **A Group Stage will be introduced this year**.
  - If there are fewer than 70 teams playing in the Qualifier, the Group Stage will use the standard double-elimination format, featuring 8 groups of 4 teams each.
  - If there are 70-140 teams playing the Qualifier, the Group Stage will use the split [double-elimination format](/wiki/Tournaments/TMC/4th#Group-Stage-&-Playoffs), featuring 16 groups of 4 teams each. This means that we will have **64 teams** in the main event.
  - More large-scale announcements will be made if more than 140 teams played the Qualifier!

  - **Each team will have 2 bans for matches played using the group stage mappools**, providing extra strategic options throughout the different weeks.
- **A special series of "X" picks will apply for RC and LN slots**, giving players more options to pick harder charts.
- Two teams from each group will advance; all advanced teams will compete in a standard double-elimination bracket for the championship.

## Custom maps

With nearly **50 custom mappers** contributing, this year we are bringing you mappools that are **almost entirely custom-made** with maps ranging from the lower end of the difficulty spectrum to the very top. We hope this will not only enhance our Touhou journey but also contribute to the osu! community by adding more Touhou maps!

You can check out [Supa7onyz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/435)'s brilliant Grand Finals custom tiebreaker song from last year as an example:
