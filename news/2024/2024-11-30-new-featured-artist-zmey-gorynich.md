A new species of metal music crawled into our Featured Artist library, courtesy of **Zmey Gorynich**!

Self-proclaimed "buffoons", Russian band **Zmey Gorynich** made a name for itself by playing an unusual combo of cheerful extreme metal since 2012. They were brought to the forefront of osu! by metal mastermind [Mazzerin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2942381) with [Sorochinskaya Yarmarka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1191853), a stream map featuring unreal slider-centric design perfectly fitting the insanity of the tune.

A grand total of **8** aural gems have been put on display in [**Zmey Gorynich**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/450). Use the pre-timed beatmap templates while you can (which will be forever).

Words aren't very good at describing music. osu! gameplay does a better job:

If you're looking for more tracks (which you obviously are), [**Zmey Gorynich**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/450) has pre-timed map templates for everything osu! has to offer. Do what needs to be done.

Look forward to a technical music reveal next weekend. As with most of our hints, we mean that in the most misleading way possible.

Stay tuned.
