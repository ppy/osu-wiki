Embrace the cozy vibes of autumn and let your creativity shine in the Autumn 2024 Fanart Contest!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/221/banner.jpg)

For the first time ever (somehow), the osu! mascots are ready to take on the autumn season! The leaves are falling, the air is crisp, and the pumpkins are ripe for the carving. It's time to let your creativity run wild and show us what the osu! mascots are up to in this cozy season!

Warm up your tablets and pens, and get ready to...

**Draw any of the osu! (or community) mascots in autumn-themed scenarios!**

In case you're still lost in the groove, here are some examples to take inspiration from:

- pippi and Yuzu having a picnic under a tree surrounded with yellow, orange and red fauna.
- Mocha sipping on some hot mocha while watching the leaves fall in a serene park.
- Chirou and Mani having a friendly leaf fight in the midst of cleaning up a garden.
- Tama and Alisa enjoying a cozy evening by a bonfire, roasting marshmallows. Or doing homework.
- Aiko strolling the evening streets back home from school, in the autumn rain.
- The osu! cast exploring a pumpkin patch, with Mari trying to find the biggest pumpkin to carve for Halloween.
- ...or basically anything you can think of that involves some sort of autumnal setting!

If you read all that and find yourself surprised, you might be a veteran in these contests. That's because this is the first time this season's theme doesn't revolve around Halloween, which means tranquility and rest time for our mascots following their [sky-bound adventures in the last contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results). Mild mischief might work, but anything frightful will have missed the mark.

## Rewards

As tradition dictates, a selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu** and receive **3 months of osu!supporter**, plus the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations.

Let's not also forget about the top 3 finalists being available for everyone as a [**limited-time selection of default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations)! Be sure to look into the current fanart banner roster before they disappear forever!

## Rules

Like any contest, this one has rules. We advise you to read through them even if you've participated before.

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Autumn 2024 Fanart Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it's your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** Otherwise, the Dean "peppy" Herbert will hold your fate for eternal judgement, and oh he may not be so merciful...
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** The autumn season is a time of warmth and comfort — let's keep it that way!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw or trace someone else's work.
- **Generative art programs or methods (such as AI) are not allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We will know if you do this. If we somehow miss it, the community won't. Don't sully your legacy as an artist!
- **Participants must keep a full file containing all of their entry's layers available.** We'll only ask you for this if we think it's needed to ascertain any claims regarding plagiarism or the use of generative art tools. If you don't/can't provide us this within a timely manner when we ask, we'll have no choice but to pull your listing from the contest, sorry!
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to any corner of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536**. This is automatically checked via the website, and the contest listing won't let you submit an entry even if it's off by ONE pixel. Export your creations at the correct resolution!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** The circular spot in the middle shows where the main-menu cookie will be when inside the game. Factor this in when designing your piece, as anything inside it is likely not going to be seen. This doesn't mean leaving a big circular hole full of nothing in the middle! Be creative. *Make sure you don't leave it visible in your end result.*
- **Do NOT leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.** We had such a good streak last time... Let's not ruin it again.
- **If you're using characters from other intellectual properties, do so sparingly.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using excessive representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work — the contest is about osu! foremost, after all. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Got any questions, or any urgent matters that need to be looked at? Don't hesitate to [send Hivie a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) for any inquiries regarding this contest!

Alright, what are you waiting for? Head over to the [Autumn 2024 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/221) once you've finished cooking your masterpiece and drop it in there. You may reupload your entry to your heart's content if you want to make any adjustments, but you only have **20 days** to do so before the doors close off forever, so don't brood over which mascot to draw for too long!

Good luck!

—Hivie & Walavouchey
