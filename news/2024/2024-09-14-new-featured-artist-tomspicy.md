Send only your warmest welcomes to **tomspicy**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/437/header.jpg?1)

**tomspicy** is an electronic artist whose music career was kickstarted by passionate public reception to a meme track: the "[fieryrage accordion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoV794KYq48) [hardcore remix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=%22fieryrage%20accordion%22)".

Ever since the short tune's release in 2021, **tomspicy** has been dedicated to electronic music, primarily outputting drum and bass with occasional dips into other electronic subgenres like hardcore and old school jungle. As of today, **tomspicy** is also dipping into our Featured Artist library!

**16** tunes available on [**tomspicy**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/437), including an extended version of the fieryrage accordion hardcore remix and three new [original songs](/wiki/osu!_originals) produced specifically for this Featured Artist reveal!

Every track above, plus at least eleven more are now (and until the end of time) available on [**tomspicy**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/437). Get them before they're gone (which, again, is the end of time).

Another Featured Artist is theoretically on the docket for next week. We'll leave it to you to verify that.

Stay tuned.
