According to everyone we've asked, osu! *needs* more Touhou. **ShibayanRecords** is here to deliver.

We couldn't help but save a special Featured Artist for annual osu! day (July 27th, for the uninitiated). **ShibayanRecords** has become a household name here on osu! since practically the very beginning, so they've been on our Featured Artist radar for a *long* time. Today, they're officially part of the crew!

**21** Touhou-related tunes can be found on [**ShibayanRecords**' Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/432), each prepared as a pre-timed beatmap template. (In other words, the most tedious step of mapping is done for you!)

You might've already played iconic maps like [MyonMyonMyonMyonMyonMyon!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/426542) and [Getsurei 11.3 no Candle Magic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/122390), but if you're a background dim fiend, you might have never seen their storyboards by the legendary [11t](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2112092). Take a look at what you've been missing:

We don't need to tell you what to do. [**ShibayanRecords**' Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/432) has what you want.

If you guessed we'd be releasing another Featured Artist next week... you'd be right. It'd be a lot more surprising if we didn't have something planned.

Anyways, stay tuned!
