Hey, did you hear that? That's the sound of a new interview! Today we are joined by WhiteCat, a top player who many remember as someone who was dominating the scene, before [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902)'s rise, as a former rank #1 player!

So, let's get right to reading!

Hello, let's start with an introduction, how would you introduce yourself to people who don't know you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

Hi, I'm WhiteCat, former rank #1 osu! player, now kinda retired.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

How did you get introduced to osu! and what was your first impression of it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

I got introduced to osu! back when MCPvP disbanded, yet I really did not like it the first time I tried it. I layed off the game for roughly a year and then came back and stuck with it.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

I know many have already heard about it, but could you please tell us how did you come up with your username "WhiteCat", for people who don’t know that?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

The story begins with a neighborhood black cat who used to visit us. Took inspiration from her and wanted to name myself BlackCat. As this was taken though, I opted for WhiteCat.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Since you have some experience with leading a healthy life, do you feel like there can be a big mental and physical help by visiting a gym?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

I think there are numerous benefits to the going to the gym. I think this applies to a lot of types of exercise though, and in the end it ties back to moving your body a lot.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What would you say is the greatest gift that osu! has given you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

Probably the witchhunters. Taught me not to care and just pursue my own thing. Especially afterwards, it's interesting how life can present you something seemingly negative, just for it to turn out a stepping stone to something greater.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Have you ever experienced a time when you couldn’t play osu! mentally, and how do you deal with this feeling?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

Not sure what is meant by this. If due to bad mindset, then sure on singular days but not for longer periods. I still think mindset is everything. You at least have to have yourself on your side.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Since you haven’t been very active in osu! recently, what have you been doing in your free time?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

I've been studying and also working. Not really much free time left there.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Are you ever planning to make a face reveal?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

Probably in the future sometime. Though I have to say I have not regretted not having face revealed and I appreciate my privacy.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What other rhythm games (or osu! game modes) besides osu! have you played?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

It went like this: Geometry Dash - osu! mobile - normal osu!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Who would you say are the best osu! player(s) at the moment and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

I'm pretty out of loop currently, so I don't know a lot of the new top players. mrekk got that phenotype though.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Is there any advice that you would give to people who are just starting out?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

Enjoy game.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Will you ever attend some IRL tournaments? Like The Roundtable for example.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

Possibly, maybe even likely.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What is your favorite score that you’ve ever set and which score would be your "dream" one to set in the future?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

It is tough to choose one, yet my all time favorite might just be [revolutionary etude](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/539300#osu/1142884), just because I could have never fathomed.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Who would you want to meet IRL the most if you could meet any osu! player?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>

[Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150), always been pleasant to chat with and turns out we share quite a few interests.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

To finish things up, what does the future hold for you? Do you have anything else that you'd like to mention?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/WhiteCat.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101">WhiteCat</a></p>
