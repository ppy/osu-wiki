What better way to prepare for the New Year than sharing cozy late-night moments with friends?

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-12-03-midnight-moment-art-contest/banner.jpg)

The dawn of a New Year is calling for all osu! art extraordinaires to come together and flex their artistic prowess!

Lock in your drawing tools and get ready to...

**Draw any of the osu! (or community) mascots sharing a moment on a winter night!**

While this is our "New Year" theme, you may have correctly surmised that it's not strictly limited to the associated festivities. Any scene of candid winter night will net you points. If sunny springtime flower fields come to mind, you have travelled too far into the future.

In case you're still gathering ideas, here's a few to get the flow flowing:

- The osu! cast lit solely by the stars and flares of firework fountains.
- Mocha writing down her resolutions while pippi prepares snacks for the last movie night of the year.
- Mari and Yuzu sitting on a bridge overlooking the town, waiting for dawn.
- Mani volunteering as a DJ at Taikonator 3000's New Year's house party.
- Chirou chilling in her room (alongside a curious Don), reminiscing at a photo album of all her memories with her friends during the past year.

## Rewards

As always, a selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu** and receive **3 months of osu!supporter**, plus the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations.

In addition, the top 3 finalist artworks will be available for everyone as a [**limited-time selection of default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations)! Be sure to look into the current fanart banner roster before they disappear forever!

## Rules

Like any contest, this one has rules. You should read through them even if you've participated before.

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Midnight Moment Art Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it's your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** The mascots are not optional and neither are the New Year vibes!
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** The New Year is a time of joy and celebration — let's keep it that way!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw or trace someone else's work.
- **Generative art programs or methods (such as AI) are NOT allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We will know if you do this. If we somehow miss it, the community won't. Don't sully your legacy as an artist!
- **Participants must keep a full file containing all of their entry's layers available.** We'll only ask you for this if we think it's needed to ascertain any claims regarding plagiarism or the use of generative art tools. If you don't/can't provide us this within a timely manner when we ask, we'll have no choice but to pull your listing from the contest, sorry!
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to any corner of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536**. This is automatically checked via the website, and the contest listing won't let you submit an entry even if it's off by ONE pixel. Export your creations at the correct resolution!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** The circular spot in the middle shows where the main-menu cookie will be when inside the game. Factor this in when designing your piece, as anything inside it is likely not going to be seen. This doesn't mean leaving a big circular hole full of nothing in the middle! Be creative. *Make sure you don't leave it visible in your end result.*
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION.**
- **DO NOT LEAVE THE DOTTED osu! COOKIE TEMPLATE VISIBLE IN YOUR SUBMISSION.**
- **Do NOT leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.**
- **If you're using characters from other intellectual properties, do so sparingly.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using excessive representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work — the contest is about osu! foremost, after all. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Got any questions, or any urgent matters that need to be looked at? Don't hesitate to [send Hivie a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) for any inquiries regarding this contest!

Okay, got all that? Your next mission is to drop your masterpiece in the [Midnight Moment Art Contest Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/226) once you've finished cooking it. You may reupload your entry to your heart's content if you want to make any adjustments, but you only have until Sunday, 22 December (18:00 UTC) to do so before submissions close, so don't brood over how many fireworks you're having for too long!

Good luck!
