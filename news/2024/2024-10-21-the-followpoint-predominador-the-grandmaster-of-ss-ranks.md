Hi Predominador, thanks for joining us today! Just like in our other interviews, could you please introduce yourself for those who might not know you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

Hello! I am Predominador, from Brazil. I am an SS farmer in osu!catch, who recently reached 100k SS ranks! Besides SS, I also like to try to get some first places in songs I like (or any other good placement), and from time to time to try to get new medals, too! Since a decade ago, I have been adventuring myself in all game modes, and like to play all of them, but currently I am mostly playing only osu!catch! My favorite mods are HD and FL.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

How did you learn about osu! and was your first impression of it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

I got introduced in an anime-related page I used to follow in Facebook! They were kinda just recommending it, and somehow that caught my interest, so I downloaded the game the same day (23 June, 2014). My first impression of the game was very positive, it was full of songs I already knew, plus the challenging aspect of the game. Just this was needed to **catch** me and make me want to improve in osu! and keep playing it for a long time!

By the way, the image below is basically the exact post I found about osu!. I tried to find it again, but sadly I think the page is gone. Luckily I took a screenshot before, and saved it :D

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Out of all game modes osu! has to offer, why did you choose osu!catch?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

I ended up getting closer to osu!catch than other modes because I started to have more contact with osu!catch players in the past than other game modes. Another reason might be because it felt more interesting to me to see myself (don't take it literal, it's the catcher, actually) "moving" in the screen and not clicking the notes in timing, or trying to aim (skill issue). It's a different feeling I have compared to other modes. I guess it feels like dancing to the beat XD. By the way, I don't dance IRL, I am SUPER shy...

Anyways, even though I am playing mostly osu!catch currently, I already played quite a lot all other game modes too! Now I am playing them from time to time, but eventually I want to start playing them more often again. I'm interested in improving more in each one, not just as a general challenge, but also to have skill enough to try to get some mode-exclusive medals, hehe :p

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Who or what was your main inspiration to keep playing and improve at osu!catch?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

This is the classic answer for many players, but [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) really inspired me! He was one of the bests in many different "playstyles" of the game, like HDHRDT in AR10 map, FL in hard maps, high CS maps, high star maps, tech maps, and so on. Seeing a player like him being able to be so expert in many different ways inspired me to try my best with many different mod combinations, in different types of maps too! Even though I am not as good as he was, I feel having a "wider" skillset made me reach where I am today, and enjoy different aspects of the game. 

Also, more related to SS now, my main inspiration is [syu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2400918)! Since way before I was hard grinding to 100k SS, I've seen his pace being VERY consistent, this during months, with some rare days-off, while I was struggling to keep my own pace, with days farming a lot and in the next day(s) farming much less. But seeing him doing his best also inspired me to do my best, even through inconsistency! He is really a legend, very good player in many aspects too, and I am willing to see him reaching 100k in a soon future!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What made you decide to push for grinding SS ranks? How did you find motivation to reach such an impressive number as 100,000 SS ranks as a result?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

What made me decide to start grinding SS was basically because at some point in 2015-2017 I said a silly, sarcastic joke to some friends that I was going to try to reach 50,000 SS. It's those jokes that we say something so absurd that it's obvious that you're just trolling. But I kept getting some SS whenever possible, and since I kept making posts of every 1000 SS completed (before in Facebook, but after 50k SS just somewhere in Discord), I directly saw myself making progress little by little, so it started to look more and more possible!

Then, eventually, I reached the 50,000 SS mark (more specifically in August of 2021), which used to be my biggest long-term goal. Notice that 100k SS wasn't even in my plans. After that moment, my SS-rank quantity kept increasing as I was still playing almost everyday. Eventually, I started to consider 100,000 SS as a "new" long-term goal, and at some point, I decided that I was gonna go for it. I don't remember exactly when this happened, but I do remember  starting to grind way more in the middle of last year, leading up to September 25 of this year, when I finally completed this goal!

I'll be honest, my motivation to go this far is a bit unclear even to me. Maybe I just wanted a long-term challenge, and that joke ended up being an excuse to fulfill an unconscious desire. To stay motivated, I tried not to dwell too much on how many SS I still needed to farm to reach my goals. After every 1,000 SS completed, I focused more on what I was going to play in the next 1,000. But I also had to carefully consider what to play and use several small strategies along the way.

To keep it brief, I basically prioritized longer and harder maps when I felt up to the grind, so I would have enough easy and/or short maps to play when I wasnâ€™t performing well or was unmotivated for some reason. Even though I still had moments of stress, I think this balance was crucial to avoid getting too overwhelmed, exhausted, or ending up with only hard/long maps left to play. The main point was to keep pushing for as long as possible, doing the best I could.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

While grinding for SS ranks, did you have any struggles, and how did you manage to overcome them?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

For sure yeah. There were many days that I was either not really motivated, or feeling tired. As I mentioned before, one main thing I did was to save those easier/shorter maps to days I feel not grinding much. There were many days that was really tough, even doing this little "strategy". So, in this case, I just tried to stick to some minimum quantity I should get in the day, to guarantee some progress. In the past, it used to be 25 SS, but at some point in this year I increased it to 50 SS or even higher when I was reaching the goal. Of course, there were days that I couldn't even get the minimum, but I just accepted that and tried to compensate in some other day I was feeling stronger to grind!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Ok, and what about highlights? Did this journey have any standout moments that you'll always remember?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

Hmm I feel there are many moments I could say, but let me think... when I reached 25,000, it's exactly when I started to REALLY believe I could reach 50k, since I was halfway through, so it's very memorable for me. And of course, when I was reaching 50,000 and 100,000 SS. When I was going for 50k, it was very tough, because I didn't really planned very well the final maps, and was needing to search for anything I could SS more easily. This made me get very exhausted in that day. Due that, for 100k SS I prepared much better, saving many short Normal diffs to play in the final 1000 SS, and that made the final section much faster and less exhaustive!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

How did you feel after finally reaching this goal? Did you maybe celebrate it in any particular way?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

It was a mix of emotions, but I felt specially really relieved, because at that point I was postponing every other thing I wanted to do to avoid making it longer than it was already being (I also procrastinated a lot). Now I can continue watching Frieren \Ãµ/ (for example)!

About celebration, kinda. It didn't happen the way I planned, though. I was planning to reach it while livestreaming in a Discord call with some friends (and listening to them and chatting by text), which is something I even started to do, but the grind took longer than I expected.

When I was getting closer, it was very late night already. And I didn't want to let it to the "next day" (it was already September 25th) because, fun fact, it was also my birthday (and this really wasn't planned, in my expectations I was supposed to reach it at most around day 10 of September)! So, even my friends said to finish it, then when I wake up again I could just rest and celebrate! They followed me in the most part of the journey, though. Not just in that day, some of them follow my progress since years, and I am very grateful for that :D

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Is there any advice that you would give to other players who want to reach some long-term goal, for example specific number of SS ranks, just like you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

First of all, taking SS ranks as an example, I strongly recommend for you to set your goal, but only think about your next 1000, at most (as I mentioned I did before). Why is this important? Personally I think it's important for you to divide your big goal into small sections. That will make it look much more realistic, while focusing in what's your next steps. Also, constantly thinking about your final goal will only make you think how much you still have to do, and that can potentially more make you unmotivated than anything else. So, avoid it and focus in what's coming next.

Still taking SS ranks as an example again, the main thing to remember is that if you're going to high quantities like 50k or 100k SS, you will need to play A LOT of long maps. It's better to have that in mind since beginning, because if you only keep playing short maps, later you'll end up having only long maps, and just having long maps to play is quite overwhelming, especially because you'll see your progress going slow. It'd say the same for easy and hard maps, for sure it's much better if you have skill enough to play the hard ones, too.

If you're going for "lower quantities" (but that's still a lot) like classic 10,000 SS, you can forget anything I said in the paragraph above, and just play as short/easy maps as you can find. There is enough maps to do it, even though it will still take time.

But in any case, keep in mind that your "journey" through a long-term goal is really important, and will also take long time anyways. So make sure to avoid stressing too often over it and, in case of osu!, to have as much fun as possible. I think the most important in long-term goals is to at least have a minimum discipline to keep making progress. Don't even need to set something to do literally everyday, it can be every 3 days, or every week. And, I am not gonna lie, I procrastinated A LOT, but I kept trying to do the minimum everyday, and still reached where I am. Constancy is the word.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Now that you've reached 100,000 SS ranks, are you considering going for full completion in osu!catch?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

Unfortunately, I don't have plans to go for full completion. I got exhausted enough grinding for 100,000 SS, and going for completionist means that I would need to play way harder maps in order to accomplish to it (and not even get SS!!!), and I don't feel I have hands/arms to grind so much again (especially because I get tired quite fast)... so I feel it's more worth it if I focus in other things now. But I really really admire completionist players, and also the ones that want to be, no matter what game mode! It's a very long journey, and I know it's not easy.

BUT I have plans in going for osu!catch (only exclusive maps) completionist. It's much less maps, and feels more realistic to me. Not too soon, though. That's something for later!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Following up on the previous question, what are your thoughts on the current state of completionist badge?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

I think that the badges are really cool, it needs to be updated more frequently, though... but PERSONALLY, I feel titles are more cool in completionist cases. It's very very unique thing to do, and it just keeps getting harder and harder to complete the game, since there are maps getting ranked everyday!

But related to that, same as what to happens in [this page](/wiki/People/Completionists), I feel it would be cool to have some page in the wiki that register players that grind other things and reach specific marks too, and when. As for example SS and Ranked Score, which are some of other things that many usually grind nowadays. Who already reached 50k SS in osu!catch and WHEN did they reach it? and in osu!? osu!taiko? osu!mania? I feel those things are important not only to keep history registered, but to all players who grind other things also get recognized by their efforts too, which is usually underestimated and underappreciated.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

As an osu!catch player, what are your thoughts on lazer?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

I didn't play that much osu!catch in lazer, but I used to play in lazer to play Beatmap Spotlights, and I saw it getting better and better over time. It feels good to play now, even though I still suffer some spike lags if I don't close everything else. But this is also probably because my PC is very very old ;c

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What other games besides osu! have you played the most? Do you think any of them helped you improve at osu!catch?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Predominador.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4568537">Predominador</a></p>

Firstly, I'd like to mention Celeste, a game that helped me in a different way, which is where my profile picture comes from (the one with a red-haired girl). Along many other things, this game told me a lot about dedication, understanding and accepting more about myself to overcome problems, and not giving up easily when some part of you says you can't do it. Know your limits, and be to yourself your biggest friend, because you're already your biggest enemy. Quite contradictory, isn't it? Just know you can do it, so go and challenge yourself :D (And play Celeste.)

Now, if talking about rhythm games, when younger I used to play a lot of Guitar Hero/Guitar Flash, and more recently BanG Dream and Project Sekai. I also played a bit of Muse Dash and ADOFAI. I feel all of them kinda helped me not only in osu!catch, but any rhythm game. Even in new ones I usually have a good idea of timing and rhythm sense, plus I really enjoy rhythm games, so it's a win/win. 

Lastly, I played and play a lot of Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero. Recently I returned to play Geoguessr too, and I'm quite addicted to it. Sadly, I don't feel those helped me to improve in osu! at all... XD but it's making me relax and rest more.

What plays, be they yours or someone else's, do you find the most impressive? If you had to pick a play of your own, which ones are you really proud of?

[Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626) already mentioned it in [his interview](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-08-19-the-followpoint-motion-the-ultimate-catcher), but one of the scores I got most impressed is [Kayano Ai - Oracion (TV Size) \[Crystal's Rain\] +HDHRDT](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1930590015), by ExGon. It's one of my favorite scores, because to set a score like this you need to be absurdly great at many different aspects, such as being able to read very high AR (in this case AR11, which is AR10 + DT), having extremely good catch control, much patience, and other things.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-21-the-followpoint-predominador-the-grandmaster-of-ss-ranks/oracion.jpg)

I also want to mention a score from the osu! game mode, which is [Within Temptation - The Unforgiving \[Marathon\] with FL](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/osu/3549163348), done by [-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581). A 53-minute map that is already challenging by itself without any mods, let alone with FL. I even have no words to say how impressive this is! Dedication and patience are the words. Never ever give up.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-21-the-followpoint-predominador-the-grandmaster-of-ss-ranks/the_unforgiving.jpg)

Now, about the score I am really proud I did, I will for sure mention [Yousei Teikoku - Kyouki Chinden (TV Size) \[Hard\] with HRFL](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1930699948). The score is quite old (already from 6 years ago), but it was a challenge I did to myself, and tryhard something harder with FL. It took around 5 days and 651 attempts (not counting attempts done in practice diffs). I really really want to do some other score like this, much more challenging and unique, but still looking for something I feel having motivation to tryhard!

If you could choose any osu! player, who would you want to meet IRL the most, and why?

Wow, I'll be honest that this question is the hardest one for me! I am very shy, so I never thought so much about this. I could mention any of the close friends I have, but that would be way too easy (or too hard, because other friends not mentioned could get sad '-'). 

Anyways, I feel there are many players that would be interesting to meet IRL, I think it one obvious one would be ExGon, because I really admire him and is by far my biggest inspiration to this day! A less obvious one that I'd like to meet one day (and maybe a unexpected one, since he's not from osu!catch world) is [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691), since from time to time I enjoy watching his livestreams and YouTube videos and he's a great osu! player. He seems to be really fun! But in both cases, I would barely have the courage to even ask for a photo...

Are you planning on setting new achievements in the future, and if so, what would you like to achieve?

For now, I have 2 concrete plans: to reach 101k SS, because it means reach 100k SS Silver; and to reach 1 Trillion ranked score, which is actually something I never did grind directly, it just happened to me gaining a lot due consequences of SS farming... but I think it'd be cool to reach 1 trillion (for now just syu did it), and I am already close to do both, actually. However, for now, I am prioritizing rest.

After that, I will probably return to try to get some medals I still don't have, osu!catch exclusive maps completionist, and also improve my skill not only in osu!catch, but other game modes too. Other specific goals I will think more about in the future!

Finally, do you have anything else that youâ€™d like to mention?

I want to say that thanks to osu!, I had the opportunity to know some artists that their songs are very important to me, such as Mili, Porter Robinson, Aimer, Kenshi Yonezu, Camellia, Nekomata Master, and many others! 

Thanks to my friends and everyone that support me and have some consideration! And I hope I somehow inspired some of you to pursue your goals, or maybe even play osu!catch!

Even though we all have moments of stress and frustration here, it's always good to remember to prioritize having fun! This is a game, after all.

And thanks for the opportunity to be interviewed on The Followpoint, it was really an honor! I really hope you all enjoyed reading this interview! Now let's enjoy game Ãµ/
