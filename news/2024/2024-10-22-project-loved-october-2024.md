As Autumn descends upon our lands like the falling leaves, so does another round of Project Loved.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

It's time for another edition of Project Loved, your favourite community project where [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) submit picks, and the community has 10 days to speak their minds or hold their peace forevermore.

As always, more information is available on the [wiki](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and the [Loved website](https://loved.sh).

The keen-eyed among you might have noticed a pinned comment regarding playlists in osu!(lazer). We're happy to announce that the playlists are here to stay and will be a regular main-stay from here on out! Starting with this month's playlists, players that manage to retain a #1 position after the playlist ends (7 days after the news post goes live) will earn themselves 1 month of [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter)!

You are an amazing, dedicated player. Your love literally is as precious as a baby. I'm just gonna nominate this, and you're gonna keep coming back, I'm going to make more leaderboards, you're gonna keep coming back. Why? Cause you keep clicking the circles. You talented, unstoppable soul.

You're gonna stay on the grind until you reach the top. You serve an essential purpose in life. Your purpose is to dominate the rankings and inspire others with your passion for these beatmaps. Your purpose in life is to be in that zone daily.

Your life is everything, you serve an invaluable purpose.

You should love yourself (and this map), NOW.

Hello? Demon Aim October? Don't remember this agenda being pushed... I thought we were still on Speed September..\
We need a map for *Popular Playcounts* this month? AIM? Say less ‚Äî let's call in the avengers.

Well, avengers might be a debatable title, but it's finally time to give [All Fool](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1804676#osu/3729845) a shot for the Loved section. You're probably already familiar with this map, but multiple difficulties of practically cross-screen jumps at 195 BPM make this map feel nigh-impossible. Whether you've been an original fan of [-NeBu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4099626), a preacher of [alden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545323)'s [stream maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1779388#osu/3644151), a tournament tracker for [quantumvortex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10660777), or just in love with the rest of the unranked aim cult, there's going to be a mapper here that you'll recognise.

What are you waiting for? You're telling me you don't want to see [WhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4504101), [hyeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976), [xootynator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598), and [EIGER](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1504556) battle it out on a demonic leaderboard? Yeah... not so funny is it now... just vote YES and let the magic happen.

This month's *Outstanding oldies* is a real blast to the past, it's [Beautiful Day - Toccata & Fugue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10856#osu/47528) hosted by [DaRRi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/60294)! You might have come across their signature difficulty name "DaRRi Mix" if you've ever dug into osu!'s history.

Uploaded in November 2009, be sure to expect a grid-heavy style, classic b√©zier slider shapes and tricky cut streams to test your aim control. If you're finding it too tricky, then why not try the lower difficulties mapped by [sallad4ever](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/185422) and [ignorethis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27343)?

There's a lot of charm in maps this old, and I think *Toccata & Fugue* deserves a home in the Loved section after over 10 years in the Graveyard. Be sure to cast your vote if you think so too!

...It's a [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717) map again. Why aren't we surprised?

[Monochrome Re.Surgence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/646879#osu) is quite the experience. While most rustbell maps tend to be player favourites, this one is acclaimed by mappers, making it a very interesting *Small Spectacles* pick. It's hard to explain why the map is so special without looking at it. It's that unique and recognizable rustbell style, but on a song you usually wouldn't expect, and he makes it work. The patterns flow across the screen with their unique 1/8 and 1/12 rhythms, following the piano as wonderful vocals fill your ears with joy. Everything is complemented so well here. It's not just a beatmap, it's something else.

osu! needs more reggaeton with leaderboards.

The combo of [-Sh1n1-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1957638), [Cote](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5741153), [Gero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1467715), [Hazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4668230), [MaestroSplinter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6707918), [pkhg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/343624), [TheShadowOfDark](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5795337) and of course [Tatan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5646529) makes this is a full Latin American set. Fitting for the song, as it is played frequently all over Latin America. Unfortunately, this mapset is no longer going for Ranked, so it would definitely have a home here in Project Loved considering the 175,000+ play count and 250+ favourites.

This set is for everyone to enjoy, ranging from **1.79‚òÖ** to **5.98‚òÖ**. If you like simple maps, this is definitely the set for you, and you get to enjoy this banger of a song while playing it.

Want this map to finally get a leaderboard? Vote now!

It's a beautiful Friday afternoon and you've just gotten off of school, ready to enjoy your weekend filled with osu! tournaments and mapping drama. You come home and launch the game, only to realize that this week's DT1 for OWC 2030 is none other than... you guessed it... **class is in session**.

This month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick is none other than [Mr HeliX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2330619)'s map of [Run Lads Run](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1492125#osu/4820490). Filled with an assortment of simple mental math problems for you to solve and play, this map requires a next level of focus as you attempt to answer questions while still following the map itself. This track really requires you to read and think fast, and gamma won't be doing you any favours.

Top 50 global? Don't care. Top 3 OWC? Doesn't matter to me. As long as I'm first place on one of these difficulties... and as long as you vote YES!

Ever wanted to feel like playing osu! was like playing a course in a Sonic game? Well, we've got the map for you here in Project Loved, in this month's *Meme Monstrosities*.

[Live and Learn](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/874398#osu), mapped by [Uberzolik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1314547), [Axaptice](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4395077), [silento](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573664) and [thinking](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7642841), is a map that combines high-speed sliders with the vibe that you would get while playing *Sonic Adventure 2*, an iconic Sonic game. It is also the reason why you can no longer play warmups in tournaments! But we live and we learn, and that's a story for another time. Peaking at 11.8‚òÖ thanks to some... emotional patterns, the star rating probably isn't the only thing high in here. Who cares, SONIC4EVER!!1!

Listen, we don't have much time. This pick is hanging on the edge of tomorrow. So if you want to see this Loved, vote YEA YEA YEA!

This was up for [Project Loved: November 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-11-27-project-loved-november-2020) voting and due to the old threshold of 85% for passing, this one did not make the cut.

For this month's third Wildcard slot, here's one of osu!'s signature iconic songs, but a little bit faster.

[yaseta - Bluenation (Speed up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/877087#osu), mapped by [ViperSWC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11724519) and [BaAR_Vendel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8679346), is a map you might recognize from a lot of top players' streams around 2020. Through several attempts at mapping the same song, we see how a mapper's style evolves across the years as they grasp the fundamentals and improve their execution, that's not to say the earlier attempts aren't already extremely fun to play, though! Get ready for some rather extreme jumps and streams as you dance around the screen with this certified osu! banger.

[Matsushita - raspberry cube](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1145006#taiko/2390639) by [hoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9503098) is arguably the most played multiplayer map of all time!\
While the song is fast at 290 BPM, the map features very stress-free rhythms that help you recover from the kiai's with nice patterns that are very intuitive, as is typical of [hoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9503098)!! If you are reading this description and you are not good at speed maps, please give this one a shot. We believe it is quite valuable for practice! Also, don't forget to vote yes!

[ler1211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19901680) returns to this month's Loved voting with perhaps one of his most loved Graveyard maps out there, [YUC'e no Kusodeka Sanbai Yakuman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1733757#taiko).

This song is essentially a megamix of the best known tracks from YUC'e remixed by cexiria, which is a name you may recognise from other taiko maps. All of this is a recipe for a huge success of a map for this game mode.

Featuring great mapping from ler1211 as always, this map is packed full of amazing rhythm including many 1/6 patterns! So if you're a learning taiko player looking for some practice, or just a taiko veteran looking for a great song compilation, this is the map for you!

[\_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6170507) is a name that should need no introduction, holding rank #1 for a long time as well as creating several maps that are bound to make long-time players nostalgic. [Camellia - Blackmagik Blazing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1087782#taiko/2274690) is a blast from the past that has built up popularity since its submission just after New Year 2020. Coming in at just under 7‚òÖ and 256 BPM, [Blackmagik Blazing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1087782#taiko/2274690) includes minimal SV and offers variety and difficulty through the use of multiple snappings, patterns and rhythms. There isn't one standout difficult moment or pattern in this 4-minute map, instead it keeps an even consistency with harder/longer patterns mixed in that can easily whittle away at your stamina! The consistent density and \_yu68's great sense for patterning make [Blackmagik Blazing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1087782#taiko/2274690) constantly engaging and really fun!

Take a trip back to 2020 and try it out!

New to the Loved section is Negri_sk with *Helblinde - Zelda's Boner*. While it probably isn't as popular as before, around the time when this map was uploaded, you would always see it in every multiplayer lobby you joined at some point.

The map is filled to the brink with streams, streams and (I probably have already mentioned this) more streams! Near the end is also a pattern that gave me a little throwback to the ending of CLSW's map of *GUHROOVY - Stand Alone Beat Masta*, which is no longer submitted, but some older players will probably remember.

Give it a try and see what you think of the beautiful and descriptive song, as well as the beatmap itself!

[Until we meet again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsG-0_zA-s)

This month's SV special is going to be a bit uncharacteristic. As some of you may be aware, there's a non-negligible overlap between the Hololive fanbase and the osu!mania community. If I had a nickel for every SV mapper that had Amelia Watson as their oshi, I would have two nickels! One of those stands by the self-explanatory name of [AmeliaFangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16159418), providing us with the incredibly niche category of Hololive SV. I hope the [other one](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15756120) is going to find solace in figuring out their background image strategy.

Some of you might be surprised to learn that this has been featured in a tournament! Some of you might also be surprised to learn that a [Hololive-themed osu!mania team tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1590706) was organized by significant members of the community. I also played in that tournament, for some reason! The map itself is a pretty tame early-game entry, which is rhythmically lead by the vocal cadence of the song. Overall, a cute little treat that adds to the variety of our dear Loved library, and is friendly to newcomers to the SV category.

As one of the first major talents that the world has ever seen perform on osu!mania, I think that dedicating a spot to our recently graduated Amelia Watson is an apt send-off, and we wish her the best for her future endeavors. Feel free to express your thoughts and cast your votes in the thread as usual!

When I think of streams, the first thing that always comes to mind is [Zia's 4K Stream Training Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1561185#mania/3188405), and I believe that's the case for many others as well. [Zia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7979303) and several other notable mappers came together to create a pack that tests all the skill sets people associate with streams.

Honestly, it's very hard to highlight any specific map from this pack because all of them are of such high quality and incredibly fun to play. This pack contains something for everyone, from J-pop with [Meruheru Shouwakuse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1561185#mania/3188414), to hardcore with [Katagiri Catch Ball](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1561185#mania/3188412), and even iconic rhythm game songs like [Invisible Frenzy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1561185#mania/3188403).

If you're looking to improve your streaming capabilities, there's a guarantee that at least one map in this pack will meet your needs. So if you want to see yourself on the leaderboard or compare your scores with your friends, make sure to vote "yes" in the polls!

Hello. We're sure there are a lot of you who want easier charts going up, so here's a *very* easy one for you all!

[Lemon Tree](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1296605#mania) by [Lemmie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11700865) is a great chordjack chart for beginners! Due to how beginner-friendly it is, it has gained great traction for being such a great and simple choice, even having downrates! While 142 BPM on 1.0x might sound a little threatening, the super easy patterns can lead to great improvement for newer players looking to practice something slightly out of their skill range.

Okay, you get the joke. Realistically speaking, this chart is absurd. The main source of popularity this chart contains primarily comes from how dense and stamina draining it is. There are zero breaks, multiple quadwalls, and strenuous anchors. Despite it all, the chordjack mains can still make this look easy, so if you're still somehow not satisfied, you've got uprates as well, which... we're not even sure are possible? Either way, there's an audience for it, so if that's what you enjoy, have fun.

Sometimes we look at this chart and wonder at what point playing the game becomes an actual exercise. Instead of questioning that, we'll tell you to vote for this map instead and think nothing of it.

Ah yes, Terminal 11 songs and very awkward technical charting. These two always go hand in hand, and [Xay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/961417) is notorious for creating charts like this.

What makes [The Bird's Poisoned Bathwater](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/467388#mania/1000029) such a difficult chart is its overall structure. Throughout the entire map, you're really forced to focus and ensure that you accurately hit every single note. When it comes to tech charts mapped to music composed by Terminal 11, you really have to be careful not to lose control, as dirty misses tend to happen often on these kinds of files, leading to many dropped 200s, 100s, and even 50s.

Not to mention, the abundance of grace notes, minijacks, rolls, and anchors can really throw you off, especially if it's your first time playing them. It may not feel like the fastest song, but it more than makes up for that with how long it feels, requiring your full focus for every second of the map.

Looking at the chart, it makes perfect sense why this was selected for the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2016 Quarterfinals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2016_4K#quarterfinals). If you want to see more challenging charts like this, go vote "Yes"!

[Arcahv](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1184106#mania/2468487) (uprated to 1.05x) was notably featured in the [MWC 2021 4K Finals weekend](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K#finals). [Abraxos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5025064) is known for creating many difficult charts in the technical department, and his hybrids are certainly no slouch.

This map, in particular, has so many aspects that make it challenging. Right off the bat, it greets you with short LNs, which can make charts very technical. Throughout this chart, you have to expect that none of the patterns will be straightforward. There will definitely be a lot of choke points, whether in terms of accuracy or simply finding misses. Grace notes, anchors, and minijacks mixed with various LN releases create a difficult hybrid chart.

Not to mention, this is definitely a chart where you'd need to focus throughout, given all the patterns this map will throw at you. Even the lone break section in this file requires you to maintain full focus to ensure you don't lose much accuracy from those alone.

Honestly speaking, [Abraxos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5025064) has always done a wonderful job of creating hybrid charts that really push the limits of tournament players and their accuracy. If you feel the same way, I highly recommend giving this chart a favorable vote!

I must admit, I'm quite surprised [YuEast 2018](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13953619) has yet to receive a single Loved nomination. Either way, that changes today, with their chart of [Kamiari Algorithm (katagiri Bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2058829#mania)!

It's very likely most people know YuEast for their LN density charts, and that becomes very apparent when looking at their katagiri maps, as [2wise4u](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1813014#mania/3719207) is undoubtedly their most popular to date (which would definitely have gone up over this, but is currently [going for Ranked](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1984400#mania/4121538)). With that said, though, *Kamiari Algorithm (katagiri bootleg)* could be described as a spiritual successor of sorts, being made for [MWC 4K 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K), appearing in the Finals mappool at a 1.1x rate.

As expected of a density pick, it is... dense, to say the least. This type of pattern may be straightforward, but YuEast has managed to gain a very specific and unique style of approaching density, which is possibly why so many people prefer to play their charts, leading to more people going back to them due to how much more said patterns stick out.

Of course, this one is no exception, so it's recommended you give this highly respected charter their long-deserved spotlight!

This map also has many challenging elements, with a high BPM characteristic of fast rhythm game music and a relaxed pattern structure (you can see the top rankers farming on this type of map with DT).

The MAXIMUM difficulty has also been used in the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2019](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2019_7K) Semifinals mappool. We hope that many people will enjoy the nostalgia of challenge and competition.

The pack includes nine difficulties ranging from mid to expert levels, designed to help you develop a variety of skills. It starts with basic LN density and moderate layering, gradually evolving into more complex LN coordination and releases that require a high level of control and adaptability. The later stages feature faster LN inverse patterns mixed with shield patterns, offering an apex challenge for LN lovers!

We never shy away from picking popular packs because they provide more content for players to enjoy. Don't hesitate to give this map a favorable vote and help secure its spot in the Loved category!
