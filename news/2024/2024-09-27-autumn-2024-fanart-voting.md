Autumn is here, and with it **181** appropriately themed artworks to celebrate the occasion!

Now, with a mere 20 votes to choose your favourites among such a staggering selection, we'd normally shiver in terror, but the theme has [switched up a bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-09-06-autumn-fanart-contest), hasn't it?

To ease the selection process, we've compiled all of the entries in a sleek slideshow that's backed with calming, yet cheerful tunes from *Eientewi set 02 ~ Stirring an Autumn Moon* by [Rin / Function Phantom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/14):
