By popular demand, osu! will be taking a page from the books of other games. Watch [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) explain what's happening along with [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) in the video below, or read on for the quick summary.

With support from almost 3,000 of you in the comments of [a previous YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUSxEjQQ1UI), **daily challenges** are now live!

These are daily featured beatmaps accessible from the "play" section of the main menu, where anyone can compete with live updates.

Each day will introduce one new map with increased difficulty, resetting after a week.

After passing the beatmap of the day, it will be counted towards "daily challenge" totals on the profile (which are updated at the end of each day).

You'll find the daily challenges on the osu!(lazer) client, which you can [download here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download). For now, this feature only concerns the osu! game mode.

If this feature piques the interest of many and sparks engagement in the community, it will be expanded upon. In other words, the devs will listen to how the community feels about it, so don't hesitate to voice your thoughts and feedback.

See you in-game!
