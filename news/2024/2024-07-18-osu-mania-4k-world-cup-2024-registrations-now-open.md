Following our latest entry on the official tournament calendar ([Lazer Grand Arena](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-06-18-lazer-grand-arena-registrations-now-open), if you haven't checked it yet) comes our yearly patented 4 key smashing competition. There are no major changes in the format for this year's osu!mania 4K World Cup, as the mappoolers are focusing on refining the current structure instead, lazer-focused (pun intended) on bringing the highest levels of awesomeness possible to viewers and competitors alike.

## How do I register?

**[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/46)**

Please note that teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded. **The deadline for registering is August 1, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to submit yours before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu!mania 4K global ranking is #5,000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

***Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, send an email to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).***

This last point is so important, we've made sure to both ***bold AND italicise it***. No exceptions will be made for late registrations, so make sure to press that shiny pink button as soon as it's available (i.e. RIGHT NOW)!
