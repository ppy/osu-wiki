You sit at your desk every day. You play osu! every day. You can see where we're going with this.

A couple years ago, we celebrated osu!'s 15th anniversary with limited edition deskmats, and some of you pointed out that these "deskmats" were barely big enough to fit a keyboard.

So we expanded.

## [circle clicker deskmat](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1347)

This cursor dance through the ~~fool moon~~ night sky is a simple homage to the osu! player's daily routine: clicking circles at mach speed atop a 100% dimmed background.

Doubling the width of our previous deskmat, this titan is guaranteed to hold your mouse, keyboard, tablet, and at least 19 pippi plushies.

And most importantly, it looks really cool.

We have to give credit where it's due: renowned mapper [Sing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3795679) is the mastermind behind this design! Send your accolades his direction.

If you want to snag one of these for yourself, [**head to the store page**](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1347)!

## Fanart deskmats

We host a bunch of [fanart contests](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests) each year, and the winners are displayed on osu!'s main menu. It's about time we bring some of them into reality!

### [sakura pippi deskmat](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1349)

Jumping back to [Spring 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/125), [Xeth](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14743626)'s pristinely pink pippi piece was begging to make its way to the physical realm, so we worked together to [make it happen](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1349)!

### [*everything* deskmat](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1348)

This one is [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2)'s personal favorite: In [osu!'s 15th anniversary art contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-09-15-anniversary-art-contest-results#peppy's-picks), [YOOKA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15825663) crafted an ultra-dense artwork showcasing 15 years worth of references and memes.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-08-17-osu-deskmats/everything.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1348)

In the production process, we worked with YOOKA to update the artwork so it fits our wide deskmats, which led to the inclusion of even more memes that were generated throughout the last couple years.

Packed with easily over 100 references, [this pad](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1348) can only be fully understood by those who've been playing osu! for longer than many top players have been alive.
