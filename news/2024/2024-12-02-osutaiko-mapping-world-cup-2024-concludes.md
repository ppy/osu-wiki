Welcome to the recap of the osu!taiko Mapping World Cup 2024!

![](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2024/img/banner.jpg)

The osu!taiko Mapping World Cup was a country-based, multi-stage osu!taiko mapping contest on a scale unlike anything seen previously in the osu!taiko scene. Across multiple rounds of mapping, we crowned our winner, the best current osu!taiko mapping country!

If you want to read about the rules, contest format, schedule, or judging criteria, please check out this contest's [wiki page](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2024) and [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1865674) for more information.

## Results

## Original songs

We had the chance to showcase some original works made specifically for this contest in the form of [custom songs](/wiki/osu!_originals). While they were made for this contest, the artists have agreed that all of these songs are available for anyone in the osu! community to map, and not just in osu!taiko!

### [Chiru-san - Gleam](http://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/osu!taiko%20Mapping%20World%20Cup%202024%20-%20Chiru-san%20-%20Gleam.osz)

The first custom song revealed was [Chiru-san](https://soundcloud.com/chiru-sancontinued)'s *Gleam*. This upbeat bright song was used in the first stage of the contest, with the restriction that maps had to be mechanically simple.

### [![SoundCloud](/wiki/shared/link/SoundCloud.png)](https://soundcloud.com/itsxyris/crash-landing-rendezvous-tmwc-r2 "SoundCloud") [Xyris - Crash-Landing Rendezvous](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/osu!taiko%20Mapping%20World%20Cup%202024%20-%20Xyris%20-%20Crash-Landing%20Rendezvous.osz)

A familiar face to the osu! community also made an appearance when [Xyris](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/433) provided a chaotic song switching between tempos and genres for teams to sink their teeth into.

### [![SoundCloud](/wiki/shared/link/SoundCloud.png)](https://soundcloud.com/sydosys/divergence "SoundCloud") [![Spotify](/wiki/shared/link/Spotify.png)](https://open.spotify.com/album/2UBAurx9s6AJx1ZMFQywvT "Spotify") [![Bandcamp](/wiki/shared/link/Bandcamp.png)](https://sydosys.bandcamp.com/track/divergence "Bandcamp") [Sydosys - Divergence](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/osu!taiko%20Mapping%20World%20Cup%202024%20-%20Sydosys%20-%20Divergence.osz)

Yet another familiar face showed up with [Sydosys](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/392) creating the song *Divergence*. This track shows a style that Sydosys has become synonymous with, where complex rhythms and layers allowing mappers to go wild.

### [![SoundCloud](/wiki/shared/link/SoundCloud.png)](https://soundcloud.com/r4m3n50up/golden-gloss "SoundCloud") [![YouTube](/wiki/shared/link/YouTube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDISRzO88iQ "YouTube") [Spehs - GOLDEN✧GLOSS](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/osu!taiko%20Mapping%20World%20Cup%202024%20-%20Spehs%20-%20GOLDEN+GLOSS.osz)

The last custom song was made by [Spehs](https://soundcloud.com/r4m3n50up), someone who had played osu! before but had not made their presence as an artist known before. By far the most complex song in terms of timings, this song mixes many different rhythms and rapidly changing BPMs that allowed mappers to demonstrate their skills.
