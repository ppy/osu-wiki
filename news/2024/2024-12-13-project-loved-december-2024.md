Happy holidays and welcome to this month's Project Loved post! With the excitement of the season, you may have forgotten what we're all about. Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll. Alternatively you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

Straight from your Spotify Wrapped, [Yorushika - Dakara Boku wa Ongaku o Yameta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/961450#osu/2012763) arrives to take its rightful place as this month's first Popular Playcounts pick. [Awaken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1380253), [Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923), [Flask](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/959763), and a bunch of other classic mappers bring their own takes on one of the most iconic J-pop anthems of the last decade. Jump into a field of aim and alt control, as each collab and difficulty has that extra flair making them stand out from the rest.

Not much else for me to say here, but for you? VOTE YES!

SING....

This month's second *Popular Playcounts* pick features one of the most well-known 10‚òÖ maps in the game. [DJ Mars - Lemon Tree (Lemon Dance Radio Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1194047#osu), mapped by [waywern2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5870453), was popularised by top players trying to get some good runs on this map. At first, the runs were rough, then they were decent, then they were legendary. Some of the game's best aim plays were set on this beatmap for a while, and just like [Crazy banger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1232750#osu/2562794), we've seen what top players are capable of doing when pushing their own limits on waywern2012's jumpy mapping style. Lemon Tree, however, pushes it a notch further, at a whopping 10.41‚òÖ (as of writing this!). Of course, there's a Watermelon (CS3) difficulty which makes things.... very slightly easier. It's definitely not a map for beginners, but don't let that keep you from trying to become the next legendary aim player!

This map pretty much needs no introduction ‚Äî just look at the mapper list and you know that you're in for an absolute treat. Some of the greatest tech mappers in the last decade came together to make one of the most incredible megacollab projects this game has seen, and it's an absolute 8-minute tech adventure from start to finish.

Don't let this drown.... Vote yes...

It's time to lock in for this month's *Daredevil Difficulties*, it's [DixAway](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172901) and [rnuxk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10643960)'s collab of [Camellia - We Could Get More Machinegun Psystyle! (And More Genre Switches)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1238488#osu/2575008)! If you're an avid follower of top players, then you might have seen Vaxei set [this crazy play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9p1RiZTa38) last year.

Sitting at an intimidating 9.07‚òÖ and 5:07, this map features blazing fast jumps and tons of tricky alt patterns for you to suffer on. Luckily for you, there are a few periods of downtime for you to catch your breath!

Good luck on this one, and make sure to cast your vote if you want to see this map have a home in the Loved section!

December's *Ranked Rejects* will tickle your brain, we have [Sota Fujimori - Modular Technology](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1210574#osu/2869650) mapped by [feiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3214844), [bad boy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545323), [IOException](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688103), and [Sebu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3990173) with hitsounds by [Zer0-G](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12577911)!

Ranging from 2.28‚òÖ to 8.41‚òÖ, this set offers tricky finger control and erratic patterning to match the groovy yet unpredictable nature of the song. Whether you're practicing your skills on more unconventional maps or are looking for a challenge, Modular Technology has a difficulty for anyone to enjoy.

Unfortunately, this set was never quite finished and we think it deserves a place in the Loved section, so make sure to cast your vote if you agree!

Originally a custom for [Charlie's Perfect Math Class](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1570901?n=1), for our *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick this month we have [LEVEL-DOWN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1799413#osu/3688767). This is [ktgster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/53378)'s sixth time entering the Loved voting! And with the work of Featured Artist [II-L](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/172), and storyboarder [Apichu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14967853), the three are able to bring you an interactive experience, featuring a reading and finger control zenith that makes you feel like you're solving some kind of demented-rhythm jigsaw puzzle. And just if you wanted to make your life EVEN harder, make sure to check out the more challenging AR 0 difficulty. Don't be scared.

Vote YES for this pick if you want to be on the nice list. Also, Merry Gimmickmas everyone. üéÑ

There's something just so... special about this map... I really couldn't pinpoint what allows it to be as great as it is... maybe it's some sort of *Rakka Factor*... heh...

Joking aside, this 7.74‚òÖ collab between [PandaHero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1233255) and [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009) is magnificent. The difficulty arises from high-spacing cut streams at 174 BPM, providing quite the challenge over its 3:38 runtime. Go out and try this one for yourself, because you won't regret it.

*Honey Trap* will challenge many players, even if you're already well experienced with some swing and tech! Can you keep up with the rapid pace and nail those complex snappings?

Step into the trap, embrace the honey, and see if you have what it takes to conquer all the difficulties!

This is a custom map for the Semifinals tiebreaker of [Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022), a large-scale osu!taiko tournament. Because it is a large-scale tournament, the map is structured in such a way that it is very challenging and makes you tense, so you can feel as if you are actually playing in the tournament. We hope you will experience that sensation by playing this map.

KitajimaYN, now known as [Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574), is back to the monthly Loved post. It's no surprise, since they are one of the most prominent and longstanding mappers in the osu!taiko scene, being able to amass thousands of plays in their maps, ranked or graveyarded. Collaborating with another prominent mapper like [maguro869](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4733750) only further increases the amount of popularity a map can get.

[Rettou Joutou(BRING IT ON) ft.Kagamine Rin&Ren (Yozumina Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/952710#taiko/1989287) is a burst-heavy map, with complicated mixed-snapping streams that go along a really upbeat VOCALOID remix. This map with its collection of patterns, bursts, rhythms and all those elements that scream of a KTYN and maguro collab, serves as an excellent benchmark for people eager to test their skills and who are up to a challenge. A leaderboard would make the process of recording your skill progression better. It's up to you, the player, to decide. Go give this map a try if you haven't, and as always, never forget to have fun!

Brace yourself for this extreme challenge of intensity with [AMAZING BREAK](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/628412#taiko/1324887), where you will experience exactly the opposite of what the title suggests!

*AMAZING BREAK* is quite an infamous song in other modes already, due to the of insane density of the song. Who else could map this song better than [nananass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7231722), a mapper known for pushing even high-ranked players to their limits with his extremely difficult maps.

Despite its short duration, AMAZING BREAK packs a punch with its high density, reaching up to 306 BPM! This map is a true stamina and speed challenge, already beloved by many high-ranked players for its challenging nature.

Are you ready to join others in the ultimate test of your stamina skills?

You might think that [asteria - i didn't need you anyway](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1681892#taiko), mapped by [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) and used in famous tournaments such as [SGTS](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/SGTS_2021) and [END2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1833578?n=1), is a normal speed map just by listening to the song. But that is a mistake, and the map hides more difficulties than one might imagine!

Finishers flowing at 220 BPM confuse players and greatly increase the difficulty level. Also, the 1/6 that suddenly flows in at the point in the middle where the SV is slow should tempt the combo break! Overall, the map is a good one, with a high degree of perfection that makes you want to try again and again, and the more you play, the more fun you will have.

Thank you for participating in this year's Project Loved vote! Look forward to next year, when we will have new captains and will introduce even more unique and well-loved maps that should be Loved!

Merry Xmas and have a Happy New Year!! <3

The culmination of these elements tests precision greatly while simultaneously being extremely dense, creating one of the most unique tournament maps ever devised. From sliders to snappy turnarounds to precise doubles, the three sections of terror will leave almost all players struggling to master all the skills for an FC. Are you up for the challenge?

An unusual map this time around, as it kind of resembles a convert adjusted in a way that makes it very playable in osu!catch. Because of that, there are a lot of unique patterns that you usually don't see in catch mapping. Some of them are definitely hard to hit, but nothing really feels unfair. [wonjae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5032045) and [Liyac](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4994598) did a really good job with this map, and if you like to play both converts and specifics, then you will probably have fun with this one!

[ke-ji feat. Nanahira - Ange du blanc Pur](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/573538#mania) by [midgy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6312055)\

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[midgy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6312055) has made a lot of great jumpstream/handstream/stamina files, and [Ange du blanc Pur](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/573538#mania/1214941) is a great example of one of these.

First of all, this may seem like your typical jumpstream chart, but there are many difficulties that come along with it. Obviously, the length being at 3 minutes and 57 seconds gives you an added difficulty in stamina, though what is so interesting about this chart is how both the elements of trilling and hitting those jumps are mixed together.

Trills are extremely difficult to hit if you are not careful, and in this file, while the trills on the first jumpstream patterns that you will see aren't the most dense, they can be challenging to control. Over the course of this chart, you will see some chordjacks, jumptrills (even a little bit of splittrills at this point), and even minijacks that can make you even more unstable. Once you get past those however, jumpstreams will definitely start to tire you out the further you progress in this chart.

You may notice that at some point in this chart, some hands will also start to show up. Through that, density also increases, and as you keep on progressing through this chart, you will really see how stamina-draining this file can be. Let's not forget to mention, this chart has rates up to 1.4x, raising the BPM from 182 to around 254.8.

[midgy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6312055) has been really stepping up to the occasion when it comes to charting jumpstreams and stamina charts, and this chart really shows a lot of her creativity in charting. If you think so as well, go give this chart a favorable vote in the Loved section!

Former Loved captain \[[Crz\]hinako1804](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13747903) makes a return! However, instead of a pack such as [Technical Complexes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240175#mania/2578347), their chart of [Bring Our Ignition Back](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1684011#mania/3440885) gets this month's spotlight!

Perhaps one of the first things you think of when seeing this is [Evening's version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1188926#mania/2477446), but you can rest assured knowing that they both differ from one another in their own unique way, as this one has much more focus on the chordjack element within the music.

Used in the [SOFT 6](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/6) Semifinals pool, *Bring Our Ignition Back* was proven to be a great pick thanks to the progressiveness of the song, causing for unexpected stamina drain within the chart. Even with heavy chordjack layering, it also throws some 1/8 bursts at you, which might lead to a surprise miss or drop in accuracy, which has proven to be a very big deal in a tournament environment.

Hinako continues to prove that they absolutely know how to make an engaging chordjack chart, so show your recognition with a vote!

Somehow, [aeoliancarp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1027529) still has only one nomination. Let's change that!

If you don't recognize the name, [aeoliancarp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1027529) has gained a good reputation for their rice charts, and possibly better known as [VisD](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/profile/VisD/) on sites such as FFR. [Traveler \~Stand Aloof\~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1414239#mania/2915010) has managed to be one of their more notable ones (despite all their charts being notable, realistically speaking), as it was a pick in the [NAMT 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1709585?n=1) Semifinals pool.

There are two difficulties that this chart has to offer, with the lower difficulty being easier for the sake of focusing on the song's representation, and the higher diff being more catered towards tournaments, which is why it's also the one that has uprates included in the set. The chart is rather bursty with added jacks and isolated minijacks, so it makes great sense as to why tournaments would continue to pick up this chart.

Enough talking about tournaments. If you just want to play a well-made chart, vote in the thread.

[Last Resort](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/740537#mania/1562400) is such a versatile chart. There are so many difficulties provided here, each one probably suited for whatever skill level you are in (hence the high play count), and that alone makes it for a potential pick for this iteration of Project Loved.

Hosted by [Aruel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3984370), commonly known as *Fresh Chicken*, featuring guest difficulties by [Arpia97](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6363008) and [Lude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6974536), *Last Resort* is a great example of the older-styled charts you'd see back during the time it was uploaded, as the majority of hard Ranked charts consisted of similar ideas and patterns. In fact, you can see this quite well in Aruel's last nomination, [A Lasting Promise](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/740015#mania/1565608).

As said before, it resembles old-style charting very well, as it came from someone who was well known for such a thing, and if you don't know what to expect from one, you'll typically be greeted with handstreams, 1/8 trills, and heavy chords. This approach to charting doesn't have nearly as much of a prominence as it did back then, but that's not to say it's bad! Much of the value behind charts like these is held high due to those factors, and if it wasn't already obvious enough, this set is popular. Like, really really popular.

It's somewhat of a shock to see that this never reached Ranked status, despite the immense popularity it held and the fact that Aruel has ranked many charts in the past, but with the power of your vote, you can make it happen!

[Stability](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701738) is an exceptional player when it comes to playing very acc-heavy LN charts, and [FREE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1541763#mania) represents his true understanding on how to create charts for the skillset.

To start things off, this chart isn't exactly the fastest at 132 BPM; however, it can really give players a challenge especially with how LNs in tournaments tend to be faster. While the patterning isn't the most difficult, what makes this so challenging is being able to coordinate every finger on each long note. Imagine having to take note of the density of the chart, while having to ensure that you aren't rushing, or going too slow. Thankfully, OD 7.2 isn't the most strict either, but if 200 counts aren't going to be your problem, then your 320 to 300 ratio would certainly be among the challenges you'll have to face.

This definitely is one of those "high-scoring" charts, wherein for you to have a competitive score, you REALLY need to perform at your best. As I mentioned a while ago, [Stability](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701738) really shines on charts like this, and he's proven to be extremely capable on tournaments such as the osu!mania World Cup.

The pack features 11 difficulties ranging from easy to expert levels, which are tailored for newcomers and casual players who want to enjoy playing anime songs while also learning the ropes of playing 10K.

As the community grows bigger, we have big expectations for promoting more of such content in the future to represent the of anti-meta picks for the Loved community, and we hope that you guys show support by casting positive votes for this map!
