## Editor changes

- **The gameplay testing hotkeys were implemented, and new hotkeys were added for slider curve types.** Bookmarks and autoplay speed are still not added as part of the testing hotkeys, but now you can toggle autoplay with `Tab`, pause with `Ctrl` + `P`, exit from the initial position with `F1`, and exit from the current position with `F2`. As for the slider curve types, you can toggle different types with `Alt` + `1` through `5`.
- **You can now jump to specific timestamps by pasting them in the bottom bar in the editor.** This is a very small UI change that will mean a lot to mappers, especially when it comes to modding.

- **Beatmap contents can now be edited externally.** Due to the way osu!(lazer) handles beatmaps, you were not able to just open the songs folder and edit whatever you wanted, but after today, that is possible. The sounds of cheering from mapping enthusiasts can be heard around the world.

- **Exported maps made in osu!(lazer) should no longer be broken if they are imported to osu!(stable).** This is yet another step that's making mapping in osu!(lazer) closer to reality.
- **Hexagonal and circular options have been added to the snap grid.** Expanding on the snap grid editing change made last month, more options have been added which will make the mapping journey easier for both veteran and newbie mappers.
- **Various improvements have been made to the editor UI.** Long story short, timelines have been slightly reduced, colours for timing points and kiai's have been changed, and tooltips on hover have been added to make it clear to newer players what each marker and highlighted section in the timeline mean.

## Other changes

- **The ruleset selector has new samples, and some UI samples got refreshed.** See if you can spot the UI samples that got changed!

</div>

- **New "No Release" mod has been added to osu!mania.** This makes osu!mania hold notes work like some other VSRGs, completely removing the accuracy judgement from releases. It's also the same way sliders work in the osu! game mode.
- **The colour of the mod multiplier has been changed to match the mod icon background.** If a mod is increasing difficulty, the mod multiplier will now be red, and if the mod is decreasing difficulty, the mod multiplier will be green.
- **The mod customisation menu options have moved.** Previously the customisation menu popped up from below upon pressing the "Mod Customisation" button, and that clashed with the upcoming redesign of the song selection screen. That button has now been replaced with a dropdown menu located on the top right of the mod selection screen.
- **The beatmap filters overlay has been updated.** Players kept getting confused why the in-game beatmap listing didn't work properly, without realising that the "Featured Artists" filter is selected by default, so now it's been updated to be more visible.
