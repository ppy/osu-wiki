**Candle** might be the spark you need to finally learn how to map.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/431/header.jpg)

Hailing from New York, **Candle** has been spewing EDM tunes for years, inspired by the likes of *Snail's House*, *Madeon*, plus our very own Featured Artists [*Hyper Potions*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/85), [*Synthion*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/357), and [*Mameyudoufu*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/209)!

[**Candle**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/431) has pre-timed beatmap templates for **8** songs, one (or all) of which are bound to become your next map.

Somehow every one of [\[FL\]ash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3756437)'s top plays use the Flashlight mod. See how that pairs with one of **Candle**'s songs down here:
