## Beatmapping

### Limitation

While the general idea behind most mapping contests is "create the best map", the Monthly Beatmapping Contest adds a new layer called "limitations" to keep things from being stale. These are essentially extra rules specific to the month's contest.

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (for osu!) or [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063) (for osu!mania).

#### osu!

Slider design has evolved considerably over the years, in part thanks to a specific rule for Insane and Expert difficulties in the [Ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria):

> The slider path is allowed to be ambiguous if the cursor can stay inside the slider's follow circle without any movement away from the slider head.

Many mappers have extrapolated on this rule, claiming that a slider is okay for ranking so long as full score can be earned without moving the cursor.

This month's contest aims to utilise this confusing rule to the fullest: **every slider's tail position must touch its head position.**

#### osu!mania

osu!(stable)'s editor comes with this handy `Beat Snap Divisor` tool in the top right: 

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-12-06-monthly-beatmapping-contest-december-2024/beat-snap-divisor.jpg)

For this month's osu!mania contest:

- **You must use every beat snap divisor available in the osu!(stable) editor**
- **You must *not* use other beat snap divisors, such as those available in osu!(lazer) or through `.osu` file editing.**

Part of this contest's gimmick is seeing how effectively mappers can use variable beat snap divisors. Choose a song that allows for experimentation!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!:** every slider's tail position must touch its head position.
  - **osu!mania:**
    - You must use every beat snap divisor available in the osu!(stable) editor.

- **Submissions must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
