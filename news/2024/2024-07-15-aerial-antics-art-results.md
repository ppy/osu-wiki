The summer breeze brings July, menu art, and you.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results/banner.jpg)

**3,316** of you took it upon yourselves to carefully lay out an abysmally low **15** votes across **133** uniquely stellar entries, and together we crown the finalists of this contest! This means another batch of main menu artwork is ready, as well as another prize that you can read up on further down.

Enough yapping, let's get to the results!

### Finalists

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/RedcXca.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/RedcXca.png)

[**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601)'s winning rendition of Alisa's stratospheric radiance stole the sights of **1745** stargazers, of which the especially attentive also noticed several of the cameos (aside from Miku).

For perhaps the same reason that may have garnered some portion of the eyes on this entry, the full artwork along with some others won't be making it to the main menu. However, that doesn't bar [**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601) from every other perk of landing all the way at the top, including osu!supporter, a unique profile badge and being featured in [limited-time default profile covers](#new-profile-customisations) (along with the other top 3)!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/mocapixel.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/mocapixel.png)

[**mocapixel**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11596939) reinterpreted the space above the city skylines as merely a gateway into the deep sea world. The concept of a pensive Alisa chilling on a floating jellyfish while fusing the contest theme with its inversion invited **1684** dreamers into her reverie, a place of DiVE orbs and gargantuan wind fish.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/KAITO%20thighs.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/KAITO%20thighs.png)

Summer festivities have started, but pippi seems content in viewing the action from above while Don is content just going along for the ride. **1455** (>ヮ<)-faced individuals were drawn to this floaty scene brought to you by [**KAITO thighs**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) (a.k.a. Dreamxiety).

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/X-ill.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/X-ill.png)

Escorted by a particular set of transitory avian friends, you may catch a glimpse on morning skies of Mari on her little-known errands as the Dragonstar.

Or so the legend goes...

[**X-ill**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21771922) knows Don would barely be holding on. **1261** witnesses cheered for one of both of them.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/powocy.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/powocy.jpg)

[**powocy**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30688502) took Mocha and pippi to a cruise on the sky whale express, eliciting unprovoked jealousy as **1224** voters in need of a vacation wished they could do the same.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/LeeNarie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/LeeNarie.jpg)

[**LeeNarie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2667849)'s magic let pippi see the early view of dawn and **1209** of you fell into wonder.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/-Rei.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/-Rei.jpg)

[**-Rei**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8200707)'s angelic pippi captured the attention of **1162** ladies and gentlemen who recognised the artwork as unique, refined and aesthetic, so up the charts it went.

The astute observers also recognised [**-Rei**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8200707)'s taste in music shine through this piece. Regular observers didn't. If there are no such people, then we must be lunatics.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Type.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Type.png)

[**Type**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7520534)'s slightly-out-of-season-but-thematically-valid vampire pippi left **1161** humans to watch in speechless awe and respectfully leave their votes behind while hoping they're not the ones in her sights.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/tsunmQ.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/tsunmQ.png)

pippi and Don's aerial lemonade delivery service takes [**tsunmQ**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12011452)'s colourful refreshments across yet more colourful skies and right to the people who need it the most at the moment, wherever they are. **1108** positive reviews later and their next destination is a main menu near you!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Partyu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Partyu.PNG)

[**Partyu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12659629) decided it was Tama's turn to look badass while fearlessly training on wooden poles at unspecified heights.

Or maybe she's in the middle of a match against a worthy adversary and has just activated her special raven summoning move. Regardless, Don is there to watch in approval and so were **1099** of you.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Vio.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Vio.png)

[**Vio**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5661237)'s bright depiction of Mocha floating away with her parasol and white dress enchanted **1057** Mocha enjoyers.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/CybertCat.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/CybertCat.png)

Mocha's Chinese New Year aesthetic designed by [**CybertCat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3789010) caught the eyes of **912** festival-goers.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/leeian.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/leeian.png)

When anyone in the osu! community thinks of the sky, they think of [FREEDOM DiVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/39804#osu/129891), leading to the iconic orb mascots from its album art becoming somewhat of a staple cameo in these art contests.

[**leeian**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12595640)'s skydiving pippi (and Don) may perhaps have been the most exemplary in executing this idea, gathering **907** adorers from the community and blasting them all the way up to the finalists.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/hurbruh.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/hurbruh.png)

Using artistic powers, [**hurbruh**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18537231) managed to place pippi, Mocha, and Chirou (not forgetting Don) in free fall above the clouds, hopefully with parachutes somewhere within reach.

Unlike Mocha, pippi seems totally unfazed, impressing **901** friends from all over the world. If this is her taking a selfie then we're doubly impressed. Maybe this was her idea.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Creameries.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Creameries.png)

[**Creameries**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15851364)' celestial empress Chirou commanded reverence from **880** of us mortals.

Following her trip well and beyond the stratosphere at this point, this certainly was an unexpected surprise, yet a surprisingly welcome one.

### peppy's Picks

With the staggering amount of mindblowing entries this time, many of you thought that 15 finalists were simply not enough, and luckily for everyone, peppy agrees! For he who holds it hath decided to cast his almighty power of The Pick™, and by which blessed us with an additional **20** main menu backgrounds for all our viewing pleasure!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/IVFX.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/IVFX.png)

[**IVFX**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35013315)'s rendition of a breathtakingly angelic Don scouring through a stellar candy pink sky was simply too stunning not to have a place in The Dean's heart (and the main menu too).

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/-northern-.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/-northern-.png)

[**-northern-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16247587) takes us to a stylistic view of a cute scene of Yuzu, Alisa, pippi and Chirou taking in the breeze above the clouds, engaging in random shenanigans while going who-knows-where (and also the main menu).

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Alptraum.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Alptraum.jpg)

[**Alptraum**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26496648) fuses all colours of the osu! cast into a vibrant view of a carefree time up above the world.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/fartfartfart.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/fartfartfart.jpg)

[**fartfartfart**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15892637) gave catgirl pippi wings and let her explore the sky world along with Don to her adventurous heart's content, going wherever the wind and sky fish take her.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Danimato.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Danimato.png)

[**Danimato**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23541645) drew so many balloons into existence that they could lift pippi and Don all the way into the azure sky. So many, that the sheer number of joyful colours should be enough to paint a smile on anyone's face — pippi's, peppy's, Don's, and hopefully yours.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/gamemoretv.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/gamemoretv.png)

[**gamemoretv**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22646541)'s aerial view of pippi, Mocha and Don (and his similar-looking friend) were too cute to ignore.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Curcuma.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Curcuma.png)

[**Curcuma**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18380221) takes the four game modes into spotlight with a skyward view of our mascots diving with circles, drums (pretend Don's face is a drum), fruits and keyboards. Capturing the essence of osu! and embodying the theme's freedom, this one is too perfect to give a miss.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/-%20Y%20u%20m%20i%20J%20i-.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/-%20Y%20u%20m%20i%20J%20i-.jpg)

[**- Y u m i J i-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7656048)'s painterly mary "pippi" pippins piece piqued peppy's positive pondering pertaining the picture.

It's good art.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/TogiraW.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/TogiraW.png)

pippi, Yuzu and Mocha steel themselves for some shoot 'em up bullet hell action in [**TogiraW**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20149300)'s GameBoy-styled pixel art piece.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/kaitacular.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/kaitacular.jpeg)

[**kaitacular**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23549012) imagined pippi dragging Mocha into yet another adventure across the skies in a Don-shaped airship, braving the vast fantasy world.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/MeowMiaw.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/MeowMiaw.png)

[**MeowMiaw**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23071617) brings the osu! cast together with characters from other franchises on an exciting paragliding/hang gliding/air ballooning trip... well, maybe less so for Mocha on the Taikonator rocket.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/nemdot.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/nemdot.png)

It's Yuzu, it's pippi, it's Mocha, all on a trip to a faraway land. [**nemdot**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12363663) and a few other artists seem to have collectively agreed that Mocha is not always the best with aerial action.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/raflonehero.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/raflonehero.png)

[**raflonehero**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17021689) presents us with Tama and Chirou peeking behind the osu! cookie together with Don and Taikonator, while soaring through the blue sky at blistering speeds.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/twinklesunnysun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/twinklesunnysun.png)

The four game mode mascots each show their main strengths in [**twinklesunnysun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12415406)'s twilit sky — pippi slicing incoming fruits with circles, Yuzu barely keeping his plate in check, and Mani being Mari's bane of sibling existence.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Kuutti.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Kuutti.png)

[**Kuutti**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19238888)'s take on pippi and Mocha skydiving against regulations together with a squadron of Dons gives that nostalgic feel of classic anime art styles (especially with pippi's original outfit from over a decade ago), which we're welcoming with open arms.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/SwokeSweed.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/SwokeSweed.png)

[**SwokeSweed**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23224574) conveys a more simple, still moment of respite for pippi and Mocha to appreciate the boundless skies, free of deliberation regarding what to do next. It's a unique vibe.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/neymar.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/neymar.jpg)

[**neymar**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10360109) brings us a relaxed, more dark-haired pippi freedom diving through the troposphere together with an excited Aiko, each enjoying the experience in their own way.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Emz.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Emz.png)

Mocha's pouting stare seems to go by unnoticed while pippi is ahead in the race. Such is her predicament in [**Emz**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15083883)'s amusing display of subtle characterisation between the two.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Rockxer.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Rockxer.png)

[**Rockxer**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34705396) shows us that if you fall from the sky, fruits might come along for the ride. Whether this is the first time that some of our cast witnesses this phenomenon doesn't matter, as the great scenery is enough to be more immersive than the task of catching the fruit.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/banners/Jk909.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/215/winners/Jk909.png)

[**Jk909**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16661628) takes a cheerful schoolgirl pippi and puts her airborne in a more straightforward take of the contest theme.
