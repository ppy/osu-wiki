If you're dedicated to the art of designing digital drums and/or fruit, this month's contest was created just for you.

For anyone out of the loop, the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) has been an osu! tradition for over a decade at this point. The premise is (unsurprisingly) a beatmapping contest held every month. 

This month's iteration is for **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch** mappers:

And special thanks to [Nelly](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4741164) for coordinating the Monthly Beatmapping Contest for osu!catch throughout the last year! Starting with this month's contest, [Morusya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13681464) is stepping up to the plate in his stead.

### Limitation

We keep things fresh around here with *limitations*, a.k.a. special rules that make each month's contest unique.

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [Morusya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13681464) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

Following in the footsteps of [the latest osu! and osu!mania MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-10-02-monthly-beatmapping-contest-october-2024), osu!taiko's limitation this month is extremely straightforward: 

**Find one other mapper and make a map together!**

...plus these minor rules as a safety net:

- **Both mappers should contribute equally to the map.**
- **The drain time must be at least of 2 minutes, not accounting for break times.**
- **Include each mapper's username in the beatmap's tags.**

This is the least restrictive limitation to date, so enjoy the freedom ~~while you can~~!

#### osu!catch

Movement is one of the most vital parts of osu!catch map composition. That's why this month's restriction completely changes how movement works.

**All hyperdashes must be followed by a standstill.**

For extra clarity, this means the two objects after a hyperdash must be possible to catch without any movement. (And if you make a map without hyperdashes, don't expect to receive high scores from judges!)

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!taiko:** find one other mapper and make a map together
  - **osu!catch:** all hyperdashes must be followed by a standstill
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
