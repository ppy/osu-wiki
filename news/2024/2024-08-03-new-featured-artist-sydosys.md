If you've played an osu! tournament in the last year, odds are you've heard **Sydosys**'s music.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/392/header.jpg)

From *5 Digit World Cup*, *Aim Cup 3*, *Battle of the Box*, *The Roundtable II*, and *COEGTS*, to our very own [world cups](/wiki/Tournaments#official-world-cups) and even [Lazer Grand Arena](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA/2024), our [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) catalogue is packed with **Sydosys**'s music.

Considering some of **Sydosys**'s biggest inspirations are *OOPARTS* and *XNOR XNOR XNOR*, none of this should come as a surprise. **Sydosys** has a knack for omnigenre full flavour pieces, making each of their distinctly different tunes a perfect fit for rhythm games (including osu!).

Some people may have noticed that **Sydosys** was part of our Featured Artist catalogue earlier than today. [This clip explains the situation.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkaBPmIm8hLVeLlZhZg5tDzjtwyhgCx27?feature=shared)

Today, we're making **Sydosys**'s status as a Featured Artist to the forefront! Visit [**Sydosys**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/392) for **12** pre-timed beatmap templates of (mostly) osu! original songs.

The latest addition to **Sydosys**'s discography was his track [HONOR//REPROACH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2222372) for [LGA](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA/2024), sightread in the Grand Finals! Here's how that went:
