Simply put, our latest Featured Artist **uynet** (pronounced "yuinet") is a lover of piano and all things cute.

Their retro-inspired and charming tracks showcase an energetic atmosphere that perfectly fits **uynet**'s persona, while simultaneously meeting the complex needs of rhythm game players. That's a hard combo to achieve, and it's why **uynet** is now part of our Featured Artists!

**6** pre-timed beatmap templates are part of [**uynet**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/453). Pick out however many you need and start bringing **uynet**'s sound into reality (assuming "reality" is clickable circles).
