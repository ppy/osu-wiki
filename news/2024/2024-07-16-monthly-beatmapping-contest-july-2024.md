It might be too hot to go outside, but at least you can prove you're a top-tier mapper this summer!

Legend has it that the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is a beatmapping contest that occurs monthly. The legend is surprisingly straightforward.

This month, we're focusing on **osu!** and **osu!mania**. osu!taiko and osu!catch mappers can hone their skills until next month.

This article is split into sections. Skip around:

## Beatmapping

There have been over 20 Monthly Beatmapping Contests since 2020. It would be boring if every contest was the same, so we throw **themes** and **limitations** into the mix.

These are essentially rules specific to each contest, so you can't reuse the same map each month.

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (for osu!) or [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063) (for osu!mania).

### osu!

Every mapper has heard something along the lines of "stream maps are so lame nowadays" and "every stream map is the same" and "Muya made the best stream map 12 years ago so what's the point".

This contest's theme: **create a stream-focused map.**

There are no strict criteria for what classifies a stream map as *a stream map*, so this aspect will be evaluated by our judging panel! More specifically, the "theme" category in judging will encompass how stream-focused your map is and how fun/creative your streams are.

That said, if your plan was to submit a map that's not obviously stream-focused, you're guaranteed to lose. Make your intention clear!

### osu!mania

Little John was given the worst possible keyboard known to mankind. As such, Little John's keyboard only has access to 2-key rollover, and has been having trouble finding beatmaps that he's able to play. This month's restriction aims to give Little John a chance to play some charts! To make things even simpler, he only plays 4-key sets, unfortunately.

His big brother, Maurice, also wanted to give the contest a shot. His case isn't any better however, and Maurice only has 3-key rollover on his keyboard. Moreover, he only likes playing 7-key beatmaps.

This contest's limitations:

- **4K maps must not have more than two objects pressed at the same time**
- **7K maps must not have more than three objects pressed at the same time**

Thankfully, this pair of brothers isn't too picky. They're fine with streams, jumpstreams, and any other pattern than he can reliably play in (probably) the world's worst keyboards. Judges will be in charge of evaluating how creative of an approach is taken when tackling down his gauntlet!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation/theme](#beatmapping):**
  - **osu!:** create a stream-focused map
  - **osu!mania:**
    - **4K maps** must not have more than two objects pressed at the same time
