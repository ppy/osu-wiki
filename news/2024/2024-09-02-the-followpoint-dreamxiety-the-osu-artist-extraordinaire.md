The Followpoint is back with another interview! This time it will be very artistic so to say.

What's this? A new interview from The Followpoint? That's right, today we are back with [Dreamxiety](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233). You may know her for creating artworks for the seasonal art contests, and you've probably seen them in the main menu whenever you load up osu!, if you have them enabled that is...

Anyway, let's get right into it!

Hey there! Let's start with an introduction, how would you introduce yourself to the people who don't know you?

Hello, I'm Dreamxiety and I like drawing stuff for osu seasonal backgrounds! I've provided art for quite a long time and you've likely seen my art at this point, but if you're curious feel free to check my profile. My most recent featured art at the time of writing this is the one with balloons from [Aerial Antics Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/215), which you can use as your profile banner for free for a limited time.

How did you get introduced to osu!, and what was your first impression of it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

Maybe tmi but completely honest answer; my crush on 9th grade played it so I downloaded it too so I could play with him. Back then I knew nothing about anime or things like that, so it was kinda weird seeing most songs in the game be Japanese songs.

I also thought it was really weird that even English songs have completely unrelated anime girl backgrounds. Obviously I'm now used to it and osu! was actually the main thing that exposed me to more anime and overall Japanese related things, although I'm still not an anime watcher type of person to this day.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

What made you want to do art in the first place?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I don't know, it's just something I did when I was a child and I never stopped since then. Many children like drawing but drop it as they grow up, but I didn't. I was maybe like 3 or 4 when I started and I just kept going.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

What is your drawing process like? Is there a certain workflow you follow when working on each project, or does each project have a different process?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

If I'm looking for ideas, I'll browse through the internet to find inspirations. For osu! contests specifically, I often just search for art that has the theme. It's a pretty good method since what comes at the top of the search are the things people generally find appealing, and what people have in mind when the name of the theme comes up.

Then I'll look for references, mainly for the things I'm not sure how to draw. Sometimes I also would use other images as placeholders for the background, like the sky for example. I'll adjust the colors and position, it helps me find what I'm trying to go for.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Let's talk about osu!'s seasonal art contests. What made you interested back when you participated for the first time?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I remember that I was opening the osu! homepage and I saw the announcement for [2019 Halloween Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/81). Previously, I had no idea that osu! even hosts that so it was a surprise and I was hyped. I joined not expecting to get in but surprisingly I did and I was really happy.

That was also the first time I got my osu!supporter tag, which I thought was cool. Back then I've never got to enjoy any sort of paid perks in a game because I was just a broke student and my parents aren't a fan of that kinda stuff lol.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

In 2022, you won every single seasonal osu! art contest with no other submissions coming close to your vote count. Do you feel like it could be possible for anyone to achieve this feat in the future?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I guess anything is possible, although I wouldn't recommend trying to stay at the top for too long. Ever since I achieved that I've been staying lowkey in art contests for that reason. I just join more casually and don't even tell people that I joined.

Out of all of the osu! seasonal art contests, what is your favorite art piece you've made?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

Possibly the New Beginnings entry. Many people liked it and I like it too.

What made you like your New Beginnings entry so much, and what made it stand out to you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I think the overall vibe it has just looks the best, it's might be the prettiest entry I've made although that's subjective. I liked that big osu hitcircle fireworks and the little images on the lanterns.

Have you ever had a project that made you burnt out during or after the project, and how do you deal with burnout?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I haven't had any artblocks in quite a long time... Probably because I've also been drawing less than I used to. I do remember experiencing it a long time ago and I don't remember how exactly it went away, it just did with time.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

Who is your favorite osu! mascot to draw?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

Pippi, no question.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

The world cup originals are nowadays introduced with animations using art assets that you provided in 2023. What's the story behind those?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I was approached by [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718), asking me if I'm interested in doing world cup assets. I thought it was a pretty crazy thing to even get asked that and I was excited, so I accepted it. It's still crazy how much I've been involved in providing assets for this game, I never would've expected this to happen.

[Frost Walker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202823#fruits/4662299), the Grand Finals tiebreaker for the osu!catch World Cup 2024, was one of this year's larger projects. Do you have any interesting moments to share or thoughts about your involvement in the process?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

That was actually pretty interesting. I chose osu!catch specifically because it's the mode I'm currently playing and I thought it'd be cool for me to provide art assets for it, kinda representing catch players in a way since there's not a lot of people in the community in the first place.

That was my first time doing a collab project with other artists and designers. I don't know if I'm exactly good at communicating with other people so I was nervous, but it actually turned out to be fun. Shoutout to [nepperoni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082924) and [saturn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22001295) for the awesome background art, and [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) for animating and carrying the whole project!

</div>

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Many spheres of the community have people making illustrated art, such as for tournaments, skinning, storyboarding, manga, art contests, music releases, and merchandise. What would you like to see more of regarding art in osu!, and are there avenues you would personally be interested in delving into more?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

Probably anything but manga since I have a dislike towards having to draw many panels, but anything other than that is cool especially if it's an official project.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

Are there any artists in the osu! community that you feel like deserve more attention?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I don't know, I think everyone else does and I don't really wanna single out anyone. There are so many people with crazy skills in the community, who often don't even place that high in the art contests for example. Maybe as an artist, I tend to appreciate art more from the technical skills it took to create them, whereas the average person might not get that and be more interested in whatever they like no matter how simple it is.

It's a valid way to enjoy art either way, but I often see art that required such a crazy amount of skills place so low in the contest and I kinda wish people could appreciate them more.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Utiba.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11354436">Utiba</a></p>

To finish things up, what does the future hold for you? Do you have anything else that you'd like to mention?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dreamxiety.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233">Dreamxiety</a></p>

I'm hoping I could do more stuff for the game, especially for osu! world cups. osu! is one of the only couple of games I actually stayed playing for a long time. Other games I usually just play maybe for a few months at most then I drop them, but osu actually got me to keep coming back. So I think it's nice to put the stuff I do out there for others to look at and enjoy.

My final message would be 1) Play catch, and 2) I like KAITO thighs.
