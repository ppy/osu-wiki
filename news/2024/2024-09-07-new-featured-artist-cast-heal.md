When we asked **cast heal** for some of their achievements and milestones for this article, they responded with "filthy runoff", so that should give you a solid idea of what you're getting into.

**10** melancholic drum and bass tracks are officially part of [**cast heal**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/436), all of which are pre-timed so your impulsive mapping decisions won't be blocked by anything.

Some mappers never quit, and [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) is the best example. He's already ranked 3 maps of **cast heal**'s songs, including this one played at [COE](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2024) earlier this year:
