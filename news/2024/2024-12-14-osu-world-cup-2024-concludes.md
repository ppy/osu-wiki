They've all come so far, but there can only be one champion.

![](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024/img/owc2024-banner.jpg)

History was made last weekend when former victors were challenged on the highest stage of osu! gameplay. Read on for everything about the results, the beatmaps, the people and how it all came together!

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024/img/owc2024-podium.jpg)

Congratulations to ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea for upending the ::{ flag=US }:: United States' 6-year reign, and to ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia for nearly doing the same and taking them to the tiebreaker.

Coming into this tournament, suspicions about the then-current paradigm of U.S. dominance grew ever stronger, especially after last year's extremely close Grand Finals bout between the same finalist teams, where the last match went to both bracket reset and tiebreaker. While some were predicting this outcome as more likely than ever, none would remain unfazed at the moment the turning point actually happened.

## Mappool recap

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-12-14-osu-world-cup-2024-concludes/owc-2024-gf-mappool.png)

The Grand Finals pool had a fair amount of unique (and very difficult!) challenges for the top 3 teams. With a total of four separate osu! originals and some awesome custom maps — alongside a handful of existing maps, the backdrop for the final two matchups was undoubtedly an exciting spectacle to watch.

Headlining the lineup of originals was, no doubt about it, the tiebreaker — [Operation: Zenithfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287992#osu/4881796) by the great [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31). An exciting yet suspenseful track inspired by classical spy film soundtracks, with callbacks both song-wise and GFX-wise to previous works, this amazing song was given to the elite taskforce of [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812), [Sing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3795679), [funny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8473573), [Heilia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9823042) and [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604), their mission being to adapt it to osu!, and be the cherry on top of this year's World Cup. The map features an intense mix of technical elements, as well as a high mechanical barrier, being aim-intensive and requiring a fair amount of stamina and a bit of speed.

You can find a glimpse behind the scenes for the mapping and visuals of this tiebreaker in this video below:

</div>

The three originals in the regular part of the pool were also very much worthy of attention. In the No Mod pool, there were two: [Naples Yellow Mango](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288022#osu/4881869) by [Attoclef](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/451) was a funky, ever-changing song made into an extremely tough gimmick map by the combined efforts of Chinese legends [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699) and [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662). [Corrupted Paywall](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287942#osu/4881677), the frenetic speedcore track by [XH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/452), was adapted by [Cellina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2490770) to be a relentless speed challenge with a good amount of tech added on top. Finally, [XIchedelic Nova Trinity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287963#osu/4881714) was [DJ Genki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/295)'s contribution this year, with an electronic offering equal parts groovy and vibrant, mapped by [Pho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3624692) as a true test of aim and finger control in the Hidden pool.

Some highlights of the other maps include the unexpected appearance of a custom by [elchxyrlia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1722835), more well known as lahphnya or Arles, with their take on [Sky of Twilight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287859#osu/4881501) — the famous Graveyard high-SR mapper making the map in a similarly mechanically intensive way; a map of [Rubik's Cube](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288047#osu/4881933) by the previously mentioned Heilia, a popular song with an adaptation here that the writer of this section can only define as "quite squarey"; and the final map to be mentioned coincides with the final map played in the whole tournament — [unravel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287914#osu/4881614), the famous song made into an insanely hard alt map by [aishiteiru-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10566388).

Thanks for everyone who made the pools possible this year, and we hope to see you next year!

</div>

The United States and Australia faced off once again in the losers' Grand Finals, a rematch of their winners' Semifinals bout. Two weeks ago, the United States won the match 6–4, but Australia would have something to say about that this time around. This match was a back-and-forth slugfest with the best players on each team finding ways to pop off again and again and again in the hardest pool OWC has ever seen.

Things started off relatively predictably, with Australia banning out [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287847#osu/4881475) and [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287988#osu/4881763), while the U.S. banned out [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287978#osu/4881745) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/20949#osu/74684). What wasn't predictable was that after taking the win on [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287643#osu/4880978) by only 127,583 points, Australia also took a first pick break point on the USA's [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288047#osu/4881933) first pick. Australia would go on to have the top team score of the whole weekend, beating both USA and South Korea's scores on the map, with ::{ flag=AU }:: [cyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8195473) top-scoring with a whopping 950,339 points on Hard Rock. The USA then managed to break back on Australia's second pick, [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287942#osu/4881677), with ::{ flag=US }:: [hydrogen bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) and ::{ flag=US }:: [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553) top-scoring the lobby, before losing their own second pick in [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288022#osu/4881869), where three of the players for Australia all outscored the top player from the USA.

Australia then went on to, predictably, win their next pick in [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/988552#osu/2067859), with ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) top-scoring the map on the weekend with 919,384 points. This all meant that, out of the first five picks in the match, the U.S. only took one of them, with Australia starting off 4-1 in this match. This was anything but the predicted start, as Australia was expected to have the advantage on speed and higher-BPM maps throughout the match, with the U.S. being better on gimmick and reading overall. Australia had already taken maps like [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288047#osu/4881933) and [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288022#osu/4881869) away, in theory limiting the pick strategy for USA.

The United States, however, would not be deterred. They went next into [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116399#osu/2332178) where they won with a 403,555 point lead. Australia continued to pick into speed, but as with [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287942#osu/4881677), this strategy began to falter; [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287985#osu/4881760) ended up going the way of the Americans, with ::{ flag=US }:: [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) top-scoring the lobby for the second time with 717,002 points. The Americans then picked into [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287963#osu/4881714) and won there as well, with ::{ flag=US }:: [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) once more top-scoring the lobby alongside ::{ flag=US }:: [tekkito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075211), their captain.

This resulted in a tied game, 4–4, between the two teams. Despite the U.S. being the six-time defending champions, Australia would not be deterred. Even after having just lost on Hidden, they picked into [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287961#osu/4881712) and managed to win by a slim margin, only 145,259 points. The United States, with the pool heavily whittled down, picked [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287973#osu/4881729) next and also won their pick by a slim margin — this time, only 31,077 points!

The match would finish off with another set of traded points. The Aussies took their [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392496#osu/2874944) last pick by virtue of their supporting scores being better, while ::{ flag=US }:: [hydrogen bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) matched ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) and top-scored the lobby, and the Americans took their [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287983#osu/4881757) last pick in much the same way, with ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) top-scoring the lobby with 908,435 points. When the match got to 6–6, only one map remained; it was time for the tiebreaker!

This last map, however, was not where we would see the peak of OWC dominance finally fall. [Operation: Zenithfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287992#osu/4881796) would go to the Americans, with ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) top-scoring the lobby once again but ::{ flag=US }:: [Utami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7512553), ::{ flag=US }:: [hydrogen bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296), and ::{ flag=US }:: [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) all outscoring the second-best score on team Australia. Despite how close this match ended up, with many points traded for both teams and less than a 200,000 score difference, the end result still favoured the reigning champs. For the tenth time in a row, the United States would move on to the Grand Finals to face off against South Korea.

### ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

It was uncharted territory for the South Korean OWC roster. Though they'd played in the past two Grand Finals as the representative from the upper bracket, they had never been the favourites to win, even with the bracket reset advantage in their back pocket. That honour went to the United States, and with good reason: the U.S., after their 2023 triumph, had won eight of the last nine World Cups and were perennial favourites.

2024, though, was different. Coming off their victory in the winners' bracket Final and playing at a level of historical dominance not seen since the famed 2019 USA roster, South Korea had finally flipped the script — the underdogs had become the favourites, with 67% of pick-em participants choosing them to defeat the long-reigning champions, and to take home the titles of osu! Champions themselves.

Finally, match time arrived, and all discussions and analyses were cast aside as the 2024 OWC Grand Final was underway.

The match began with a strong sense of déjà vu. Just as in the winners' Final, South Korea banned two tapping maps (this time [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287985#osu/4881760) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/20949#osu/74684)). Just as in the winners' Final, the United States responded with two gimmick/reading bans with [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288022#osu/4881869) and [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287847#osu/4881475). Just as in the winners' Final, South Korea had the first pick, and just as in the winners final, the USA took a break point on the opening map. In a stunning reversal of fortune from the losers' bracket Final, not only did USA win [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288047#osu/4881933) this time, they went on to take a 4–1 map lead, winning their early picks in [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287942#osu/4881677) and [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287978#osu/4881745) before taking a second break point via a 36,223 point victory on HD3.

Collective déjà vu intensified through 5 maps: the day before, Australia had led the United States by an identical 4–1 score; now it was the United States' turn to hold an early advantage as South Korea was forced to search for some way to turn the tide.

And what a turn it would be.

The United States' next pick was the CS 7.8 [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287973#osu/4881729) pick; led by a 540,581 score from ::{ flag=KR }:: [byeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976), South Korea took its first break point of the match. Next, they decided to stay in the HR pool by picking [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116399#osu/2332178), where it was ::{ flag=KR }:: [fragranceofpage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11399348)'s turn to lead the way for the Koreans with a 671,622 score en route to a victory. Despite an uncertain moment for South Korea following ::{ flag=KR }:: [byeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976) disconnecting on DT4, ::{ flag=KR }:: [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078)'s 731k score led them to another break point, and suddenly the match was tied. South Korea had stolen two break points from the United States, they had grabbed the momentum, and they would not look back.

[NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287939#osu/4881668) was the next pick for South Korea, where a massive 1841 combo from ::{ flag=KR }:: [byeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976) helped secure them another map and a 5–4 lead in the match. The comeback was in full force, and the tables had unequivocally turned.

The United States opted into [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392496#osu/2874944), but it was another fruitless endeavour, as ::{ flag=KR }:: [byeok2044](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8472976) continued to display his incredible level of play by top-scoring it with a 795,672 play, taking a third straight break point and setting up a championship point for South Korea.

Never willing to let the cinematic potential of such a moment go to waste, their selected map was [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287914#osu/4881614), a brutally challenging aim control alt map. South Korea raced to an early advantage and the United States could do nothing but watch their hopes and their dynasty unravel as the map played out. By the time all was said and done, ::{ flag=KR }:: [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) would be atop the map with a 433,888 score, leading his team to victory on the map and with it the tournament.

South Korea had finally done it. The reign of the United States as osu! World Cup champions had come to an end at their hands, and in remarkable fashion: from being down 4–1, the South Korean squad did not drop a single map the rest of the way, taking 6 straight picks to close the match out 7–4. Their performance throughout the 2024 World Cup was equally stunning, dropping just 9 maps to the United States while going undefeated through the rest of the tournament, all with multiple team members near the top of the performance score leaderboard every week. It was a victory for the ages, one which will be etched in the history of the osu! World Cup for all time.

South Korea dropped only nine points in total against only one team, making this the second most dominant win of any team in OWC history, statistically speaking. Do you feel that South Korea's performance in matches this year were as dominant as this stat implies?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FlyingTuna.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078">FlyingTuna</a></p>

Yes, I think our performance was outstanding. Honestly, I believe we could have won without giving up many points even against USA, but the pressure of playing against them was much bigger than we expected, which led us to giving them some breakpoints

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/dio.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

How much do you consider tryouts when forming the roster as opposed to tournament performance throughout the year? How about the previous year's OWC performance?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FlyingTuna.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078">FlyingTuna</a></p>

Last year, our main focus was on whether we could compete skillsets like speed and mechanics which favor USA when we face them in the later rounds.

However, this year, instead of focusing on skillsets that favor USA, we decided to focus on skillsets that we are good at (like tech, alt, hidden, gimmick) and just give up on speed.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/dio.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

You have [Nopekjk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4585186) listed as an analyst on your team collab, and [Allegrissimo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9052194) shouted him out with smoke writing during the TB showcase. What was his role this year as an analyst and past player for OWC South Korea?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FlyingTuna.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078">FlyingTuna</a></p>

Yes, Nopekjk was our analyst. Throughout the whole OWC he would analyze the scores that the opponents would get on each map of each stage and would help us with pick and ban whilst also encouraging us and supporting us mentally.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/dio.jpg')"></a>

The Grand Final had a turning point when South Korea was down 4–1 early on. How did your team react, and what changed in order for you to win?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FlyingTuna.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078">FlyingTuna</a></p>

My team and I, we all took it calmly as we had the bracket reset in mind. Because no matter what happens in the first part, even if we fail we had that 1 more chance. So we all remained calm and positive and even if we were down 4-1 we were just as confident and strong as ever because we are used to reverse sweeping.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/dio.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619">D I O</a></p>

South Korea finished in the top 4 eight times since 2014, top 3 five times since 2016, and second in 2019, 2022, and 2023. What does it mean for you to finally get the win this year?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FlyingTuna.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078">FlyingTuna</a></p>

To be honest I can't really express my emotions enough with just words. I am so overjoyed and happy that this happened after everything we as a team have been through. This means so much not just to the 2024 roster players but also to past roster players who have been cheering and supporting us throughout all this time. It is definitely one of the greatest things in my life and I will cherish it always.

Hi, thanks for having me! I go by AlexDunk, originally an osu!mania player and mapper at heart. But now I'm slowly transitioning to be doing graphic design for song backgrounds! I have always been enjoying making beatmap backgrounds for songs, and the background images of all of my uploaded maps since 2019 are edited through Photoshop, so being able to join the World Cup design team for the same objectives is honestly such a honor. My goal is to keep making bigger and more awesome works that people enjoy to look at, and at the same time mayyybe inspire people too to start their own creative hobby and just simply doing awesome things!

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799">AlexDunk</a></p>

Honest answer is, I love every work I've put out so far. Though [LIGHT LEFT BEHIND](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062241) will always have a special spot in my heart, during July 2023 I have the luckiest moment of my life, to be commissioned by [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) to make a custom background for this osu! original by [BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38), as my first art debut to quite a big scale of audience. I have been a fan of his songs for so long, so to be given an opportunity to do this while I was pretty much an unknown in the GFX sphere was beyond unthinkable.

To showcase my commitment to this project, I decided to implement Blender (A popular 3D software) for the first time in my background art design. It turned out amazing and I'm still really proud of it.

Other than that, the CWC 2024 Grand Finals tiebreaker: [Frost Walker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202823) by [Kou!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/383) is such an enormous production from start to finish. I am very grateful to even be able to be part of it and contribute to this project (Big shout out to [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) and the illustrators involved ([Dreamxiety](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233), [Saturn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22001295), [Nepperoni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082924)) for the carry).

I remember my journey into GFX began in 2018, back when I was still deeply obsessed with grinding osu!mania ranks. One day I stumbled upon a [beatmap for "Light It Up"](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/455164) by [Hiranaka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4207811) and was immediately captivated by the typography and the overall mood of the background. Its simplicity perfectly complemented the song, inspiring me to create something similar for my own maps.

That moment sparked my interest in GFX, starting with basic text overlays and gradually evolving into adding effects, crafting detailed typography, and eventually producing full-fledged Photoshop artworks. Today, I have the privilege of collaborating with talented individuals who share my passion, working on projects I could never have imagined when I first began this journey.

Working with artists on a design project is new to me too. I've only grown comfortable with it after participating collabs time and time again. Obviously you would want to make sure you have active presence, sharing your thoughts / ideas together with the team, but in the end it still comes down to two things (let's assume you are a GFX artist working with illustrator(s)):

1. Your contribution to the final work: Be proactive and ensure your input is valuable. Collaborate openly, but don't hesitate to take initiative—your unique touch as a GFX artist matters. Strive to leave a mark that aligns with the team's vision.
2. Keep time constraint in mind, plan things out and finish them bit by bit. Break tasks into manageable parts and stick to a timeline to avoid rushing. Consistent progress ensures you deliver quality work without compromising the team's overall flow.

Doing and learning at the same time will always push you further.

Aside from creating background artworks for this year's World Cups, I've also ventured into smaller regional tournaments. A standout example of my GFX contribution is the Grand Finals tiebreaker for [MCNC 7K 2024](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1846778?n=1): [Chong Xiao - The Multitude of Empyrean](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2133204).

Looking ahead, I'm excited to take on the responsibilities of making main design for the World Cups 2025, working alongside the talented illustrator [Pineapple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326)—whom I admire as their #1 fan. This marks my first time designing for tournaments on this scale, but I'm committed to delivering a presentation worthy of such an event.

While I can't reveal more projects of what I have been busy with just yet, please stay tuned for the upcoming designs. And I promise, they are going to be bangers.

This year, he composed *Operation: Zenithfall* for the osu! World Cup's [Grand Finals tiebreaker beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287992).

How would you describe the concept or inspirations behind *Operation: Zenithfall*?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

"Operation: Zenithfall" was created as the track for the tournament's - OWC2024 - absolute finale. The theme is, very coincidentally, based on the idea of "overturning the top - Zenith", expressing the players' challenges and the drama of turning the tables through music. This track was not only to capture intensity and epicness, but also to deliver a unique experience unlike any other song.

During the brainstorming with concept idea process, I thought, "What if the theme were about carrying out a mission as a member of a secret, covert organization?" By aligning that concept with the players' experience, especially for the attendees/players of the tournament, I decided to incorporate that idea into the music in a curveball way. So I drew inspiration from the iconic sounds of spy films, particularly elements reminiscent of 007. This style of music is rarely heard in the rhythm game scene, so I believe it brings a refreshing and entertaining quality.

As a result, and thanks to other people who did their best jobs to make this song more elaborate than no one ever expected, I believe it became more than just a track, it's a work that combines storytelling and originality. I hope it serves as a new way to conclude the climax of the tournament, and enhance the players' experience.

Players likely remember your last osu! World Cup track *ΩΩPARTS* as the predecessor to hundreds of bespoke songs in osu! tournaments. Do you have thoughts to share regarding its conception?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Camellia.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31">Camellia</a></p>

"ΩΩPARTS" was created as the very first tiebreaker track for the osu! World Cup, and it holds a special place in my heart. This track was not only a first for me but also, as far as I know, the first time osu! had ever tried something like this.

As a concept, I wanted to evoke the sense of an unknown threat, something mysterious and potentially ominous, which I believe the "OOPARTS - Out-of-place-artifacts", like such as the Antikitira Machine or Voynich Manuscript, represents very well. Additionally, since initially I wanted to include this track in the "U.U.F.O." album, I leaned into themes like urban legends, enigmatic ideas, or even simply featuring mysterious objects. These elements naturally shaped the track into what it ultimately became.

I still vividly remember the excitement and honor I felt when the track was actually played as a tiebreaker in the tournament - it was a very intense and exciting moment for me, and hopefully for the most other people watching, or playing, too. It's absolutely honorful to see that people still love the track with passion, and I believe it's genuinely from the magic that the rhythm games have.

What makes me even happier is how this track became the starting point for a tradition of original songs being created for osu! tournaments. The fact that history has been shaped, even in a small way, by something I created is an incredible honor, and I'm proud to have been part of that journey. It's truly amazing to see how far things and other artists' works have come since then, and I'm thankful to have had the chance to contribute to it.

Many of your music releases are considered "boss songs" in a variety of rhythm games. When starting out, what did your relationship with the rhythm game sphere look like, and did you ever envision it as it is today?

When I first became involved with the rhythm game sphere - it was an arcade rhythm game title SOUND VOLTEX by KONAMI - it was simply a way for me to share my music, and share my love and creation. I was already a huge fan of rhythm games as a player, completely obsessed with their fun, but I never imagined that my tracks would someday be regarded as "boss songs" within them.

In the beginning, I focused on creating music that expressed my favorite genres and styles, enjoying the process of seeing how my work would be used in games and received by players.

But over time, I began to embrace the idea of "creating music that enhances the gameplay experience," consciously incorporating intense rhythm parts and challenging elements unique to rhythm games. As a result, I'm incredibly happy that many players have enjoyed my music, and that it's often recognized as "boss songs" as their biggest challenges. I could never have dreamed of becoming as deeply involved with the rhythm game community as I am today, but it has been one of the greatest joys and honors of my career.

Is there a story behind your fedora?

Nowadays, it's not just something I wear on stage - it's become a part of me, completely, like glasses. Thanks to that, many people remember me as "the guy with the fedora", and I really like that! These days, I almost never leave the house without a hat, and honestly, the idea of going out without one is getting a bit scary - like I feel like being naked...

Even people who have never met me in person recognize me by my hairstyle, glasses, and, of course, this fedora, which makes meeting up incredibly easy. It's also not uncommon for people to spot me in real life and ask, "Are you Camellia?". That's insane!

Do you have any general thoughts to share about this project and the people you've been working with?

The people I've been working with are incredibly talented, passionate, and extremely kind to me and everyone. Every time I get to experience their energy and creativity, it inspires me a lot. Additionally, I'm so happy to be back here after four years. Though I've worked with mania, taiko and catch mode tournaments too, seeing people getting happy that I'm back is amazing.

While working on the music, I was able to incorporate their feedback and ideas, which I believe made the final product even better. I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone involved, players participating in the tournament, organizers, staff, and everyone else who contributed. Thanks to all your efforts and support, this project has come to life. It was absolute cinema!

And, by the way, this message will self-destruct in 5 seconds.
