The beach, a tall drink, and a new release of Project Loved. Sounds like paradise, doesn't it?

Welcome back to another edition of Project Loved! Summer is now in full swing, but worry not, we are back once again with fresh Project Loved picks that perfectly serve as refreshers.

151 BPM, 1:57 | 7.47★\
*description written by [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656)*

Hey guys, just woke up from my hyperbolic time chamber of 6 months to submit the bi-yearly [Akali](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2127359) map towards the Loved quota.

This month's first *Popular Playcounts* pick is none other than your favourite player's favourite mapper [Akali](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2127359) giving his spin on [lapix's *Debug Dance*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/733559#osu/1548125). Quite literally self-defining an entire new skillset genre in alt-tech, this 7.5★ 2-minute aim control Armageddon of a map satisfies your favourite [osu! clip farmer's YouTube shorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcTc0E9yHgs) revenue for the day.

Vote yes..... please..... WE NEED.... THE FLOW ALT DOPAMINE....

[Various Nightcore - rezoons' Jump Training #2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/968222#osu) by rezoons\
143.37 – 215 BPM, 2:32 | 4.07★ – 6.74★\
*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The second *Popular Playcount* for this month is one of the most iconic jump training sets in the entire game, [rezoons' Jump Training #2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/968222#osu/2026037).

If you've been around osu! in the past \~10 years there's no doubt you haven't stumbled upon this jump training set. With likely a combined 10+ million playcount over the years, this is absolutely an all-timer. This set includes: Feeling So Blue (**4.07★**), Cambodia (**4.72★**), Just For You (**5.07★**), Colors Of The Rainbow (**5.14★**), Oh Baby (**5.58★**), We Go Down (**6.05★**), Fuck You (**6.74★**) a nice range of difficulties for the masses, *almost* everyone gets to enjoy something from this set.

Why #2 instead of #1 you might ask? Well, the playcount difference says it all. That doesn't mean #1 won't be put up for Loved in the near future though. Stay tuned.

216 BPM, 3:35 | 6.51★, 6.51★\
*description written by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

For this month's *Outstanding Oldies*... Raw streams.

Get ready to scream as you face [Vuelo Eluko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3372828)'s map of [All That Remains - This Calling](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/304439#osu). There may be a slight dose of symmetrical jumps as well, just as you'd expect from a classic. This beatmap has garnered the attention of players throughout the years, being yet, another staple multiplayer pick and "stream practice" map. That's not without reason, as the simplicity of the map makes it extremely fun to play through over and over. You can also choose between AR 9 or 10, whichever feels most comfortable to you. Now isn't that convenient?

For this month's *small spectacles* pick we'll be featuring [monolithize phases](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/600736#osu/2044749).

[Deramok](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1428455) is no stranger to the Loved section, with his aesthetic style and infamous overlap-centric gameplay standing out amongst your typical beatmaps. This map is no exception, sitting at over 6 minutes, 6.54★, and chock-full of all those patterns that make most HR players cry themselves to sleep.

If you want to compete on this monster of a beatmap, you know exactly what to do to that yes voting button.

The *Daredevil Difficulty* for this month is [BarkingMadDog](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3475189)'s map of [OSTER Project feat. Nanahira - Napo Napo Ritaan Macchi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/739053#osu).

Ah... The sight of seeing more [BarkingMadDog](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3475189) (BMD) maps being put up for Loved, so elegant, isn't it?

This might be one of the most "tame" BMD maps you'd ever see, jumps, jumps, and more jumps. The song calls for it. **6.9★**, NM1 style, nearly 4 minutes of a pure raw aim consistency test — if you're able to FC this I consider you to be a strong aim player. 100,000+ playcount and 240+ favorites definitely make this have a place in Loved.

You have the choice to make this map have a leaderboard. Vote now!

This month's *Ranked Rejects* pick is [Yoshimaro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3823413)'s mapset of [USAO - Knight Rider](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1074903#osu).

This mapset was first submitted in 2019, and since then it has racked up over 50,000 playcount and 100 favorites. Although, it was never quite able to make it to the ranked section, it easily deserves its place in Loved. This set features a five-difficulty spread (including a guest difficulty from [Cubby](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10914582)!) ranging from **2.5★** to **7.2★**, so players of almost any skill level can find a suitable challenge. Paired with a classic, high-intensity banger from USAO, you get a set that is most aptly described as pure unadulterated fun.

If you want to make sure this set finally gets a home, make sure to vote now!

For this month's *Gameplay Gimmicks*, we have [t+pazolite - You Are The Miserable](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1701523#osu) mapped by [Drimm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4488808)!

This sinister-sounding piece by one of osu!'s most recognizable J-Core artists features a lot of aim control as well as flow and of course, the deciding factor for the category, 2B! These tricky 2B slider patterns will force you into paying a lot more attention and hitting all the slider ends in the correct order in order to get the highest accuracy possible, creating one of the most mechanically demanding 2B maps I've ever seen. The mapper's personal best is 96% and [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905)'s is [97.87%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WfzekE8vqY) — the bar has been set for you to beat!

Scientists have recently discovered that not voting for this in Loved results in you feeling miserable, so go fix it!

You may know [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917) from his mapping contributions to the osu! World Cup like [Hitori no Yoru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1296252#osu/2689473), or perhaps if you're more cultured, some of his finer works in Loved like [History Maker (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/648310#osu/1373482). We're here to shine a spotlight on another... *similar* type of map 6 years later for this month's *Meme Monstrosities*! Featuring everything you could ever want out of a map including: speed, aim, tech, variable bpm, you name it; this map delivers on it and plenty more that you didn't ask for. Hold on, I'm getting a little thirsty, let me take a swig of this unsuspecting clear liquid.

It's back. [Super Driver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1334617) is back.

This map has been denied a home time and time again, in both Ranked and Loved. Its last failure in Loved voting would've passed with the recent threshold change from 85% -> 80%. With the recent veto in Ranked guaranteeing its barred entry, I believe it is time for *Super Driver* to return.

She deserves a home, so vote yes if you wish to see it in Project Loved!

If this month's Loved picks have you as excited as I am, you can wind down with this month's *Chill Champions* pick [After The Rain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/841259#osu/1760614)!

Although the top difficulty sits at only 4.08★, [Striderin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10193902) is able to offer eccentric playfield usage, uncommon difficulty settings, and of course a cute song to keep you vibing! Make sure to check out the easier Hard difficulty if you're looking for an experience more tailored to novices.

If you enjoyed this pick, make sure to hit that yes button for this month's Loved voting! Are you really gonna say no to that cute little octopus in the background??? Don't hurt its feelings...

With almost 150 seconds of pure, nonstop 270 BPM breakcore shred, [xidorn Akutami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7904667) calls upon only the greatest ~~cursed~~ tapping techniques to be in play. Created for the [osu!content NM5 GF Incident](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1337855?n=1), make sure you bring your [cursed tools](https://wooting.io/wooting-60he%20) because maybe only then you'll be able to challenge [The Fastest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th0JE0MwWwI).

Are you the fastest because you can play this map? Or can you play this map because you're the fastest?

*We Hate Touhou*. That's why we're putting this up for Loved.

Jokes aside... We all love *Touhou* here at Project Loved.

This breakcore remix of *Youkai Temple* is unrelenting. 250 BPM, **8.61★** top diff, littered with cross-screen jumps, streams, bursts, and triples, this is an absolute demon of a map. The LUNATIC difficulty is just a more nerfed aim version of the top difficulty, if the aim is too hard for you, sitting at **8.03★**. There's also a GD by [Akali](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2127359) that's a more tapping-focused map, at **7.08★**. This mapset has gathered 75,000+ plays and 120+ favorites over the years. That definitely proves to me this has its place in the Loved section.

Wait... [kuyusu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11758667) and [Raijodo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13400075)... We could totally use [Meiteki Cybernetics](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1317461#osu/2729687), right? The map has crazy fun patterning, it's a great song, and it's super intuitive for players. These mappers legit never miss. It's perfect for this pool. Hi, you reading this right now, can you testplay this map? Vote "YES" if you'd like to see this in the pool and vote "NO" otherwise.

When you combine enjoyable patterns with engaging SV, you get a great map. Add in exciting visual gimmicks, and you get this [layxa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14800030) map.

This map of [ReeK - Mo-no/liTH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1871628) is a masterpiece paired with an equally interesting song with plenty of changes in pace characteristic of ReeK's music, which layxa fully captures with their full array of innovative barline gimmicks. For those who prefer a simpler experience, fret not as there is also a No Gimmick diff which lets players enjoy bashing the drums to an intense 261 BPM track without overheating their GPUs.

Give this map a try and show it the love it deserves!

With katagiri and KTYN maps being no stranger to taiko or Loved, it is easy to see why this map has kept its popularity for all this time. *L4.8TS* is a 228 BPM 1/6-filled consistency map, fitting 2100 notes into 3:27 minutes worth of map, barely giving players the chance to stop with only a few small rest moments and one short break in the middle of the map. This is not a bad thing though, as *L4.8TS* is mapped incredibly well and is a pleasure to play throughout!

For those looking to practise their stamina or especially their 1/6 skills, *L4.8TS* is a perfect map to practise. If you're looking for a really fun map and beautiful song, look no further!

There are ranked mapsets that barely reach a play count higher than 5K, and yet [MOSAIC.WAV - Chousai Kenbo Sengen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/469296#taiko) by [Cihyaa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1282954) (a.k.a. Coin) manages to surpass that amount with aplomb. Featured in countless tournaments, whether big or small, and played hundreds of times in multiplayer lobbies throughout the years, this mapset has survived the test of time and continues to be relevant to this day. A classic stream-heavy map with a rated diff for the more skilled, *Chousai Kenbo Sengen* offers replayability not seen in many maps. And if you haven't tried it out yet, this will most likely become a map you come back often to.

We at Taiko Loved HQ are ashamed to have taken this long to feature this map. But as they say, it's better late than never. As always, the community has the last say on these matters. So go ahead, try it out if you haven't, and show your support if you so wish!

[NEUROTYPICAL SYSTEM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1734223#taiko) rockets into the Loved voting this month by esteemed mapper [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)! You might know of *breakchild* already, but if you haven't, then why not jump into their amazing music with this map from the [osu!taiko World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2022)? It's full of tricky fast-paced patterns ready to challenge those who dare to give it a shot. Definitely befitting of a Semifinals tiebreaker!

Give it a shot and let us know what you think!

Being 300 BPM and 8.2★, most players should know what they are in for from these numbers alone. *A flying Dance Hall*'s kiais are filled with 15-note streams, especially in the final two kiais where the density really ramps up! There are even a few 30-note streams and an absolutely brutal 60-note stream to finish the map! For those who read all of this and thought "300 BPM, that's it?", you're in luck! There are also 315 and 330 BPM rate-changed difficulties available for the speed-obsessed and those looking to push their fingers to the limits.

Are you fast enough? Give it a go and see!

If there were a "guilty pleasures" category of SVs, this would be part of it.

[shenglinnn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10286018)'s *INTERNET YAMERO* is an intriguing mix of modern SV execution and old-school experience. Despite being made in 2023, I think it conceptually plays like 2017–2018'ish SV. The map lends itself to be enjoyed casually: a mix of friendly patterning and a simplistic approach with somewhat physical tendencies will remind people of some old-school reading-oriented classics.

Allegedly, the technical SV approach was borrowed from [H1Pur](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15756120), a recent yet mainstay name of normalized but impactful reading SVs. Here's a secret from another SV mapper's perspective: we honestly just copy and paste values and transitions we're used to working with, and it actually works most of the time! SV mapping really doesn't have to be complicated to be enjoyable, which is incidentally why simplistic but effective approaches end up as the most popular types of maps in the end.

A bit of an odd tangent, but I feel like modern streaming is coming somewhat close to a convoluted game of Tamagotchi. If you've played *NEEDY STREAMER OVERLOAD*, you probably understand where I'm coming from, and while that game's message and execution are largely exaggerated, I do think that what goes behind the scenes of streaming is often underrated, especially in terms of mental health. Feel free to discuss further in the voting thread... or don't, and just drop a vote and lurk!

*description written by [YuEast 2018](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13953619)*

Introducing [My Angel Koishi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8273098) for their second osu!mania Loved pick with [katagiri - ch3rry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1367260#mania/2827582) after 2 years!

[My Angel Koishi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8273098)'s [ch3rry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1367260#mania/2827582) is one of their most popular files, and it is no surprise to see that. It definitely has a lot of patterns that are very accessible to many players, such as chordjacks, and jumpstreams. Having this kind of charting can make newer players more accustomed to the more difficult patterns that they'll eventually have to play.

You can notice that the chordjacks are mapped more in the non-kiai sections, while jumpstreams are more evident in the different chorus sections of this file. What's also good about this map is how seamless the transitions from chordjacks to jumpstreams are executed, wherein they aren't too sudden, and still give you some ample time to recover in order for you to have your hands adjusted to playing those different patterns.

However, just because the patterning might not be the most difficult, it does not mean that the chart is going to be easy to play. Considering that most of the file tests how consistent you can be, it could give you some trouble if you come unprepared, especially if your fatigue eventually runs out. Not to mention, having to play chordjacks and then jumpstreams repeatedly for around 3 minutes can also lead you to mindblock this file, which is not something you'd want to have especially if you are very susceptible to having them.

If 1.0x is not enough for you, then you're in luck, as rates up to 1.45x are provided, and I am sure that a large chunk of the playerbase can certainly play up to that rate. From 205 BPM to 297 BPM, it certainly has a lot of BPMs to offer, to ensure that anyone of any skill level can have fun with such a file.

Overall, this is a chart that really encapsulates two of the most beginner-friendly patterning for 4K maps, which would be chordjacks, and jumpstreams/handstreams. Do you like these kinds of maps? Or how about the Sar4CORE series that [My Angel Koishi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8273098) has? Then don't forget to give it a vote!

In the effort of being more even with the difficulty of chordjack maps that are Loved this month, we see the return of [LaoXiao-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2393571) for the first time in a few years with [Haruka by YAOSOBI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1398827#mania/2886201).

This chart is quite a bit different than the now famous [Sendan Life](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1170842#mania/2442466) initially because of the 30 BPM decrease in speed, which is so much more than what it sounds. However, there is also the difference of bigger emphasis on one-note anchors which that between fingers. In addition, if you are struggling with the density that the Moment difficulty has, you have the option of playing the FolAH's Reminiscence difficulty. This difficulty has the same main gimmick of anchory jack, although there is a slight decrease in the density that appears.

If you are looking for more chordjack maps to play and are just getting into the stride of these kinds of maps, be sure to give *Haruka* a play and vote "yes" in the poll!

It's been a good while since we've seen [Pope Gadget](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341) anywhere, and we're glad to say that he's back with his chart of [Reap What You Sow](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1828397#mania)!

Made as a custom for [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K), it ended up being used in the Finals mappool on 1.05x as a miscellaneous pick. You might look at this and think to yourself that it's more fitting for speed due to how prominent the single streams are, but don't be fooled!

This song is a live performance, meaning that the BPM is variable, causing some slight changes in snaps due to how constant the tempo changes are. A good example is the guitar solo halfway through. The section only uses 1/8 snaps, but due to the mentioned BPM changes, it feels like you're constantly changing the speed at which you're hitting the notes. Even then, the column usage in this section has extreme attention to detail in how it plays, giving you more roll-y patterns for sustained sounds, and tougher anchors for the "freestyle" sounds.

As for the streams in the kiais, you've got... um... something? Due to this being charted in arrowvortex, the snaps aren't exactly clear, but it's approximated to be 1/10th streams. That's fast! It would be much harder, if it weren't for short breaks between each burst.

All in all, the complexity behind this chart is not something to scoff at, and is definitely no joke for those looking for something exceptionally hard. Go give this huge standout of a chart your vote!

This one's an oldie, but very much a goodie! [Arise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5127544), or better known as "Xcaliboor" at the time, is seeing their second nomination, this time being [The Lightning Sword](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/462812#mania/991122)!

The skill of players has increased significantly since 2016, and back then, you had people playing this chart due to the sheer difficulty it offered for players at the time. A great amount of people were playing it during this period, such as [inteliser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GidXdpRhH4o), [SuddenDeath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJTOE3h5OTo), and [AFOTHER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ism1a9Ubs) all setting good scores on it. Obviously, it didn't stop at them, but these scores (especially inteliser's) were the most notable for the time period.

Jumpstream may be hard to comment on, but the chart manages to stick out due to how it doesn't use triples for the hardest parts. It still has an old-style feel to it though, as there are a few splittrills into triples at calmer parts, but what's a legacy chart without that?

It's safe to say that today's top players have significantly progressed past this level of difficulty, but that's not to say it's easy to play for everyone! If you have any doubts, then you're encouraged to play this and see how well you hold up. Now go on and vote to return the legacy this chart once had!

Well-known long note charter [chxu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13712190) is finally making their appearance in Loved, and there's no better way to introduce them than with [Get Crunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1876516#mania/3861846)!

Some interesting trivia about this chart is that it was originally a hybrid, but was eventually reworked to be a long note chart for [Speed of Light 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1686361?n=1), ending up in the Finals mappool. The song choice was also an added benefit, since not only is it good, but it was also used in [Japan's 2022 MWC Roster Reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7dwRKrNgME), which is where the idea for the chart came into existence in the first place!

All that talk, but what about the chart itself? To put it simply, it's got it all. Each section of the song leads to different patterns, while keeping a constant usage of shields throughout. Some sections are pure density, some are trickier on releases, and some are heavier with snaps, using 1/6, 1/8, and sometimes even 1/16 snaps! Definitely not something you see very often, especially when used in a more technical sense like this.

If you're looking for more unique charts that defy what you'd normally see a long note approach for, whether it's song choice or pattern choice, don't sleep on this one! Give this one a shot!

If you've seen the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K) Grand Finals showcase stream, this map surely stuck in your mind with the amazing reception that it had! For this opportunity we want to present you [Minerva](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1939250#mania/4009321) as the featured Grand Finals tech pick!

Minerva contains everything that you would expect from a map that causes impressive reactions from the audience, starting from abrasive dump delays right off the bat, combined with a lot of technical jacks and anchor trill patterns that demand a lot of physicality, stamina and coordination to pull off properly. All of those challenges also require the player to hit dense layering through the unstable snapping mixture, which brings deeper nuance to the music, but requires more precision that tests your finger's flexibility and experience through these unusual and uncommon patterns.

This type of map is a rare sight in Loved, especially for gamma+ level technical picks, but we do think that it brings something new to play and certainly will be a true test for rice players as well!

Don't hesitate to show your support for this map and cast your vote to bring it to the place that it deserves!

Unlike previous 6K packs, this time we are nominating a pack that is more focused on LN patterns and styles. [xfpsb 6K LN Kaleidoscope Collection](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2204252) is a pack created by many experienced LN mappers and players. It's the combination of [Volume 1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1565028) and [Volume 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1922362) and contains various kinds of LN patterns, such as LN release, coordination, density and mixed LN. This pack also covers various difficulties with difficulty names accurately denoting the map's difficulty. Guaranteed a good experience for the vast majority of players!

[Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881) once again returns to the Loved scene with the 7K chart of [linear ring with RNAcid - Gypsophila](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1715584#mania/3568135)!

The chart starts with a structure that utilizes the vocals in a dump style, and as the music flows, the complex stream-style delay starts to emerge. The minijacks are well placed, accentuating the deep sounds unique to linear ring. The complex techy patterns also bring a different level of nuance to the map.

The chart starts at 151 BPM, but it has rates going up to 1.45x (219 BPM), testing the skill and limits of all players. Personally, I wonder if the feeling of the chart is maintained as the rate goes up. This chart gives you the satisfying experience of comfortable flowing dump.

The cocoon st2 (now named st0) version was used as the Quarterfinals speed pick in [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K). The 1.2x difficulty rate also got used, this time as the Semifinals FM1 speed pick in [7K ETT](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1506203?n=1), further exemplifying the chart's popularity with an appearance in one of the biggest community tournaments in the mania scene!

On this opportunity, we want to introduce you to this infamous map by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750), which garnered a lot of plays and attention, as an extra pick!

The map itself features dense chordstream paired with really dense burst alongside several LN density sections that require a specific skillset to pull off properly. Not to mention, you need to prepare for high-speed bump SV that feels like it crashed directly through you! The SV requires some memorization, but since the overall patterns are more straightforward, they accommodate the map suitably.

The patterns of this map are clean and well-planned by none other than the seasoned 7K mapper \_underjoy himself. We certainly do not do this very often, so please show your support by casting a favorable vote for this map!
