Tune in for your latest non-pp-related osu!(lazer) updates!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-09-osulazer-updates-october-9/banner.jpg)

If you were waiting for news regarding performance points (pp), there is one thing. It's that new changes are live, but only in lazer and not on the website or stable. More detailed news explaining the changes will follow later.

However, while the developers are working out the kinks and preparing for a server-side release of the new pp rework (which you can learn about in the video below), they've also been busy with other aspects of osu!(lazer) (which you can also learn about in the video below):

## Editor changes

- **The editor setup screen has been completely redesigned.** The setup screen has been rebuilt from the ground up to reorganise all the options and hopefully look better at the same time.

</div>

- **Objects can now be added to an existing selection when control-clicking them, and the selected hit objects can be scaled around the selection box centre.** Another set of smaller, intuitive updates that will make mappers' lives easier.

</div>

- **A new grid placement tool has been added.** Next to that, the rotate and flip commands will take into account the centre of the newly placed grid, and grids can be centred around specific hit objects.

- **Hotkey hints have been added across editor menus.** Very helpful for aspiring mappers.

## Skinning changes

- **The avatar skin component is has been improved.** Next to being able to round the edges, you can now change the aspect ratio of the element, and the avatar will automatically adapt to the new ratio.
- **Certain elements can now have their colour customised.** The default and argon song progress bar, font adjustable components, argon wedge piece and the box element all now have adjustable colours, with more to follow at some point.

## Other changes

- **It's now easier to differentiate osu!(lazer) from osu!(stable) in Windows.** In certain context menus and settings (such as when changing the default app to open `.osz` files with), the lazer version is now denoted as "osu!(lazer)" instead of just "osu!".
- **The shuffle button has been added to the "now playing" overlay and is enabled by default.** This is great news for everyone who loves leaving the game in the background with music playing. (Did you know you can select a specific collection to play?)
