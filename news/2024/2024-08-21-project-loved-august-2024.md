Bask in the soothing sun and enjoy a catalogue of fancy Loved picks here!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

If perchance you're unfamiliar with what we do, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to determine which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the beatmaps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) of their respective game modes. You can click on the banners below for each pick to vote on the poll for that map, and there is a description underneath each banner written by a Loved captain. There is also a [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) as well if you want to view the polls directly. The voting stage lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote!

More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

Ahoy!! We are the Loved pirates ‚òÜ

Avast ye, landlubbers! It's time to release yer inner pirates and join captain [Antares-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2194763), and quartermasters [PaRaDogi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2054596) and [Respirte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9870167) on the waves for this month's *Popular Playcount*, [Ahoy!! Warera Houshou Kaizoku Dan\*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1228443#osu/2557387)!!

This one has been racking up a hefty following in the Graveyard with over 530,000 plays and probably a map you've encountered in a multiplayer lobby somewhere, so we think this is a great fit for the category and for Loved. With a complete spread of difficulties, there's something for every skill level to enjoy.

Convinced? Go cast yer vote and let's set sail!! Yousoro\~!! ‚òÜ

No time to waste thinking back and forth for this one ‚Äî it's [t+pazolite - UMMU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/832146#osu) for this month's second *Popular Playcounts* pick!

Wow... how kind of [Bazuso](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11726139) to take us to the beach for a fun and relaxing time... "U make me upper," he muttered under his breath. Before I even had a chance to make sense of what that meant, an ominous countdown grabbed the attention of everyone nearby. Immediately, I was thrust into a whirlwind of back-and-forth patterns, each one more intense than the last. I was struggling to keep pace with the relentless barrage. But as the map progressed, I started to see the method in the madness, the artistry in every carefully placed slider and burst. It's like Bazuso was guiding me, daring me to push past my limits.

I gave myself a moment to breathe before the map's final section, feeling Bazuso's presence beside me. With a final surge of determination, I conquered the spaced geometric streams, the last note hitting with a satisfying thud. Exhausted but elated, I realized this was no ordinary map ‚Äî it was a test of endurance, skill, and sheer willpower. And I passed.

Now, it's time to cast your vote and ensure this masterpiece takes its rightful place in the Loved section. After all, the experience I just had is one that every player should face.

For this month's *Outstanding Oldies*, we've got [Falcom Sound Team jdk - RELEASE OF THE FAR WEST OCEAN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/77504#osu) by [CSY the corrupt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/304513).

This map was uploaded back in February of 2013, back when mappers were known as "cartographers" and top players were aiming with quill and parchment ‚Äî from the geometric patterning and difficulty settings, you can tell right away. Despite its short 1:36 runtime, it's absolutely loaded with charm and still holds up as a unique and near-addicting experience over a decade later. Special shoutout to this absolute tune from Falcom Sound Team as well. What's not to love?? d\[-_-\]b

If this ancient cartography appeals to you, make sure to cast yes for your vote!

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick is [lapix - Discloze (Extended)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/648652#osu/1374107) by [sionKotori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1083407)!

I'm sure you've all heard of lapix, the rhythm game giant known for his groovy and catchy hi-tech songs and this one is no different ‚Äî this map is 5 minutes of masterfully crafted alt-tech mapping and sits at 5.98‚òÖ. If you're a big fan (like me!) of the 2017 tech style defined by heavily structured but gameplay-focused patterns and sharp aesthetics, then I suggest you check *Discloze* out and head to the thread to cast your vote!

This month's Daredevil Difficulties is... wait.... this can't be....

Yes, [gazimal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6055351) has made his long-awaited debut into Loved with none other than [Shining Stella](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1762036#osu/3606457). This demonic conglomeration of pure aim control impels only the best to straight up lock in for 4 minutes of cutstreams, wiggletech, I promise I'm not making up words, and overall cursor control. Of course, gazimal delivers with an extremely fun skillcap map, and I promise that this is just the beginning for what's to come. üëçüëç

Remember to vote yes, and see you guys on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Foworum)!

RANKED REJECTS.... your favourite category's favourite category! It's time for another ultracollab.

[Nattu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1886722) is back for Loved with a huge megaset of bulow's [Revolver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1670825#osu/3981167). Featuring a ton of difficulties from multiple mappers across the globe lies the cherry on top in the Collab diff, where your favourite mappers like [Mazzerin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2942381), [fanzhen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699), [handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2123087) and [tatemae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5223028) finally get together on a fire track. Most difficulties all have completely different mapping styles, so whether you want to play some crazy flow on Nattu's difficulty, simple aim and burst from [Azrealy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12235272), or the multiple tech styles throughout the collab, there's definitely something for everyone here.

üéµ Everybody watch her, don't try to stop her, anyone have the time?

Absolutely. *StrangeProgram*? ~~Ok that song is actually kinda bad.~~ Anyways, you get the point.

Please vote "YES!" on this map! One step at a time.... the speed agenda will finally be in full pursuit throughout the Loved section...

The Second Wildcard for this month is [Nameless Player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4133758)'s map of [Himeringo - Cruel Clocks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1002449#osu).

This song is such a classic, amazing cover by Himeringo. Nameless Player does a really good job representing the intensity of this song with jumps. Unlike most other "aim maps", this map has a lot of structure and thought put into it, which all ties in really well. With 4 minutes of 8.07‚òÖ unfiltered aim consistency, this map is quite the challenge. This could very well be considered for Ranked if it was actually pushed by the mapper, but it seems to be of low interest to them. That's why it can have its place here in Loved.

Last but not least, The Third Wildcard for this month is [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902)'s mapset of [siinamota feat. Kagamine Rin - Shoujo A](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2053038#osu).

Featuring [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078), [Plasma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077431), [Raijodo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13400075), [Share](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14305018), and [Tedda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6906789), this is an absolute stacked set by well-known players/mappers. A very trendy song of the past year, mrekk's goal with this set is very clear. A popular map by the #1 player on osu!.

This set ranges from 9.56‚òÖ to 7.2‚òÖ, showing that this is a set for the very best just like the mapper himself. All difficulties except the Raijodo x FlyingTuna collab are very straightforward aim maps to attract the very best of that skillset. The Raijodo x FlyingTuna difficulty might still be aim but nowhere near the rest. At a very quick glance, you can see that it's AR 8.5, littered with many geometrical/alternate-y patterns at 260 BPM. It's absolute hell if you don't specialize in low AR aim.

Amassing nearly 100,000 playcount and 380+ favorites, there's no doubt that this map deserves a chance here. Want to see the #1 player get his first Loved map? It's up to you, vote now!

This month we present a map featuring a song remixed by a Featured Artist and mapped by another Featured Artist!

[TUYU - Anoyo-iki no Bus ni Notte Saraba. (a? edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1280928#taiko/2660687) was remixed by [A? (Aquestion)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/173) and mapped by [7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/356). The BPM is 280 and the overall speed is fast, and there are few breaks, making this a challenging map for beginners. Also, the volume and the placement of the notes at the end is very crazy, and one cannot relax until the very end to achieve an S-rank!

The original song has been Ranked/Loved a lot in osu!taiko, but it is very rare to find such a high-level map with this song, and it is a very fun map to beat!

Have fun! Enjoy!! <3

Do you like a challenging, difficult map?

If so, we'd like to introduce [katagiri - Heisei Memehunters (Lzie Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1092453#taiko/2283616) mapped by [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349)!

This map clocks in at 320 BPM with a high density of 1/4 and 1/6 patterns! If you want to strengthen your fingers, this is a very good choice, and possibly the best map for you! If you are not confident in your skills, don't worry! There is a nerfed difficulty with only 1/4 patterns! We hope you take on both of them and join us in developing your skills!

*description written by [Boaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13302996)*

A dream come true for some, a nightmare for most. [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)'s infamous map, [VERTeX](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/856990#taiko/1790210), finally enters the Loved voting!

If you've never heard of this map, let me fill you in on it: *VERTeX* seems like an innocent map at first glance, but soon enough you'll be met with many 1/2 finishers. With both the older mapping style and the challenging finishers, this map can serve as the perfect finisher training map. This map is also perfect for testing your finisher skills compared to others since the ending gets quite hard.

Are you ready to take these finishers head on? Make sure to cast your vote in the Project Loved August edition!

Coming in for August's Project Loved, we have the return of INO with his old-school [ETIA. - Firestorm.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/364795#fruits/800693)

This classic INO map, mapped in 2015, demonstrates snaps, precision, and platter control more than anything, including a high CS rate of 5 and a low AR of 9.5. Playing through this reminded me partially of [CLSW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253)'s [Seven Deadly Sins Series Maps Compilation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/524546#fruits/1113361), specifically *Pet Peeve*.

Perhaps one of the most recognizable maps of 2023 is being played on the grandest stage of USA vs SK. The mapper [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187), exceptionally well versed in this skill set, allowed for an expertly designed Hard Rock test that won the hearts of those who had the pleasure of practicing the map. Pairing this with such a unique song generates an experience that can't be recreated by anyone besides the king himself.

Yep. You can't have a Project Loved without a zoomer hyperwalk map waltzing its way in sometimes. But do any of you remember this one by chance? Well, this is more of a fun hyperwalk practice map than a challenging one, and hyperwalks are more suitable on a song like Camellia's [Hello (BPM) 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1443872#fruits), set at a whopping 2021 BPM. Here is another by [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284), who created hyperwalk maps like [LUZE \* Emew - Unmeiron](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/578344#fruits/1224549). I hope you enjoy it.

[give (Nightcore Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2041097#mania/4258224) certainly has a lot of tricks up its sleeves, with many SV patterns made to throw you off. As a [Vietnamese National Mania Championship 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1779599) Grand Ginals custom SV entry, [Micleak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16140674) and [Lott](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13821222) had a lot of room for creativity and experimentation, both of which were applied in mass quantity on this map.

This is going to be the first Loved feature of the infamous "initial reverse scroll" gimmick. It has been an obscure but somewhat known fact that mappers could, through the use of what is essentially magic, start off a map with a reverse scroll. Unfortunately, this can only be reversed once, so only initial gimmicks are possible. I think this is definitely the most convincing and polished execution of this gimmick to date.

In the main drop, so-called "1-millisecond offset" gimmicks are applied for a really flashy visual experience. The idea is to offset simultaneous notes by 1 millisecond and apply high SV and BPM values to that single millisecond gap so that it looks like there's a gap, but there's not. One of those features is actually even a reference to Nivrad00's Aspire V entry [Chilli Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1236952#mania/2571106).

These trends have been exploited more and more in actual tournament SVs lately, so this Loved nomination is kind of a precursor to more of those gimmicks in the future. We hope having more and more diverse execution of SVs despite technical limitations inspires other mappers, and... eventually unlocks more technical abilities in the future? Pretty please? ü•∫üëâüëà

A lot of [11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526)'s charts cater more to the upper echelon of the playerbase; however, in this round of Loved, we are giving you something that could probably cover more players, regardless of what skill level you are at. Presenting... [1,000,000 TIMES](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1222586)!

This beatmap focuses more on both the jumpstream and stamina skillsets. Luckily for you, the patterning isn't exactly the most difficult and technical, as sometimes jumpstreams could end up being broken, but this beatmap leans more towards straightforward territory. Then again though, trilling certainly is still a huge factor in this map, as you have to ensure that the control you have for this map is good enough that you do not end up rushing or falling behind on those patterns, while also balancing your stamina, as this is essentially 5 minutes of jumpstreams with only a few breaks in between.

Being OD 8, thankfully, this isn't a beatmap that's extremely strict in accuracy, but it's still something to consider, especially with how control, stamina, and reading come into play. If 200 BPM is not enough for you, then we have rates from 1.1x to 1.4x, which would be around 220 up to as fast as 280 BPM! With this big BPM range, we hope that every player in different skill ratings will have fun and enjoy the chart as much as possible.

Do you have what it takes to match the best of the best players at a faster rate? Would you want a test of accuracy and control? Or do you just want to see more of these straightforward jumpstream picks in Loved? If your answer is yes to any of these, don't hesitate to show your support to [11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526) and give this map a favorable vote!

It's about time [Jhown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14772488) gets some recognition in Project Loved, as they are very well known for their chordjack maps, and [ISCHEZAYU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2002455) is certainly no exception!

[ISCHEZAYU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2002455) starts off already with some pretty dense chordjack patterning, where it goes: jump/hand -> quad -> jump/hand, for the most part. However, in a few occasions, it will suddenly go with repetitive quads, which could drain your stamina extremely fast. Luckily though, there are a few breaks which would ideally give you breathing room for a little bit; however, once those breaks are over, it's back to very stamina-draining chordjacks. This map in turn gives you so many challenges in terms of reading, control, and stamina.

There are certainly opportunities for you to train these kinds of maps, as the base rate of this difficulty may not seem too much physically, and for the most part, would only really give you troubles on the reading aspect; however, if that is not enough to satisfy you, the mapset features rate-up difficulties up to 1.8x! Should you want to keep on grinding and push the limits of your chordjack control, physicality, and reading, then this map is certainly for you.

Don't forget to leave your comments on the post, and most importantly, don't forget to give [Jhown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14772488) your support, and give this map YOUR yes vote!

[Guilhermeziat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661387) has made many, many, MANY difficult charts in the past. For once, we're giving you something... quite normal? I say normal, but it's still very much a chart you can tell is from him.

[Water Elemental](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1917756#mania) was used as the tech qualifier for [Speed of Light 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1686361?n=1), and ended up being far and above the most popular qualifier out of the 6 (even when including the fact that two of them are no longer uploaded), so it's easy to say that people undoubtedly like it, which is great to see due to how controversial Guilhermeziat's charts can be at times.

The chart takes a unique approach to a genre that's gained heavy traction in recent years, which would be "Color Bass". You've got many wubs and other dump-able sounds that allow for tons of room for expression, and the patterns absolutely nail the ideas behind the song into a playable chart. With the entire thing being dumped, the variety in snap usage gives a different feel for each sound, which really helps distinguish what you're playing, rather than having everything feel the same. Not to mention, even though I called this normal, it's still far from it. I hope you enjoy the trill at 01:41:584.

To put it simply, this chart is good. Tech players like this. Rice players like this. You will like this. Go vote for this.

Someone call [nayeonie bunny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15187174), because they're seeing their first chance at Loved with their chart of [ABC (feat. Sophia Black)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2004631#mania)!

Perhaps you've played some charts by nayeonie bunny before, and if you have, you'd know very well that they've got a great ability to make dump charts that have an addition of unique long notes in spots where it just... feels right? It's rather hard to explain, but the flow the long notes have make it feel much more interactive. Even if you're not a fan of that, you can play the low LN diff for, well, less long notes. Don't take the difficulty name literally though, as there's still a good amount of LNs, showing how this chart tries to stay true to its original identity.

Speaking of original identities, you've also got two minor SV changes you need to look out for. Sounds bad, but you'd be surprised how many people enjoy it, as demonstrated by [4DM 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2024) using it as a pick. This came as a big surprise since this is far from what anyone would call a tournament chart, yet people enjoyed this one being in the Quarterfinals pool!

This chart truly conforms to nothing, and the rewards of doing that clearly show. If you've been wanting more spice in the Loved section, give this your vote!

The \[delete\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\

*description written by [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622)*

There is something about FELT's music that has caused many LN maps to be made based on their songs. Maybe it's the close relation osu! has with *Touhou* or maybe it's the way the background instrumentals mix so well with their vocalist. Whatever the case, there are more than enough different maps to fill up multiple packs full of just FELT LN. However, I think [-\[Ulazis\]-'s](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1532787#mania/3497645) LN collection is the one that has garnered the most attention since it was made.

The pack has a wide range of difficulties starting from *Reason*, a calm song which features simple releases where players can practice their fundamentals while relaxing to piano and amazing vocals. On the complete opposite side, *Lost in the Abyss* is a 5-minute gauntlet of 180 BPM LN steams which, even with breaks, can be difficult to overcome with high acc even if we include the lower OD of the map.

If you are like me and started out your LN journey listening to FELT or if you are just starting to enjoy LNs and need a break from all the maps that you've been playing, be sure to vote "yes" in the poll!

The fast 200 BPM bootleg drums, comfortable low-density chordstreams, a variety of patterns including suitable hybrids, and visual note design will definitely put you in a "happy" mood, as the map description puts it.

But beware of the occasional mini jacks and graces, even though these elements are a good example of his mapping style that adds to the fun. Challenging the FC could be a great way to enjoy this map.

For this month's pick, we present you with a map from veteran player [Lostcool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766374), who created a lot of masterpieces throughout his playing and charting journey! For this opportunity, we decided to choose [Digital Life Hacker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1710778#mania/4009429) by wotoha!

This chart was originally featured in the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_7K) Grand Finals as the LN consistency pick, and true to its name, the chart features a lot of *O2Jam* patterns that have a lot of LN dumpstreams that are mainly delay-focused. These patterns require an immense amount of handspeed combined with coordination skills and a lot of shields, which get harder and denser towards the end. These are all the elements that got executed properly and make it a challenging yet really fun map to play for high-level players!

We have been waiting for a while to make this map Loved, and we hope that you will show your support by casting a positive vote for the map if you enjoy this pick!

The beatmap as a whole is very solid for players to train their skills. The beatmap as a whole is a significant challenge to the player's stamina, and it also requires an ability to cope with the bracket-y patterns at high BPM and lower density.

Marirose was a pioneer of mania 5K scenes a long time ago and offered a lot of low-level maps. This map has a simple structure of hip-hop beats and dubstep, but it's fun enough to play and the representation of patterns in repeated beats also seems interesting.

We think it's a good map for players entering 5K, and for skilled players, we can also recommend using Double Time. We are sure that this map is well qualified to be the first 5K single-spread Loved map set.
