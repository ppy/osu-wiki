The Monthly Beatmapping Contest (*MBC*) has been running strong since the start of 2020. Review the essentials on the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest).

## Community Vote

We didn't expect too many submissions to April's contest since its limitation was the most difficult yet, but osu! mappers don't disappoint!

There were over **60 submissions** which our team of experienced beatmappers narrowed down to the **top 6 finalists.** Your job now is to vote for your **2 favourite maps**! When voting, keep in mind the contest's mapping limitation: *all sliders needed to have reverse arrows*.

Anyway, onto May's contest!

## Schedule

As per usual, the timeline for this month's contest is as follows:

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks, ends May 26th):** Contest is announced and beatmappers create their entries.
- **Screening (1 week):** Entries are evaluated by experienced beatmappers.
- **Voting (2 weeks):** Top entries from screening are published for the osu! community to vote on.
- **Rewards:** Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including osu!supporter, profile badges, and the *Elite Mapper* user title!

## Beatmapping

### Song

While the MBC usually provides a choice between 5 songs, this month's [limitation](#limitation) requires only one song:

#### [Creo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/36) - Gravitate (172 BPM)

[Special beatmap template download](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/95/Creo_-_Gravitate.osz) (3:06)

</audio>

### Limitation

Mapping restrictions are the bread and butter of the MBC. Every contest features a new limitation for mappers to work around, such as *star rating cannot exceed 4.00 stars* or *all sliders must be straight lines*.

This month's limitation: **rhythm in the [beatmap template](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/95/Creo_-_Gravitate.osz) cannot be changed**.

Unlike the usual blank-map templates, this one includes rhythm for the full map! Object positions on the playfield are temporary however, so your objective is to arrange circles and sliders in the most engaging ways possible.

You can freely change difficulty settings, new combos, slider velocities, and anything else your heart desires — *but only if the template's rhythm stays the same!*

## Rules

So how do you participate? Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation): *rhythm in the [beatmap template](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/95/Creo_-_Gravitate.osz) cannot be changed***.
- **be in `.osz` format.** This allows your entry to use custom hitsound files and a background of your choice, however storyboarded visuals will be removed from all submissions.
- **be a single difficulty for the month's [selected song](#song).**
- **be in the osu! game mode.** Other game modes will be considered after trialing this contest with osu! only.
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/voting phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be discarded.

Any entries breaking these rules will not be viable for the contest.
