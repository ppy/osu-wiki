With 10 months of consecutive contests, the [**Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***)](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) has had a solid run since its relaunch in 2020. We'll be taking a break for now while mappers focus on [A Labour of Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-11-30-a-labour-of-love), a special remixing + mapping + storyboarding contest! If you're still itching to compete, you know what to do.

There's more to say about the MBC going forward, but the results for October's contest shouldn't be left hanging!

## Leaderboard

This month's **41** slider-only entries were whittled down to the top **7** finalists by a team of experienced mappers (we call them [screeners](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening)). Another group of experienced mappers judged those finalists to choose the winners!

### Winner

Rising from seemingly nowhere as a first-time MBC participant, [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840) blasted all expectations with his **winning** map for [kiraku - flora](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1322809).

Fully embracing the variable slider velocity and obscure slider-shape style that defines *technical mapping*, he impressed judges with peak performance in almost all categories. It's an effective choice for a slider-only contest, making this map worthy of its title.

With this performance, 0ppInOsu earned himself the first tier MBC profile badge, but he's got a long way to go before reaching *Elite Mapper* status!

### Runner-up

[Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) is in practically the opposite situation.

Having participated in *every* MBC of 2020 aside from the first, he's a contest veteran with certified mapping prowess, as seen by his **runner-up** submission for [kiraku - Dragon Blood](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1317855). By now you probably know what Mao's maps are like, so if you're a fan of overlaps and unconventional patterns, you'll have a good time.

With one win under his belt, one runner-up score, and one screening crew #1, he's adding another trophy to the pile this month. The [MBC leaderboards](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#points) show that he's juuuust a smidge away from the top, but we'll have to wait until next year to see if it happens.

### Screening crew favourite

And let's not forget the [screening crew](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening)!

For the last few contests their picks have aligned with the contest winner, but that can't be said about this round's praise for [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923) on [kiraku - connection](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1317565). With 3 screeners picking this as their favourite submission and 3 others putting it in their top 3, Halgoh undoubtedly had a solid performance!

While the Monthly Beatmapping Contest will be on hold for a bit, that doesn't mean it's gone forever! Once [A Labour of Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-11-30-a-labour-of-love) is finished it'll be back with some appreciation for mappers of other modes too!

Thanks to everyone for making the Monthly Beatmapping Contest a success over the last year!
