What is this *Mappers' Guild* thing? In short, it's a way for mappers to earn rewards for mapping songs from osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists). If you're out of the loop, check out the [Mappers' Guild wiki page](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) and [its website](https://mappersguild.com)!

A lot has changed since [our last update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-03-23-featured-artist-beatmap-updates-from-the-mappers-guild) and now! Two artists are being announced per week and mappers have been grinding out maps like their lives depend on it.

In the last 8 months **85** quests have been completed, nearly **400**  (yes, *400!*) Featured Artist beatmaps have been ranked, and **22** new medals are now available to earn!

## Mappers' Guild system developments

There's been countless changes to the Mappers' Guild system, but here's some of the most important changes since our last update:

- **Showcase mapsets** - Ever notice how there's one or two maps ranked for a Featured Artist *just before* their announcement? Tier 1+ guild members of all modes are asked to create these! If you want to learn about Featured Artists early and have your own maps showcased, earn some points and your wish will come true!
- **Monthly Beatmapping Contest quests** - If you've ever been a finalist in one of these contests, there's new quests made just for you! Rank your highly praised map for some extra Mappers' Guild points!
- **Create your own quests** - Tier 1+ members of the guild can submit their own quests from the quest page! Quests only cost 25-100 points to create depending on their criteria, so send in your ideas!

## Major contributors

While we would usually list each recently ranked Featured Artist song, a list of **400** beatmaps would be a bit insane.

Instead we'll be highlighting some of the big time contributors to the Mappers' Guild!

Each of these users have hosted 3+ ranked mapsets or created 10+ ranked difficulties since our previous update in March. Numbers below are for the period between our last update and today.
