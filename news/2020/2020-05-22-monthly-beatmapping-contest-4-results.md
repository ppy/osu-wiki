Curious as to how one makes a map with only reverse sliders? See how the winners of the fourth monthly beatmapping contest managed!

The **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) has been pumping out constant mapping competition for all of 2020. The details may be overwhelming for those jumping in late, so review the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) if you're confused.

## Winners

### Community vote winner

Votes for all finalists can be found on the [contest's listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/93). The limitation for this month's submissions was *all sliders must have reverses.*

Coming in with **58** votes, [LeaF - Mopemope](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1174616) by [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) took lead in the community vote poll, making it **this month's winner!**

hypercyte must be doing something right, given he was the community vote runner-up and screening crew favorite last month. Having earned [**4** MBC points](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards), he's reached the second tier profile badge for MBC rewards (seen below!). If he manages to earn 2 more points, he'll be the first Elite Mapper crowned through the Monthly Beatmapping Contest!

### Community vote runner-up

Close behind with **50** votes, [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699) nearly won the community vote with his first ever submission to the MBC: [LeaF - POISON AND÷OR AFFECTION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1175232), making him this month's **community vote runner-up!**

Players and mappers alike can appreciate this map for its barrage of unconventional yet engaging patterns. Pairing a stunning visual design with fancy cursor movement, it's safe to say that anyone reading should give this beatmap a play!

As the contest's runner-up, fanzhen0019 has earned one month of supporter and is halfway to the first reward tier's profile badge prize.

### Screening crew favorite

It may have been behind in the community vote, but [Acyl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309)'s execution of [LeaF - Chronostasis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1174743#osu/2450265) performed well in its own way!

The finalists of each MBC are decided by a team of experienced beatmappers, and 12 of 16 mappers this month put Acyl's map in their top 5, making it this month's **screening crew favorite!**

While most entries worked around the month's rhythm limitation by aligning slider reverses with no sounds in the music (as is seen often in the community vote winners), Acyl's entry avoided that with more musically representative reverse slider use. Circumventing cheap rhythm choice under this limitation while also managing to create a beautiful and cohesive map is a feat in itself, so it's no wonder that mappers loved this entry!

Like fanzhen0019, Acyl is halfway to the first reward threshold. See the [MBC rewards breakdown](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) for details on how this works.

We've got less than a week until submissions for [May's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/95) close, so head over there if you haven't already! The contest provides participants with a rhythm template, meaning the focus is on how you can manage interesting object arrangement. Good luck!

Until next month!
