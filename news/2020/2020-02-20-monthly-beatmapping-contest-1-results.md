In case you're out of the loop, the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) has been revived for a new run in 2020. Read the contest schedule and details on the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest). Got everything? Good. Onto the results!

## Winners

Votes for all finalists can be found on the [contest's listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/84).

**Community vote winner:** **[MYLK - Kiradoki Harmony](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1111940#osu/2323164)** by **[melon boy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3053382)** (previously known as Fuccho), masked as Prejudicial Robin.

Receiving a towering **78** votes, melon boy's submission soared to the top of the community vote poll and was crowned the #1 entry in this month's contest! This beatmap features tons of 145 BPM stream jumps with a large circle size, making for a difficult yet manageable alternating-focused experience!

For his reward, melon boy has earned a newly-polished profile badge (design below!) and two months of osu!supporter. See the **[rewards](#rewards)** section for more details.

**Community vote runner-up:** **[MYLK - Waffle Wave](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1112024#osu/2323356)** by **[Moecho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5075660)**, masked as Imprudent Bunting.

With an impressive **66** votes, Moecho's entry landed in second place for the contest's community vote! While the users in charge of deciding this contest's finalists were more than exhausted by hearing *Waffle Wave* hundreds of times, they noted that this beatmap's rhythms featuring reversing sliders stood out. If you're looking for a refreshing take on rhythm choice, give this map a shot!

As the contest's runner-up, Moecho earned a month of supporter and is halfway to the first reward tier's profile badge prize! Again, see the **[rewards](#rewards)** section for more details.

**Screening crew's favorite:** **[MYLK - Daydreamer](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/84/entries/osz/MYLK%20-%20Daydreamer%20(Warm%20Pronghorn).osz?2020)** by **[Altai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865)**, masked as Warm Pronghorn.

All MBC submissions are screened by about 10 experienced beatmappers to decide the finalists. This month, more than half of the screening crew placed Altai's submission in their top 5 out of over 100 entries! With a high contrast slider velocity gimmick, this beatmap is an experience like no other. It didn't quite pull in community votes, but may appeal more to the mapper audience!

Like the runner-up, Altai has earned a month of supporter and is halfway to the prize threshold for a profile badge.

In addition to these winners, every participant has received a message showing how the screening crew viewed their entry. We hope that in the coming months, some of them could be winners too!

## Rewards

As per feedback received on the initial [Monthly Beatmapping Contests Return news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-01-05-monthly-beatmapping-contests-return), we've adjusted prize thresholds to be more in line with other beatmapping contests!

MBC points are still distributed to winners: **2** for the community vote winner + **1** for the community vote's runner-up and screening crew's favorite. These are unchanged, however the threshold for rewards have been adjusted:

- **Profile badge:** badges are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one (and they get progressively shinier!).
- ***Elite Mapper* forum title:** attainable at 6 points.
- **osu!supporter:** each point earned provides a user with a month of supporter for themselves or someone of their choosing.

A points breakdown for all MBC participants can be found on the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#points).

That'll do it for January's contest! Keep in mind that February's MBC is still in the beatmapping phase, so head over to the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/89) and submit as soon as you can. There's less than a week left until submissions close!

See you in March!
