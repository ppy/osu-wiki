Not sure how the Monthly Beatmapping Contest (*MBC*) works? Be sure to read through the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) for info on the contest's structure, previous winners, and much more.

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks):** Contest is announced at the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- **Screening (1 week):** Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers.
- **Judging (2 weeks):** Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers.
- **Rewards:** Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including osu!supporter, profile badges, and the *Elite Mapper* user title!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Each MBC features a different way to keep entries fresh. For example, last month's contest forbid sliders 1/2 of a beat long.

This month's limitation: **circle size must be 0**.

Ranked maps can now use circle size (*CS*) 0, so we're curious to see how mappers handle it!

CS below 2 and above 7 can't be set in the song setup menu, so you'll need to change this in your map's `.osu` file on line 34 as seen below.

Make sure you're careful — changing anything in song setup will reset your CS to 2!

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between 5 songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is [**Klayton / Celldweller**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/56), and the following songs are viable for contest submissions:

## Rules

So how do you participate? Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation): *circle size must be 0***
- **be in `.osz` format.** This allows your entry to use custom hitsound files and a background of your choice, however storyboarded visuals will be removed from all submissions.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **be in the osu! game mode.**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/voting phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be discarded.

Any entries breaking these rules will not be viable for the contest.

## Community vote vs. Judging

Community vote is out the door.

Those keeping up with the MBC likely noticed that May's contest results haven't been published. This is because the community vote is unfortunately being removed due to lowering voter turnout, potential vote manipulation, and general concern for results.

Instead we'll be temporarily replacing the community vote with *judging*. The top ~5 entries of each contest will be thoroughly evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Musical representation:** How effectively the beatmap's rhythms, object placements, and hitsounds fit the music.
- **Creativity:** How inventive the beatmap's structure/design choices are.
- **Gameplay:** How engaging the beatmap is to play.
- **Limitation:** How effectively the beatmap fits the contest's limitation.

More details on judging can be found on the [MBC wiki article's judging section](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging).

While the results for May's contest will remain based on community vote results, the top entries in later MBCs will be judged by a panel of mappers separate from the screening crew — at least for now.

That said, look forward to May's and June's results!

## Submission

When you're ready, submit your entry on the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/108). You've got **3 weeks!**
