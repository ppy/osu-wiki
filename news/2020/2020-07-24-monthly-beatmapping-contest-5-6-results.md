Winners of the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) were previously decided by a community vote, but are now decided by a team of judges. Read the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) for details on what changes were made and why!

## June's Winners

The **37** total submissions were screened by a group of experineced mappers and narrowed down to the **top 7** finalists. A different group of mappers were tasked with closely evaluating the finalists and deciding the winners:

| Rank | Beatmap | Judging | Musical representation (70) | Creativity (70) | Gameplay (70) | Limitation (35) | Raw total | Standardized total |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| \#1 | [Parhelia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220897#osu/2539737) by [Kalibe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3376777) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=5ef783cb65cf866966d7a02a) | 47 | 47 | 51 | 27 | **172** | **1.43** |
| \#2 | [Darkest Heights](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220791#osu/2539484) by [xbopost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6842421) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=5ef783c265cf866966d7a028) | 48 | 46 | 51 | 27 | **172** | **1.42** |
| \#3 | [Darkest Heights](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220874#osu/2539701) by [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=5ef783aa65cf866966d7a023) | 52 | 39 | 55 | 28 | **174** | **1.41** |
| \#4 | [Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220772#osu/2539454) by [K4L1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11334594) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=5ef7839465cf866966d7a020) | 46 | 50 | 40 | 26 | **162** | **-0.04** |
| \#5 | [The Style of Evermore](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220860#osu/2539633) by [Altai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=5ef783a265cf866966d7a022) | 47 | 38 | 47 | 27 | **159** | **-0.33** |
| \#6 | [Invincible](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220881#osu/2539718) by [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=5ef7837465cf866966d7a01a) | 48 | 38 | 53 | 29 | **168** | **-0.68** |
| \#7 | [Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220983#osu/2539927) by [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=5ef7836a65cf866966d7a018) | 45 | 44 | 40 | 32 | **161** | **-3.22** |

Scores between the top 3 entries were unreasonably close, so instead of crowning only one winner, we'll crown all 3!

Kalibe, xbopost, and Sylas have each been awarded the first-place equivalent prize: the Monthly Beatmapping Contest profile badge and 2 months of supporter. Because this is Sylas's second time winning the MBC, his badge will be replaced with the second-tier profile badge design.

But that's not all for Sylas! Half of the screeners, aka the mappers who decide the finalists, placed his entry in their top 5, meaning Sylas is also the screening crew's favorite! Check the [MBC points list](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) to see how close Sylas is to earning the grand prize!

### Honorable mentions

While they didn't win, some other finalists also deserve shoutouts!

[K4L1's entry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220772#osu/2539454) featured super cool keysounds and an array of delicately designed patterns, so we recommend giving it a look if you value the technical craft of mapping!

[Mao's entry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220983#osu/2539927) also stood out by creatively toying with the contest's "no 1/2 sliders allowed" limitation. Pairing slider tick rate 2 with slidershapes like the one below recreates the feeling of 1/2 sliders â€” that's something no other entry came close to attempting! Be sure to give this map a play if you're itching for a fresh experience.

## May's Winners

In March, hypercyte's entry of [Sound Souler - Bubble Flower](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1152177#osu/2404822) was both the runner-up and the screening crew's favorite. In April, his entry of [LeaF - Mopemope](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1174616#osu/2450028) was the overall community vote winner. And in May, he took yet another step forward!

hypercyte's entry of [Creo - Gravitate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1196564#osu/2492702) reached the peak of the community vote with **44** votes and was acclaimed among the screening crew with top 5 placements from **8** of the 11 screeners.

With consistent praise from both the playing and mapping communites through the MBC, it's safe to say that hypercyte is a mapper well-deserving of his new *Elite Mapper* forum title! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Community vote runner-up

Hard work has also paid off for [Acylica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309) with his entry of [Creo - Gravitate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1196772#osu/2493041). After reaching the MBC finalists 4 times, winning the screening crew's favorite pick in April, and winning of the community vote runner-up this month, Acylica has earned the first tier MBC prize!

Despite his win in this category, we're sure that he (and many other mappers) are happy that the MBC will no longer be using the community vote system. Concerns with voting manipulation and lowering voter turnout led to this outcome, however sticking with standard judging would make the MBC a little too stale, so look out for new evaluation methods in the future!
