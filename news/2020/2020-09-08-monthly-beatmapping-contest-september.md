Have what it takes to stand above other mappers? Put your skills to the test in this month's overlap-themed contest!

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest (*MBC*) is built with a lot of nuts and bolts. If you're new to this, be sure to read the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) for details on how things work.

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks):** Contest is announced at the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- **Screening (1.5 week):** Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers.
- **Judging (1.5 weeks):** Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers.
- **Rewards:** Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including osu!supporter, profile badges, and the *Elite Mapper* user title!

## Beatmapping

### Theme

Each month's contest usually features a mapping restriction, such as "no slider velocity changes" or "star rating cannot exceed 4.00". While these strict rules make for interesting competition, this month's contest is shaking up the formula with a *theme* instead of a *limitation*.

This month's theme: **every object should overlap another object.**

"But what counts as an overlap?", you're thinking. The answer depends on too many different things, so instead of limiting it to one interpretation, we'll leave it up to you!

Overlap every object with another object in whatever way you believe best expresses the theme. Screeners will consider how well the your map fits the theme and the "theme" judging category will be more heavily weighted.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between 5 songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is the punk rock king [**PUP**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/79), and the following songs are viable for contest submissions:

## Rules

So how do you participate? Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping theme](#theme): *every object should overlap another object.***
- **be in `.osz` format.** This allows your entry to use custom hitsound files and a background of your choice, however storyboards/videos will be removed from all submissions.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **be in the osu! game mode.**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be discarded.

Any entries breaking these rules will not be viable for the contest.

## Submission

Contest submissions are open!

When you've triple-checked your map, head to the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/111) and submit your masterpiece. You've got 3 weeks until submissions close.

Good luck!
