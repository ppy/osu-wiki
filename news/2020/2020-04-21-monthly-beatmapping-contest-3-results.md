The **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) has been running strong since the start of the year! Take a peek at the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) for information on anything and everything MBC-related.

## Winners

Votes for all finalists can be found on the [contest's listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/91). The limitation for this month's submissions was *no slider velocity changes.*

Voting resulted in the closest competition we've seen yet! While there was a 20 vote difference between second and third places, there was only a **2** vote difference between first and second!

Receiving a hefty **85** votes, [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) (previously known as TheKoala) managed to top the community vote poll with his entry of [Sound Souler - Bubble Flower](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1152182#osu/2404833) and is **this month's winner!**

Given this contest's submissions could not change slider velocity, deciding the map's base slider velocity was a huge factor for map design. Sylas chose nearly the fastest slider speed out of all submissions, so the map's first half featured mainly circles to fit the song's low-intensity intro, while the second half distinctly contrasted with high speed/intensity sliders. Words can't express this as well as playing it yourself though — try it [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1152182#osu/2404833)!

Gathering **83** votes, [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377)'s submission of [Sound Souler - Bubble Flower](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1152177#osu/2404822) came in a close second, making him the **community vote's runner-up.**

That's not all he achieved in this contest though! MBC entries each month are screened by experienced mappers to determine which reach the voting stage. 10 of 13 screeners this month included hypercyte's entry in their top 5, making hypercyte the **screening crew's favorite!**

The screening crew almost universally noted how different slider shapes helped convey the song in place of slider velocity changes in this set, so check it out if that's your cup of tea!

## Rewards

As explained in the `Rewards` section of the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards), winning different categories earns a mapper points towards prizes: the community vote winner receives 2 points, while the runner-up and screening crew favorite each receive 1 point.

Because hypercyte won both of the single-point categories, he and Sylas both reached the reward threshold for the MBC profile badge seen below!

And while he didn't win, we'd like to give a shoutout to [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515)'s entry of [Sound Souler - Blackorient](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1152185#osu/2404842) for using the slowest base slider velocity allowed by the editor. It's legitimately impressive that he was able to make a decent map under that condition, so check it out!

That's it for March's MBC! We're looking forward to seeing what can be created for [April's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/93) under the extremely-restrictive *sliders must have reverses* limitation. Also check out the latest [Aspire V contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-04-09-aspire-v-a-new-format) if you're itching for even more mapping!

See you next month!
