The winners are crowned! See who managed to make the coolest circle-only beatmap from last month's mapping contest!

While a *community vote* previously decided winners of the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***), that task has now been taken over by a team of judges. Read the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) if you're confused about how any of this works!

## Leaderboard

**50** submissions. **9** finalists. Who came out on top?

As usual, all of this months' submissions were screened by a team of experienced mappers (a.k.a. the [screening crew](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening)). Another group of experienced mappers judged the screening crew's favorites and decided the contest's winners!

Some might raise eyebrows at how 3rd place's standardized score differs so much from 1st and 2nd while their raw scores are similar. The [mathy details](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) are confusing, but the short reason is because one judge's scores were *really* skewed towards that symmetry-based entry. Mappers familiar with this month's panel of judges can probably connect the dots ;).

### Winner

Runner-up [last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-08-27-monthly-beatmapping-contest-7-results) and now the winner this month, [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) holds first prize with his submission of [Silentroom - NULCTRL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1266008)!

Designing a map with **circle size 7** was a risky move by any mapper's standards, but it clearly paid off for this month's sliderless restriction. According to Mao, smaller circles allowed screen region usage to be more meaningful, as seen through a lot of its repitition/progression based patterns.

With this achievement, Mao finally earned himself the *second tier MBC profile badge* (seen below!) and two months of *osu!supporter*. If he manages to tuck another win under his belt, you might finally see a new *Elite Mapper* around!

### Runner-up

Contest veteran [Acylica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309) is yet to pull a win in the MBC, but he's getting damn close.

His entry of [Silentroom - Primatrix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1247457#osu/2631387) impressed the judges enough to earn him the **runner-up** spot, *and* his entry was the **most popular among screeners**, earning top 5 placement from 7 of the 10 screeners!

While Mao's entry utilized small circle size to better space objects apart, Acylica's entry takes a polar opposite approach. It's 2 minutes of almost non-stop streams, using the circle-only gimmick to express musical nuances with a variety of super-slick patterns. If that sounds like your kind of thing, be sure to give it a play.

In addition to his successes today, Acylica's submissions were also the screening crew's favorite in April's contest and the community vote runner-up in May's contest. Going by the [MBC rewards format](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards), this means Acylica has also earned himself two months of *osu!supporter* and the *second tier MBC profile badge*!
