Curious about how the Monthly Beatmapping Contest (*MBC*) works? See what you've missed on the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest), including instructions, previous winners, and all of the juicy rewards.

## Community Vote

With help from our team experienced beatmap screeners, we've selected the **top 5 finalists** from May's contest! Check them out and vote for your **favourite 2 maps**. Last month's contest required *all entries to use the same pre-defined rhythm*, so you should be focusing on how entries managed to create engaging beatmaps through object placements.

While we'd love it if you gave each entry a playthrough, you can also quickly eye your potential favorites in this video playlist:

## Schedule

As per usual, the timeline for this month's contest is as follows:

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks, ends June 26th):** Contest is announced and beatmappers create their entries.
- **Screening (1 week):** Entries are evaluated by experienced beatmappers.
- **Voting (2 weeks):** Top entries from screening are published for the osu! community to vote on.
- **Rewards:** Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including osu!supporter, profile badges, and the *Elite Mapper* user title!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

The MBC tries to keep mappers on their toes by featuring different mapping limitations each month. One previous contest required straight sliders only and another required star rating to be lower than 4.00 stars, to name a few.

This month's limitation: **sliders cannot be 1/2 of a beat long**.

![limitation example](/wiki/shared/news/2020-06-04-monthly-beatmapping-contest-june/mbc6.png)

For extra clarification, 1/2 sliders with reverse arrows are not allowed, while a 1/4 slider with a repeat is allowed. This limitation is focused on the length of the original slider!

We'd also like to provide three complimentary therapy sessions to mappers who can't imagine life without 1/2 sliders. We're sorry but it's time to let go.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between 5 songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is the drum 'n' bass legend [**Station Earth / Blue Marble**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/66), and the following songs are viable for contest submissions:

These songs were chosen specifically because they support tons of 1/2 sliders, so we wish you luck when composing rhythm!

## Rules

So how do you participate? Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation): *sliders cannot be 1/2 of a beat long***
- **be in `.osz` format.** This allows your entry to use custom hitsound files and a background of your choice, however storyboarded visuals will be removed from all submissions.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **be in the osu! game mode.**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/voting phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be discarded.

Any entries breaking these rules will not be viable for the contest.
