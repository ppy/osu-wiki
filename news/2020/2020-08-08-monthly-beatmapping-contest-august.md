Curious how your circle placing prowess holds up? With August comes yet another heated beatmapping competition!

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest (*MBC*) undergoes frequent changes, so check out the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) if you need to catch up.

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks):** Contest is announced at the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- **Screening (1 week):** Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers.
- **Judging (2 weeks):** Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers.
- **Rewards:** Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including osu!supporter, profile badges, and the *Elite Mapper* user title!

With this schedule in mind, note that July's contest is entering the judging phase! Its winners will be announced in about two weeks.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Because the MBC would be boring with the same premise monthly, each contest forces mappers to follow a different gimmick. Last month required Circle Size 0 and the month before disallowed sliders 1/2 of a beat long, just to name a few examples.

This month's limitation: **sliders cannot be used**.

Cut all ties with sliders — circles are your best friends this month! ...Plus a spinner or two, if you think you're clever.

Screeners for last month's limitation noted that entries didn't utilize the circle size limitation too well, which resulted in a lot of generic maps with oversized objects. This month's limitation was chosen because it disallows a lot of standard mapping techniques! (and it's requested practically every month!)

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between 5 songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is [**Silentroom**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/92), and the following songs are viable for contest submissions:

#### garland saga (195 BPM)

## Rules

So how do you participate? Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation): *sliders cannot be used.***
- **be in `.osz` format.** This allows your entry to use custom hitsound files and a background of your choice, however storyboarded visuals will be removed from all submissions.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **be in the osu! game mode.**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be discarded.

Any entries breaking these rules will not be viable for the contest.

## Submission

Submissions are open!

When you can see your reflection in your perfectly polished beatmap, head over to the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/110) to submit! The **3 week** countdown starts now.

Good luck!
