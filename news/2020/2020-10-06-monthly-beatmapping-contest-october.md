Are you a slider art connoisseur? Participate in this month's slider-only mapping contest to *really* find out!

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest (*MBC*) is... well, a mapping contest that runs every month. Its formatting can change though, so check out the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest).

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks):** Contest is announced at the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- **Screening (1.5 week):** Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers.
- **Judging (1.5 weeks):** Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers.
- **Rewards:** Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including osu!supporter, profile badges, and the *Elite Mapper* user title!

That said, you'll see results for last month's overlap-themed contest near the end of this month!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Each MBC features a different mapping restriction to take mappers out of their comfort zone. The contest a couple months ago disallowed sliders, so this month we'll look at the other end of the spectrum.

This month's limitation: **circles cannot be used.**

Anyone who's attempted slider-only mapping knows 1/4 rhythms can be difficult to express, so we chose some songs filled with 1/4 to make things extra fun. You're welcome.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between 5 songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is [**kiraku**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/101), and the following songs are viable for contest submissions:

#### mango sago (180 BPM)

## Rules

So how do you participate? Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation): *circles cannot be used.***
- **be in `.osz` format.** This allows your entry to use custom hitsound files and a background of your choice, however storyboarded visuals will be removed from all submissions.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **be in the osu! game mode.**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be discarded.

Any entries breaking these rules will not be viable for the contest.

## Submission

And of course, the contest is accepting entries for **3 weeks!**

Judges are itching to see your sliders shine, so head to the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/113) and submit once your masterpiece is ready.
