February's Monthly Beatmapping Contest has come to a close. Find out who wears the crown!

For those unfamiliar, the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) began its comeback in 2020. Everything you'd want to know about the contest is detailed on the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest), so give it a read.

## Winners

Votes for all finalists can be found on the [contest's listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/89). The main requirement for submissions was that *each could not exceed 4.00 stars.*

Topping with **43** votes, [Aphestra](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11949191)'s submission of [Voicians - Wolves](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/89/entries/Voicians%20-%20Wolves%20(Conspicuous%20Kite).osz?2020) made its way to the peak of the community vote poll and was deemed the **winner of this month's contest!**

This entry played it relatively safe — it features cleanly organized patterns, intricate slider shapes, and silky smooth gameplay. While you may not earn any performance points from it, it's still a comfortable ride that voters thoroughly enjoyed!

As a reward, Aphestra has earned Monthly Beatmapping Contest's first tier profile badge and two months of osu!supporter.

Garnering **37** votes, [UndeadCapulet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2523533)'s entry for [Voicians - Wolves](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/89/entries/Voicians%20-%20Wolves%20(Reckless%20Beaver).osz?2020) barely surpassed the third place entry by 1 vote to rise as the **community vote's runner-up!**

One of the screening crew members, [Uberzolik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1314547), noted that while most entries focused on creating low star rating yet engaging maps through slider velocity changes, this one took a different approach. Instead, this entry utilized its small circle size to draw out less conventional cursor movements while also employing unusual rhythms to create a stand-out experience. Give it a play if that's what you're into!

As the contest's runner-up, UndeadCapulet earned a month of supporter and is halfway to the first reward tier's profile badge prize! See the rewards breakdown on the [MBC wiki article's rewards section](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) for more info about how this works.

Submissions to this month's MBC were screened by 14 experienced beatmappers to decide the finalists. This month, [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515)'s entry for (yet again) [Voicians - Wolves](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1129015#osu/2358657) placed in the top 5 for 9 of those mappers, far surpassing any other entry in terms of screening votes and earnings its spot as the **screening crew's favorite!**

While it may be difficult to play because slider velocity bounces all over the spectrum, this entry definitely follows the music in a way that no other entries could stand up against!

Like the runner-up, Mao has earned a month of supporter and is halfway to the prize threshold for a profile badge.

## March's MBC

To see a bit more engagement with next month's community vote, we're going to make things easier for you by limiting the finalists to the **top 5** and showcasing video previews for each of them. Let's see how things pan out!

With all that said, we can finally conclude February's MBC. Remember that March's contest is about to end, so if you think you can quickly create a map without any slider velocity changes, give its [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/91) a peek.

Until next month!
