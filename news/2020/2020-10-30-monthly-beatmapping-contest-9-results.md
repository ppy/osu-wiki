Don't think it's possible to make a map where each object overlaps another? osu!'s newest Elite Mapper wants to have a word with you.

To avoid what was essentially a 5-way tie for 2nd place, "theme" scores from all judges are doubled and final scoring is based on raw totals. The category was initially scored out of 10. Modifying this category was deemed most appropriate because it is the focus of the contest.

### Winner

[xbopost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6842421) has completely dominated the MBC.

He earned first place in [June's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-07-24-monthly-beatmapping-contest-5-6-results). He earned first place in [July's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-08-27-monthly-beatmapping-contest-7-results). And while he didn't submit to August's, he earned first place in September's contest by a landslide!

His submission of [PUP - See You At Your Funeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1289138#osu/2676185) shows just how xbopost sets himself apart from the crowd.

While most submissions could be described as "*normal maps with lots of overlaps*", xbopost's **3.76 star Expert difficulty** took a truly unique approach. He legitimately tried to overlap each object with the previous object, throwing away the standard patterns that all other entries utilized, yet still being **universally recognized as the most impressive map by both MBC's screeners and judges.** It's a gameplay and map design experience that you'll regret missing out on, so give it a play!

Given his MBC track record and his incredible performance this month, xbopost is justified in his new profile badge and the *Elite Mapper* forum title!

Check out the [MBC leaderboards](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#points) if you're curious about who else might reach these heights soon!

### Runner-up

For those familiar with [UndeadCapulet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2523533)'s mapping, their performance as this month's **runner-up** should be no surprise.

All of their maps heavily involve overlaps and their submission of [PUP - Kids](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1289102#osu/2676108) continues the trend! If you're looking for a more difficult overlap-focused map than the winner, you're in the right place!

Having another runner-up position under their belt from [February's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-03-21-monthly-beatmapping-contest-2-results), UndeadCapulet has reached the threshold for the first tier MBC profile badge!

Looking for more mapping contests to participate in? We've got good news and bad news. Aside from finalizing the results for October's contest, the Monthly Beatmapping Contest will be taking a short break until the start of 2021.

Mapping contests aren't going away though! Launching next month is an entirely different kind of mapping contest. No spoilers here, but we think you'll *love* it.

...Anyway, see you then!
