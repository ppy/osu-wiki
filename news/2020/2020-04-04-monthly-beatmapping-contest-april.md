Since the start of the year, the Monthly Beatmapping Contest (*MBC*) has been pumping out new competition for experts of the editor. Read through the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) if you're out of the loop.

## Community Vote

Community voting for last month's contest is open as of today! Our team of experienced beatmappers chipped **60 submissions** down to the **top 5 finalists**, and we'd love you to vote for up to **2 of your favourites**!

Special thanks to [Regou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/419954) for providing replays for the videos. With that out of the way, let's dive into April's contest!

## Schedule

As per usual, the timeline for this month's contest is as follows:

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks, ends April 25th):** Contest is announced and beatmappers create their entries.
- **Screening (1 week):** Entries are evaluated by experienced beatmappers.
- **Voting (2 weeks):** Top entries from screening are published for the osu! community to vote on.
- **Rewards:** Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including osu!supporter, profile badges, and the *Elite Mapper* user title!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Given the frequency of the MBC, we like to keep things fresh by forcing mappers to design their maps under different limitations. For example, last month's entries were not allowed to change slider velocity and the previous month's entries couldn't exceed 4.00 stars.

This month's limitation: **sliders must have reverses**.

Throw everything you know about rhythm choice out the window — you're not allowed to use sliders *unless* they have a reverse arrow. This is likely the most difficult limitation the MBC has had so far, and we hope to see some unusual entries because of it!

For clarification, circles are still permitted in this contest, though a circle-only map is likely not going to pass the screening stage. Aim to use slider reverses (or repeats, whatever you want to call them) to their maximum potential.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between 5 songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is [**LeaF**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/73), and the following songs are viable for contest submissions:

#### Mopemope (200 BPM)

## Rules

So how do you participate? Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation): *sliders must have reverses.***
- **be in `.osz` format.** This allows your entry to use custom hitsound files and a background of your choice, however storyboarded visuals will be removed from all submissions.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **be in the osu! game mode.** Other game modes will be considered after trialing this contest with osu! only.
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/voting phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be discarded.

Any entries breaking these rules will not be viable for the contest.
