### Winner

For the second month in a row, [xbopost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6842421) dominates the competition with his submission of [Celldweller - One Good Reason](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1244127#osu/2586241)! Judges were impressed by his display all around, earning him the highest scores in each judging category.

But that's not all! The mappers who chose this month's finalists — a.k.a. the [screening crew](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) — loved this entry as well! 9 of the 10 mappers put this entry in their top 5, so it's safe to say this entry is deserving of its win!

With two wins and the screening crew's accolades, xbopost has earned the second tier MBC profile badge and is only an inch away from the third tier badge and the *Elite Mapper* user title! For extra reference, the [MBC points list](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) shows just how close he is!

### Runner-up

While he didn't win, nobody can say [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) doesn't have persistence! His maps have been finalists in each contest since February (that's 6 contests in a row!), and now he's earned a the runner-up position with [Celldweller - Eon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1244558#osu/2587071). His entries are always a blast to play, so give it a try if you're looking for something special!

Having won the screening crew's favorite in February, Mao has now reached the threshold for the first tier MBC profile badge. With his patience finally paying off, let's look forward to Mao's first place win soon!

That's it for July's contest! We're investigating more ways to reward mappers with the *Elite Mapper* title outside of contests like this, so look forward to some changes!
