There's so much to go over, so we'll dip right into it—just remember that **clicking the artist banners will take you directly to their Featured Artist listing**, and that the newer tracks listed in this post are likely to be towards the bottom of their respective page.

---

This should go without saying, but all the tracks listed above and every one on a Featured Artist listing are 100% free for use in mapping, so go ahead and get creative with things!

Now, even though we've just given you nearly two hundred new tracks to digest (like, *what*), we can't get off the train just yet! Those who follow these announcements will understand that this means a hint is afoot:

Pull up a chair and listen. It's a real quiet world out there sometimes.

Oh, and since we've made so much headway recently, we'll be accelerating new Featured Artist releases to every 7 days instead of the previous 10 days. More music, more often. Exciting, huh?
