Summoning all fruit catchers: the osu!catch World Cup is back for its 11th instalment!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2022/img/cwc2022_banner.jpg)

The osu!catch World Cup brings with it a slew of changes — from the tournament format to the pool structure, no stone has been left unturned. Teams will play a Qualifier stage, where 9 maps will decide the who dashes to the top seeds for a Round of 32, double-elimination bracket. Furthermore, all pools after Qualifiers will feature the ubiquitous Mixed Mod bracket.

For more details on these changes, please refer to the **[osu!catch World Cup 2022 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2022)**. You can discuss this event and follow the most important changes in the **[official discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1562118)** or at the public **[community server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H)**.
