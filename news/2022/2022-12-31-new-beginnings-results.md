Welcome in 2023 with the results of the New Beginnings Art Contest, now available on a main menu near you!

Throughout time immemorial, some people have proudly and grandiosely claimed that 'every end is a new beginning'. And so, as 2022 fades into memory (thank goodness), we stand on the precipice of a new and exciting year with everything that brings.

Which in this case, is a new set of Art Contest finalists to start with!

Thanks to the exhaustive efforts of **4273** unique voters, **19** finalists have been decided, with 15 from the initial voting and an extra 4 as chosen by the CEO of circles himself.

Let's get stuck straight into things — and remember, you can click any banner to be taken to a full-size version of the art in all of its glorious quality.

Welcoming in 2023 with **2203** votes (we can't make this stuff up, honestly) is [**Dreamxiety**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233)'s rendition of a kimono-clad pippi enjoying a sparkler amidst a sea of stars and floating lanterns!

Here's the official count of Dreamxiety's wins so far: *many*. And with a style like this, it's not hard to see why. Well done!

**2045** voters stumbled into [**torekka**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25130329) capturing a candid moment between pippi and Mocha, all set to a backdrop of fantastical fireworks. Getting swept up in things is definitely on brand for these two.

The new year festivities bloom in full with [**Nimiru**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11041959)'s take on a gorgeous Eastern-themed celebration. **2029** voters approved.

The traditional media feel on this one is a rare treat!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/Novarece.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/Novarece.png)

**1944** voters cheered on [**Novarece**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18728833)'s take on pippi, Mocha and Maria (in her old costume) enjoying some cake on a lake to welcome in the new year. That's all that's going on in this picture.

Do not look at the walls of the boat. Do not look under the table.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/ZunK.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/ZunK.png)

**1936** voters could not resist [**ZunK**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1070783)'s pippi and Mocha welcoming them to a fantastical new years celebration. 2022 might've given us a new keyboard meta, but maybe 2023 is going to give us a new art meta in pippi with hair buns and bells.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/Kwms024.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/Kwms024.png)

[**Kwms024**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11516014) pulled out all the stops in this Zodiac-infused masterpiece, earning the acclaim of **1924** voters. The banner really does not do this one justice, so we *highly* recommend clicking the banner to see it in full, or just checking it out in-game.

Simply glorious!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/Nemururin.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/Nemururin.png)

**1912** voters joined in the festive firework awe with [**Nemururin**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26391825)'s rendition of pippi, Mocha, Yuzu and a don enjoying the scenery.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/Son_Goku.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/Son%20Goku.png)

A crowd of **1693** voters joined [**Son Goku**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14991975)'s pippi, Mocha, Chirou and a don in perusing through some festive stalls for future fortunes. Well, two of them at least. Mocha's rocking a sparkler with mischief in her eyes and the don beside her clearly knows what's up.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/ksenikust.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/ksenikust.png)

[**ksenikust**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8938068) goes clean, crisp and retro-future in their rendition of an insanely stylish pippi to the approval of **1660** voters. The colour work on this piece is phenomenal. Absolutely outstanding work!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/RedcXca.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/RedcXca.png)

[**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601) decrees that Alisa's time to shine is right now, and **1404** voters agreed. Her base outfit really does fit the occasion, doesn't it?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/Kitcat.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/Kitcat.png)

[**Kitcat**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30329028)'s iconic style returns to the glee of **1168** voters, showcasing a delightful festive dinner that has it all and even more if you take the time to look!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/MyAngelNeptune.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/MyAngelNeptune.png)

**1156** voters could not refuse [**MyAngelNeptune**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5290308)'s pippi and her invitation to witness the scintillating sky and its many sights.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/nooders.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/nooders.png)

[**nooders**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21078517) totally ran with the 'mascots on your desk' thing to the joy of **1122** voters, and quite literally, drew mascots on a desk. Tiny, adorable mascots, including a Mocha that fits in a spoon and pippi plus Aiko admiring either a don-hammer or a don-lollipop. The don does not know how to feel about this development. This is how things should be for the don.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/McFriedFries.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/McFriedFries.png)

**1120** voters yielded to the might of [**McFriedFries**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12694139)'s take on a festive hotpot, complete with pippi, Mocha, Chirou, and an ominously-approaching rendition of the Dean "peppy" Herbert in his secret new year hoodie.

We don't know how you got snaps from inside his wardrobe, but clearly the world is better off for it.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/%5Dw%5B.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/%5Dw%5B.png)

[**\]w\[**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16964067) swept **1038** voters away in a sea of festive osu!-themed motifs. It's all here. pippi, Tama (rejoice, fans of this less-seen community mascot, this writer included), cats of a white variety, freely diving slimes, questionably-branded energy drinks and well-adored osu! peripherals. Plus a lot more, which you'll find out for yourself!

## peppy picks

Continuing on from previous contests, the Dean "peppy" Herbert himself decreed that the following four artworks will make it to the main menu because he likes them. Unsurprisingly, they're pretty likeable, so we think he's on to something.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/AyoLie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/AyoLie.png)

[**AyoLie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29186645)'s entry originally impressed **711** voters, but really left a mark with peppy, who greatly appreciated how closely the piece stuck to the theme of "new beginnings" and really ran with it. Or sailed with it, as it were.

Accordingly, this piece has set a course straight for the main menu!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/papricot.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/papricot.png)

[**papricot**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21682501)'s subdued piece caught the eye of **173** voters, but also drew peppy to think of a quiet moment alone to reflect on the past, while being hopeful for everything that is to come.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/Fluffy%20Megumi.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/Fluffy%20Megumi.png)

[**Fluffy Megumi**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27752612)'s monochrome artistry impressed **88** voters and peppy both, the latter stating that he very much appreciated the contrast to the typically colourful entries that people go for, and how happy both pippi and Mocha seem!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/banners/nhiil.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/160/winners/nhiil.png)

[**nhiil**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15284486)'s piece earned **158** votes and the approval of the Dean himself. When asked why, he said two words: "lovely cityscape". And it is indeed lovely!
