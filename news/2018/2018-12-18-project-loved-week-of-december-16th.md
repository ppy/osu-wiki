Ready for another round of [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)? Come check out the new candidates, and vote for the ones that you'd like to see in the Loved category!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)

Welcome back to [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120)! Every two weeks, we pick out a few beatmaps from each game mode that will get their shot at making it into the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). From the maps we selected, you can now vote whether or not you want them to be Loved! Click on each map's header image in this post to be taken to its voting thread.

Once again, we're seeing a change in the number of picks for certain modes this week! osu!taiko is bumping up its map count to **five**, one more than the four of previous rounds. In the opposite direction, osu!mania will actually be skipping out on picking maps this time due to community concerns—please see the note from the captains in the [osu!mania section](#osu!mania) of this post!

Also, just to clarify something about the format of these posts: the writers of the beatmap descriptions are *not necessarily* the people that chose the map, though that's often the case. If you have concerns about a particular map being nominated, please contact the whole set of captains associated with the map's game mode, preferably through the `#osu-loved` channel in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

In case you don't read the end of this post, be sure to submit suggestions for beatmaps to be added to Loved using the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbgHOVqMF8wQQKSdddW1JhC10ff6C7fb4JbEW7PBQTn9gAqg/viewform)! All of the nominated beatmaps are chosen from submissions on this form, which you can view in the corresponding [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HgHwtO3kIzT8R4ocEJMZTosADrGJRJOFL-TZI97tZS4/edit#gid=0).

[B-Complex - Beautiful Lies](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/137804#osu) by [galvenize](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/381444)\
*written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

This is the result of a pillar of mapping meeting a drum'n'bass anthem. galvenize's mapping just never gets old, with his signature awkward aim and rhythmic DnB patterning fusing with the banger of a song to create a marathon you could run forever and never get tired of. With 112 favourites at the time of writing, I'm sure you'll agree that this map is a classic and deserves all the love it receives.

*written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

A familiar song in a familiar style, this mapset of yuikonnu's cover of Ghost Rule is a two-map bundle from AtHeoN. Both maps are similar in style and star rating, featuring large jumps and streams in the clean AtHeoN style we've come to know and enjoy. The easier of the two, Lies, is the original map, and the harder, Deceit, is a remap from around six months later. Which one do you prefer? Give them a play and find out!

This will be a pleasant surprise to all K-pop fans out there, as we have a song from COSMIC GIRLS up for a spot in Project Loved! This map features four different difficulties ranging from 4 to 6 stars, so there is a little something for everyone. Its highest difficulty, although being in the low 6-star range, is a great way for players to challenge their raw aim skill, as the map has plenty of fullscreen jumps for players to test themselves. This is the type of map that always seems to draw you back because of how catchy it is. Don't believe me? Give it a go and vote for its place here in Project Loved!

[Anne-Marie - Ciao Adios (Decoy! Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/576702#osu) by [ohad1881](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3656068)\
*written by [BeasttrollMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691)*

It's been a hot while since we had a map from ohad1881, but that changes today! The creator of "Dead to Me", one of the most popular Loved beatmaps, ohad returns to Project Loved with his take on a remix of Anne-Marie's Ciao Adios. ohad is known for making extremely aim-heavy maps, similar to many Arles difficulty maps that I'm sure you're all too familiar with. This map is no different. What makes this better is the absolute banger of a song this is mapped to. If you're looking for good tunes, then look to further!

[dj TAKA - Colors -sasakure.UK Futurelogic Remix-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/214046#osu) by [captin1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/689997)\
*written by [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)*

Colors, remixed by sasakure.UK, is probably one of the most addictive songs I have ever heard, and accompanied by a map from a mapper of such caliber as captin1, there's no way to resist playing it like a maniac for at least a few days straight. If you enjoy low-BPM streams, then you've come to the right place, because this map offers just that, being exactly 150 BPM and using a ton of incredibly flowy jumpstreams. I have nothing else to say; this is pure joy to the ears and to the fingers!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-12-16-project-loved-week-of-december-16th/osu/megalara-garuda.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/843148)

[SYUNN - Megalara Garuda](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/536607#osu) by [Callionet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717), [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717) and [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699)\
*written by [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917)*

Megalara Garuda is a mapset not for the faint-hearted. Callionet's set consists of three highly-demanding maps, the most difficult of them (made by rustbell) reaching almost 8 stars in difficulty, and the other two, made by fanzhen0019 and Callionet, not falling short behind. The difficulties offer a wide range of technical patterns: unusually-spaced streams, uncomfortable angles and hyper-velocity sliders used in rustbell's map, short but deadly kicksliders that fanzhen's symmetry-driven difficulty revolves around, and finally a bit of both in Callionet's creation. Passing at least one of these maps will surely be a success for most. Will it be for you?

*written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

Some of you may know the ranked mapset of this song made by [byfar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4674054), but if you've ever wished for a map of the song with more modern difficulty settings, Shifu Touka has just what you're looking for. The mapset contains one 7-star difficulty at an approach rate of 9.6, compared to the ranked set's top difficulty being only 9. Regarding the map itself, there's a perfect balance between slow build-up sections and lengthy jump sections, all structured masterfully and backed up perfectly by the song itself. If you're a fan of the ranked set and want a fresh, modern experience for the song, or if you're just a fan of maps that can push your jump aim control to its limits, check out the map and vote for its place in the Loved category!

[Camellia - Break The Silence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/452285#osu) by [Zaiten](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6482589)\
*written by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

You probably know Camellia for his high-tech, intense electronic compositions, but do you know him for his ambient breakcore tracks such as Break The Silence? The atmosphere of the song was captured beautifully in Zaiten's 7-star beatmap, featuring stamina-draining kiai sections made to test your limits at 220 BPM. At a length just shy of five minutes, you may find your hands worn out by the end of it... or not! If you're a fan of high BPM stream control and stamina, there's no doubt you'll love this map.

*written by [SoraRoxas01](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1986262)*

If you have ever played Sing's maps, you know them to be very slider heavy and technical. If that's the types of maps you enjoy, then why not try this one for size? This Ultimate Ascension mapset is full of high-velocity sliders and spaced triples, as well as long streams at a high BPM that will test your stamina and finger control. Even with the map being just under two minutes, it's not a map to be taken lightly, and it will trip you up if you aren't careful. Another nice addition is the two different difficulties, one with 2B sliders and one without, so pick the one that suits you the most!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-12-16-project-loved-week-of-december-16th/osu/hanabira-irus-brutalcore-breaks-remix.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/843152)

*written by [SoraRoxas01](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1986262)*

Another spicy Yusomi mapset has appeared for Loved voting! Yusomi has mapped this quite fitting to the remix of the song, where it is brutal, but fun to play. With very fast sliders throughout the song, large jumps, spaced streams and bursts, this map will definitely be hard to pass for most people. Even with the difficulty of the map being 7.2 stars, there are two different difficulties that cater to people that prefer to read either AR 9.5 or AR 10. Will your fingers be able to survive the whole six minutes of this map while enjoying this great song?

[ARM vs uno - Shoujo Satori no Satorittaa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/507946#taiko) by [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672)\
*written by [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110)*

One of katacheh's best maps, this comes from an era in his maps that focused on more simplistic mapping tricks, in lieu of [Cirno's Perfect Math Class](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/481441) in both music choice as well. This should feel immediately familiar for fans of Cirno's, as the tricks here are similar, like the bar-lines corresponding with kats. It's very fun for intermediate players and those who aren't immediately familiar with obscure gimmicks, and it's quite different from maps belonging to kata's later "kata"logue!

*written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

This time around we have M1R4CL3 M1M1K4, by 7\_7, KitajimaYN and yyyyyyyyyyypetu. This is a really catchy song that will most likely keep sounding in your head for days with really masterful mapping, especially on the guest diffs. It also features a really good Oni diff that feels really well-designed, as well as a hellish top diff that will for sure attract a lot of players to try and get a nice score.

*written by [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110)*

A S a n d classic, featuring all of his normal quirks like rapid SV changes and quite dense patterning for the time, "A Young Girl" set a high standard for how high-BPM maps should be mapped at the time! The patterns used are very fun, fluid and lend easily to players who find themselves wanting to learn how to play with a full-alternating style. This is a great addition for Loved, and the song is very catchy and energetic to boot, so we think you'll have a lot of fun with this one!

*written by [Backfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/263110)*

If I were given a choice to pick what map I found the most impressive, artistic and interesting from 2018, I would have to choose this map from zkane2. The use of bar lines in this map is impeccable, and with the attention to detail in how even the playfield and characters react to shifts in BPM, it is truly something you must see to understand. The music is represented so beautifully by the cute tricks and mapping that has been employed here. The first time I played it, I truly fell in love with this map. I thought "there is no way I could have come up with the creativity that was needed to make this in 1000 years," and I hope that others will feel the same about this underrated masterpiece.

*written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

Pavor Nocturnus really has quite a background, as not only was it featured in TWC 2018 as one of the Finals No Mod picks, it also had a lot of competition (as you can see on its map description), where a lot of really good players tried their best to get nice scores in a map with a style really ahead of its time. With extremely hard-to-read patterns and the constant use of finishers that might catch you off-guard, Pavor Nocturnus really is one of the most satisfactory maps to get a good score in. Good luck!

[Ata - Euphoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/614510#fruits) by [Razor Sharp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261)

By many seen as one of the, if not the very best creations of Razor Sharp, Euphoria has made its way into loved vote to bring a euphoric mood to all. With this very clean-styled map, Razor Sharp manages to tick almost all of the boxes: lots of streams, some jumps and a very intense (despite being nerfed) 1/3 section. Despite this map having had some failed attempts at getting ranked, the quality and difficulty is still very high, and much comparable to other Razor Sharp maps such as burn this moment into the retina of my eye (if not better), which is ranked.

Euphoria also provides quite a lot of mod combinations to be done, despite its difficulty being quite high. Hard Rock is something that the top-end players could be able to pull off, and Hidden is pretty accessible to higher-end players, despite the 1/3 section becoming even harder. All in all, plenty of time can be put into this map without you getting bored, so go check it out!

[Morimori Atsushi - Tits or get the fuck out!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/590547#fruits) by [rew0825](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2488026)

The CWC created the "togtfo" meme, the OWC polished it, and this map will finish the job. Entering the Loved section vote is rew0825's rendition of "Tits or get the fuck out!!"! The map is made in a fairly standard style, with very good attention to musical detail thanks to some very fun-to-play snaps throughout the map, complemented by streams and some jumps that are not too crazily hard. The map is fairly accessible to most of the active osu!catch playerbase, and offers a great experience with Hard Rock and Hidden as well, if you wanna spice things up, that is.

The catchy song will definitely help with replayability, as well as the fact that the map isn't too long. In my opinion, it is a lot of fun to play; I enjoyed playing this in CWC and did play it a few times after in solo and multiplayer as well. Go download this wonderful piece!

## osu!mania

There are no candidates for osu!mania this week. Here is a note from [stupud man](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2141612), one of the osu!mania captains, about the situation:

> In light of recent events, we have decided to forego any picks for this wave. There are several signs that make it very clear that we should be focusing our attention on improving our nominations along with community involvement.

We will be taking the next two weeks actively reading and responding to any comments related to the osu!mania side of Project Loved, so please join and bring up any concerns you guys might have. Any concerns regarding Project Loved expressed in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) will also be considered. Thank you!
