Hello everyone, Tasha here again for our fourth installment of the osu!weekly! We've had a pretty nice week here, especially with April fools having come and gone. With a nice week comes nice news, so read on to see the latest ongoings in the osu! community!

Get your catchers ready boys and girls, as the _[osu! Catch the Beat World Cup registrations are now officially open!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-04-02-osu-catch-the-beat-world-cup-2015-registrations)_ Registrations will be open until the 19th of April, so be sure to get your registration in before then if you want to play for your country! Just be sure to _[read the rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2015#ruleset)_, as they have been changed since the previous Catch the Beat World Cup.

_[Taiko World Cup has moved into the finals of the winners bracket](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/279723)_. Quite a few teams were eliminated this week. The teams eliminated in the losers bracket round of 8 are Germany, Poland, Argentina and Finland. In the loser bracket quarterfinals we saw China and Canada be eliminated. If you missed the matches, you can always check out the _[semi-final recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALMrQ0GUmhY)_ done by ztrot, deadbeat, FLANKs and Two Fruit Cakes for a quick overview. For more bracket information about the teams moving on, you can take a look at the _[bracket](https://w.ppy.sh/2/27/TWC-Bracket.jpg)_ hosted on the wiki. You can also find the _[match schedule](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2015#match-schedule)_ for this weekend on the wiki so you know when your favourite team is playing. As always, be sure to _[tune in](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive)_ this weekend to catch both the winners and losers bracket final to see which two teams move on to the grand finals next week!

_[If you're looking for technical support, you'll now be looking towards the newly renamed Help forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5)_. You now have the options to post a new question by clicking on the "Ask the Community" button, or get live help with the "Chat with Support" option. Be sure to check it out if you have any bugs or errors you're having trouble with.

_[A new language channel, \#balkan, has been added to the game as a completed feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/152009&start=0)_. If you're part of the Balkan Peninsula, be sure to put the channel to good use by opening it and chatting with your fellow players!

For those who may have missed April fools, you missed your chance to help peppy get his private jet with osu!coins, this years April fools prank. There's _[a whole news announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-03-31-osucoins)_ on it, as well as _[a wonderful osu!academy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=BImc5McuK1o)_ describing it that you should definitely take a look at if you haven't already!

_[The OSST 2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/271653)_, a 1v1 osu!standard tournament run by _[\[ Evil \]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3801463)_, has the loser bracket finals coming up for it this weekend. Be sure to follow the thread to get times for matches and hopefully _[catch the streamed matches](https://www.twitch.tv/osstlive)_ on their stream.

_[The 2nd Australian / New Zealand osu!standard tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/309684&start=0)_, a 1v1 tournament run by _[Happyjon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5543)_, is starting this weekend. If you'd like to cheer on the players participating, be sure to check out the match schedule in the linked thread so you know when to _[tune into the tournament stream](https://www.twitch.tv/anztlive)_. In case you happen to miss matches you want to see, the _[tournament bracket](https://binarybeast.com/x1503249/)_ is available and should be updated after every weekend.

Have you been looking for a way to take a look at the stats of a player on the go? _[osu!Rank](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/133966&start=0)_ is a multi-language, auto-updating android mobile app developed by _[givenameplz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/947499)_ that is great for doing this. Take a look at rank, performance, accuracy and any other stat you could want to look at for yourself or other players with your android phone with ease.

Do you use reddit? If so, there's a _[new osu! reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/osucommunity/)_ made by _[dkun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/154400)_ and _jesus1412_ which is aimed towards small osu! related stories and content where community and staff can post together.

A sneak peak into osu!next this week gives us a quick look into _[new design elements for the taiko game mode](http://osunext.tumblr.com/post/115371776988/again-no-prizes-for-guessing-this-correctly-have)_. There is also a _[really cool preview of the new forums](http://osunext.tumblr.com/post/115384460628/the-super-early-ultra-alpha-buggy-read-only-of-the)_ brought up there, which can be found _[here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums)_.
