Time to journey through the previous year and crown the skins that stole the spotlight!

2025 wasn't an especially eventful year for skinning. Still, the skinners have been cooking up their best skins, as always. Now it's your turn to browse the [skinship compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/) and cast your votes for the best skins of the year!

Unlike previous years, 2025 did not yield a skinning contest. However, we were able to finally satisfy a demand that has been fundamentally needed for all novice skinners: a comprehensive skinning tutorial series!

Thanks to the tremendous effort of ::{ flag=PL }:: [Redo\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7122165), we have launched the first 3 episodes of the **skinship osu! skinning tutorial**, a video series that covers everything from the basics of skin creation to in-depth guides for specific elements. If you're not sure where to begin, the introduction episode is right below. Grab something to drink and tune right in!

That said, there is still much to cover. More tutorial videos will follow, so be sure to keep tabs on the [skinship YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/@skinship)!

With 2025's skinning recap complete, it's time to go through the voting details.
