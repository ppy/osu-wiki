It is that time of the year again: get ready as the underdogs battle it out in the 8th iteration of the 3 Digit World Cup!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/3WC/2026/img/banner.jpg)

The **[3 Digit World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2169669?n=1)**, or 3WC for short, as per tradition since 2019, is here for the 3 digits (#100–999) to show what they're capable of! If you wanted to see who can ride the high from the osu! World Cup and keep up tempo, or learn which players to look out for during the rest of the year, you're in the right place.

[Last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-04-02-3-digit-world-cup-2025-concludes), while not record-breaking, still managed a whopping 26 countries fielding teams, including 5 merges: Baltics (::{ flag=EE }:: Estonia, ::{ flag=LV }:: Latvia, ::{ flag=LT }:: Lithuania), Imperio Rioplatense (::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina, ::{ flag=UY }:: Uruguay), Iberia (::{ flag=ES }:: Spain, ::{ flag=PT }:: Portugal), Austria-Hungary (::{ flag=AT }:: Austria, ::{ flag=HU }:: Hungary) and Oceania (::{ flag=AU }:: Australia, ::{ flag=NZ }:: New Zealand) tallying up to 32 unique countries in this rather small rank range.

Of course, we didn't fall short on the storylines either: ::{ flag=GR }:: Greece passed a qualifier stage for the first time in any world cup, both community and official in every mode, mainly on the shoulders of ::{ flag=GR }:: [JackPaX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11226645) being the [5th best overall performer of the qualifier stage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TtfjUBgCOLTyZORO6sjDClSiuhFwcp2DV73I5o4lBqA?gid=970518568#gid=970518568), as well as an insane bracket run from Austria-Hungary, seeding 15th from qualifiers but finishing in the top 8 after getting seed upsets against ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland (#10) and ::{ flag=RO }:: Romania (#12).

Once again, reigning champions ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea managed to take down the ::{ flag=US }:: United States in the Grand Finals, but only after coming back from the losers' bracket and winning [7–1 initially](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/117495377) but going the distance in the bracket reset the week after, [setting a 6–6 tie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/117566226) and forcing the tiebreaker on [sugosugiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/442)'s original song [Zyphorath Quixalune](https://soundcloud.com/sugosugiii/zyphorath-quixalune), acquiring their fourth title and third consecutive win in 3WC. This match, as well as everything since 2021, can be viewed on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@3wc_osu) if you're looking for a refresher!

## How do I register?

Please note that teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded. **The deadline for registering is January 25, 18:00 UTC. Make sure to submit yours before it's too late — no exceptions will be made.**

*Notice: To participate, you must be ranked #100–999 on the osu! global ranking and must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the past 12 months.*

All countries with at least 3 eligible registrants will have one player designated as the captain by the organisers. The captain is then responsible for selecting and submitting a roster of 3–6 players to represent their country in the tournament. Countries with more than 6 candidates are encouraged to host tryouts for their team to aid in selecting the best players.
