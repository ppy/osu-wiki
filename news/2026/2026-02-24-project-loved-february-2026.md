Project Loved is back to make your February even lovelier!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Another month, and another new year! We hope you are all having a great February, whichever new year you celebrate. For those who may be new here, or need a refresher, here's what we do: Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll. Alternatively you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

Following last month's proposal, the osu! gamemode captains (that is, the circle clickers) are implementing some changes on their approach to picking maps. Here's a message from them explaining the details:

> Project Loved for osu! is undergoing an overhaul to its curation system. Since 2023, we’ve relied on a category-based approach to determine our picks. Over time, however, we’ve noticed growing dissatisfaction with certain categories, both in overall popularity and player reception. **Rather than continually adding and removing categories to match what we think fits the current playerbase, we’re abolishing them entirely and returning to a more freeform approach**, relying on the capabilities of our new Captains to ensure that the maps all bring something different to the table. We’re confident in our ability to deliver a unique set of maps that don’t need to adhere to an arbitrary list of requirements, and we hope you’ll place your trust in us as we bring beautiful maps to the section.

*description written by [BATBALL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15173952)*

What's up osu!, welcome to February. I'm here to introduce you to our month's picks. Starting off, we have our first slot of the month, *Popular Pla*\- oh wait... 📞📞 What's that? I'm getting word that [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656) just killed Project Loved slots. Wowww. Thank you chiv. NO ONE is surprised...

With the new captain category system, get ready to vote on and play an even more diverse range of maps, free of the parameter chains that previously bound them, all curated by our twelve wonderful captains!

To start off with my first pick in this new system, I nominated [ZUTOMAYO - Humanoid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2110847#osu) mapped by [chests](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14806365). Sitting at 8.25★, it's no wonder this map was featured in [Corsace Closed 2024](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1906592?n=1) as a NM3. This map features a unique and active take on this song, resulting in an incredibly fun alt-map challenge tailored for the most skilled players of this skill set. The wonderful mapper of this song wanted to shout out the [previously loved Meg mapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/972298#osu/2035761) of the same song, which inspired him to make his rendition of this song! Make sure to check that set out if you can't handle the heat of this 8-star challenge.

Make sure to cast your YES votes on this month's loved poll for this map, and also wish chests a happy birthday once December 29th rolls around again!!!

[LOONA - Hi High (Sewerslvt Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1827351#osu) by [kevjn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5735327), [an3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11954090), and [velamy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15538779)\
194 BPM, 3:28 | 2.71★, 4.18★, 6.11★, 6.68★\
*description written by [Bernkastel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5154946)*

It's February already and we've got yet another month of bangers nominated for Loved, this time bringing you [LOONA - Hi High (Sewerslvt Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1827351#osu/3750192) mapped by [kevjn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5735327), [an3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11954090) and [velamy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15538779)!

Taking this absolute icon of a K-pop song by LOONA, backed up with [Sewerslvt](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/169)'s complex and gloomy sound, results in an ethereal-sounding track that makes you feel like you're soaring through outer space. The mapset represents that very well.

You have the choice of four difficulties, ranging from 2.7★ to 6.68★, meaning that this mapset will have a difficulty everyone can appreciate and challenge themselves on.

Being mostly slider-focused, this map dares you to try and follow its slider shapes in order to maintain as much accuracy as possible. The aim requirement is absolutely nothing to scoff at, and you can find yourself tripping up easily.

Make sure to warm up properly, do some stretches and of course vote for this map to get Loved!

[ATOLS - Omega (Atols Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/281975#osu) by [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328)\
140 BPM, 3:17 | 5.58★\
*description written by [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552)*

[rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328), a legendary player you must have heard of as a certified osu! gamer, is not only ahead of his time in the gameplay scene but also in mapping. While most of his maps are popular candidates for the Loved section, this month's pick, [ATOLS - Omega (Atols Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/281975#osu/637823), might be a hidden gem that has fallen under the radar.

[ATOLS - Omega (Atols Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/281975#osu/637823) was created back in 2015, which by no means is aged. This map is something I would describe as "simplicity at its best": simple yet effective patterning, slider velocity usages that capture the song perfectly, and other aspects you enjoy in a simple tech map, all presented along with the unique vocastep song.

Words can't describe how underappreciated this map is, so make sure to give it a go. And don't forget to show your love for this creation by voting yes ~~and purposefully missing the last note in tribute to [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328)~~!

Hey [BATBALL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15173952)! Everyone's gonna crash out when we remove their beloved categories. We might just have to bust out the secret weapon to make sure the players are at least a little happy.

That's right. With the latest osu!(lazer)™ technology, we don't have to be worried about force-fails anymore in this system. [IOSYS - Endless Tewi-ma Park](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/90935#osu/246410) is finally getting its rightful shot at Project Loved. For those (somehow) unaware of this map, it's the founding father of the 2B concept, a Gameplay Gimmick (haha, get it) where you have to (typically) hold down one key while you tap with the other. If that doesn't really make any sense, our good friend [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983) might be able to [show you the ropes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvlbwQXnd0c).

If the 2B concept isn't really your thing, make sure to try the ⭐Dodge The Beat⭐ difficulty so you can larp as a Touhou player 💖💖 And for *that* part of the community... I guess you guys can have the spinner diff... 🙄🙄

This is just the start of some ✨magic✨ we'll be bringing to the table in 2026. If you're excited to see more, make sure to vote yes!!

*description written by [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656)*

Another beautiful map for a beautiful section.

Originally intended to be his final map, [Cochma](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2237460#osu/4754031) stands as a culmination of [Halgoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4109923)'s vision and craftsmanship. Now finding its way into Project Loved, it showcases his masterful slider design and refined visual spacing, blending intricate patterns with deliberate movement that fully embodies his distinctive mapping style. This 7★ tech-focused challenge demands exceptional aim control, precise flow tracing, and sharp density reading, skills that only the strongest tech players truly possess.

Vote yes!

*description written by [Petal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7354729)*

Streams... AND CATGIRLS??

For those of you who weren't around during 2021, allow me to introduce you [MisomyL - Ring ! Run ! Nyan!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1536674#osu/3141960) mapped by [Fisky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8352623). Originating from [Corsace Open 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1364543?n=1) as a Qualifiers NM2, this meowvelous map features many accelerating and decelerating flow aim streams mapped to purrfection!

If you ever wanted to test your stream skills against a very wholesome tournament NM2, then I can guarantee this map is definitely meant for you. However, I would advise a short warm-up session beforehand...

Although the correlation between the song and catgirls remains meowsterious, what is known is that this map is super fun and amazing, and you should definitely vote YES!!!

680 BPM, 7:56 | 8.78★, 10.32★\
*description written by [plambob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077431)*

With a new way forward when it comes to nominating mapsets for Loved, I'd like to introduce what I want to bring to the table with [Freethinker - 680 BPM Born Slippy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/876995#osu) by [TheKushVanMan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3409977). Kush is no stranger to creating some absurdly difficult maps, and 680 BPM *Born Slippy* is by no means an exception, harbouring two difficulties, an 8★ and 10★, of this almost 8 minute gauntlet respectively.

Regardless of which difficulty you pick, the patterns and sheer consistency you need to demonstrate to just scrape by with a pass cannot be understated. This mapset throws what is the equivalent to 340 BPM jumps at you relentlessly for up to minutes at a time. You need to be the best of the best.

Excited to see how the best players in the game perform on this map? Help get this map a leaderboard and a place in the Loved Category by voting "Yes"!

Coming directly from the [OWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024) Quarterfinals, [Azrulk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046612) and [Ishtiaq](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6405262)'s rendition of [IMANU & KUCKA - It's Our Destiny (Cuepric Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2278186#osu/4855557) is a map crafted to push your slider-following skills to their absolute limits.

Accompanied by an insanely smooth and atmospheric DnB track, this NM4 delivers a stunning visual spectacle through complex slider shapes, flowing movement, and some rhythmic control. Every section is carefully designed to be a test of tech skill, even for the very best players.

Whether you're chasing leaderboard placements, sharpening your mechanics, or simply enjoying a beautifully constructed tech map, this map offers a unique experience from start to finish. If you think you have what it takes to rise to the challenge, it's YOUR destiny to vote YES on this map's poll.

Poland rise, *ROGAL DDL feat. SZYMON TUR & WOWO - EBE EBE* by [Piggey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4163860) will finally have a shot at Project Loved this month.

You might be familiar with this song and map from 2016/17, made especially iconic in the osu! community by [Rafis reading the lyrics in 2017](https://youtube.com/watch?v=xqZA6ihDcWQ) (warning: explicit content). Here is also a [video of Rafis FCing this very map](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QGaCGEJsoW0).

In any case, this map is a generic aim test with some bursts littered in (nowadays, this would be called a "hybrid" map). Piggey does well at expressing this song while making it engaging and fun.

If you have ever followed or participated in [Corsace Open 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1794106?n=1) in any way, this particular custom NM1 by [Fsjallink](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12704035) might be very familiar to you!

What you almost certainly aren't familiar with, however, is the approach to difficulty compared to the rest of his maps. He's most known for his 4- or 5-star maps, and this exception to the rule stands at above 7 stars! It's mostly just your standard aim practice, with a shift from 160 BPM to 170 BPM in the middle to ramp up the intensity just a little and give it some nuance.

If you want to give Indian music more leaderboard representation (there has basically been none in the past 17 years), vote yes on NAAAAATU NAATU NAATU NAATU NAATU NAATU NAATU.

[BOOGEY VOXX - D.I.Y (Lux-PSMT Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1778845#taiko/3643139) mapped by [hoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9503098) and [ler1211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19901680) is not only one of the most iconic maps in the Japanese community, but its recognition has extended to the tournament scene, seeing appearances in Taiko Team Festival's mappool, capturing the hearts of many players.

The catchy ad-libs accompanying bass that hits super hard make this song unforgettable, not to mention the map itself being very anti-mod for both Hidden and Hard Rock. Players during the tournament praised this map for being a very well suited pick for tourney play as well. hoku and ler surely are crowd-pleasers!

Whether you've had fun playing this map before or seen this map for the first time just now, make sure you go give it a run either way. And if you enjoyed it, cast that "yes" vote to see it get Loved!

Featured in [TWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024) as the [Grand Finals HR1](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024#grand-finals), [Memme - Acid Burst](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1048233#taiko) by [goheegy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8057655) is a splendid example of a map that is able to truly test your Hard Rock skills without relying on high BPM or absurd scroll speed changes. Because of its burst-heavy patterning and tasteful SV usage, this map is always a blast to play. Even if you decide not to play it with any mods on, there's no wrong way to experience this!

Are you ready for Nonstop Kaiten-speed? This month, [Katagiri - Nonstop Kaiten-zushi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/904117#taiko/1887352) by [rezi888](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2337821) is up for Loved voting! Nonstop is an apt title for this, with [rezi888](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2337821) fitting 2393 notes into 4 minutes of constant 250 BPM patterns with very little room for rest! Despite this, [Nonstop Kaiten-zushi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/904117#taiko/1887352) mostly features patterns on the shorter side (with most patterns consisting of 3–9 notes), making it ideal practice for those training high-BPM bursts and consistency!

Give it a go and see how your speed, stamina and consistency hold up!

If you were to hunt for hip-hop maps in the Loved category, you'd hit a dead end rather quickly, especially if you are looking for a full spread. However, [Cash Shit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1947353#taiko) by [Nifty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4956097) is here to change that!

Despite SV maps usually being associated with Inner Oni difficulties and above, [Cash Shit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1947353#taiko) offers multiple difficulties to practice your reading regardless of skill level! Low scroll speed mixed with ninja finishers is the name of the game, and if you're too slow to react to them, you might find yourself in a chain-miss situation! This mapset is also perfect for training your sense of rhythm, thanks to its various 1/3 and 1/4 sections.

Don't forget to vote ***"YES"*** if you want to spawn in the backrooms with Megan Thee Stallion and a DaBaby Convertible!

This is a real mechanical skill check, and casual play won't be enough to make it through... not even on Wednesday.

It is said that there exists a ballroom in which every dance becomes eternal, where each step taken remains etched into the air forever. This gala is hardly a celebration, if not of stagnation and of the refusal of the past to make room for the present.

On this beautiful moonlit night, you are invited by [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) to this spectral ballad. It will prove to be a trial of focus, forcing you to come face-to-face with its never-fading participants, and the growing, shifting, and crowded density that they compose, demanding you navigate the floor with absolute precision.

Those who wound up trapped in this twisted ritual could not make it past the brutal crowding of their vision, a frantic blur of lingering steps begging them to lose their footing and to succumb to the beautiful frenzy.

Do not stare at the ghosts; look past them. Let the clutter fade, and the patterns reveal themselves.

For the [Wicked Ceremony](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1794175#fruits/3677152) has begun.

[Sasuke Haraguchi feat. Kasane Teto - HITO Mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2127065#mania) by [Mafufu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10884561)\
150 BPM, 1:55 | 2.91★, 2.91★\
*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

As a new Loved featured mapper, [Mafufu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10884561) is another one of those very good SV players who ended up taking up mapping as well. I seem to like introducing those types every once in a while.

[HITO Mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2127065#mania) is an interesting creature. The song itself having taken the internet off-guard through its quirks, the resulting map transcribes those feelings pretty accurately. Through literal screamers and jumpscares interspersed by mechanical, abrasive stutters and transitions, *HITO Mania* packs a punch in terms of execution. Especially given Mafufu's attention to detail in terms of SV flourish.

This makes its feature within the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2024) Quarterfinals mappool even more striking, especially as it lied beside [AlexDunk's map of *sing sing red indigo*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2127152), another very particular entry among SV entries. A very cut and rigid gimmick-based option to complement a rhythmically chaotic, almost vibe-based accuracy nightmare.

Whether you have a thirst for SV or a thirst for blood, you're welcome to make that known through your vote in the forum thread. Remember to follow your local laws, however.

[Aiobahn +81 feat. Nanahira & Pmarusama - Ten Ten Tengoku Jigokukoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2324445#mania) by [Bacon Haniwa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16562681)\
140 – 196 BPM, 3:41 | 6.10★ – 8.22★\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

**Ten Ten Tengoku Jigokukoku! Tenshi to! Akuma to!**

Introducing the chordjack pick of this round, [Bacon Haniwa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16562681)'s [Ten Ten Tengoku Jigokukoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2324445#mania/4982073) focuses on being able to play charts that have a lot of quads and jumps, with the occasional hands thrown into the mix as well.

While the chart starts very light at first, it eventually introduces you to the chordjack aspects of this chart. The first half serves as a great introduction to what is about to come, allowing you to see the pattern of alternating jumps, hands, and quads, preparing you for the future sections of the chart. As the first part finishes, a long break section allows a place to recover. However, right after this, you are immediately thrown into chordjacks once again. It also starts to become denser than the first set of long chordjacks, as the presence of hands is more prominent.

Not just that, but the long anchors that are present in the chart can also make you lose your balance very easily. It does not help that at the base rate, the BPM is 140, which can lead unsuspecting players to challenges in stamina, reading, and consistency. That said, if you are able to push higher than this BPM, rates up to 1.4x are available, and it won't be surprising if many players are able to break the limits in this chart.

Honestly, this chart has a lot to offer for chordjack players, and being [Bacon Haniwa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16562681)'s first potential appearance for the Loved category, there certainly is going to be a lot in store from their charting, especially given how many charts they have. If you think that there is a lot more to offer for chordjack charts and charters alike, then it's about time to vote and discuss in the thread!

**Dead! Alive! Dead! Alive!**

190 BPM, 4:39 | 5.23★\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Sorairo Days](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/740579#mania/1562379) is a chart notorious for its jumpstreams and handstreams, and [IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951) is a name you've probably heard of for these kinds of patterns.

Very experienced 4K players certainly know [Sorairo Days](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/740579#mania/1562379) for being a great way to help players improve in the jumpstream/handstream field. What makes this chart really popular among players is how friendly and welcoming it can be, especially since the chart is structured to have light jumpstreams at the start before increasing the difficulty by the time the second chorus hits. As time passes, the jumpstreams turn into handstreams, which can make players struggle to read the chart due to its density and the stamina factor.

Many players definitely recognize this chart and have used it in their sessions to improve their reading and stamina skill sets. This chart has really been a staple of JS/HS and has been a great way for players to start and improve that skill set.

If you think that charts like these deserve to get Loved, then don't be afraid to give this a favorable vote!

*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132) is a charter notorious for their stream-y Eurobeat charts, and [Russian Lullaby](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1538061#mania/3144683) is a great example of this. Featured in the [Springtime osu!mania Free-for-all Tournament 6 (SOFT 6) Semifinals pool](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/6#semifinals) at 1.1x rate, a lot of challenges to be thrown at you are to be expected.

Being a difficult speed chart that almost lasts for 3 minutes, [Russian Lullaby](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1538061#mania/3144683) is certainly a chart that won't put you to sleep. The entire chart has a relentless barrage of streams, with anchors that can make you uncomfortable, jumps that pop out of nowhere, and only one break section, giving you only a little time to breathe with how difficult the chart is overall. Due to its length, you not only have to focus on that accuracy aspect, but also ensure that your consistency is up to par, especially with stream-y charts, as it is very easy to mess up and get a lot of bad judgments due to rushing or dragging these parts.

If you thought 1.0x was hard enough, wait 'til you see that this chart has rates up to 1.3x. As the chart becomes faster, the degree of difficulty just starts to increase even further, due to the speed/stream aspect being heavily emphasized and focused on.

Personally speaking, this chart is certainly another great one from [Jole](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2883132), and they are really able to showcase their ability to create maps that can test players in terms of their ability to play speed/stream charts. If you think so as well, or have other opinions regarding it, don't forget to make your voice heard, and vote!

[[Crz]hinako1804](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13747903) is making another return to Loved with their chart of [Tairin no Soul](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1678453#mania)!

Outside of their various packs, *Tairin no Soul* is probably their most notable charts that isn't in one, and taking a look at the chart itself makes that very clear as to why it's so notable. Being a vocal dump, it manages to stick out in many aspects for the technicality behind the snap usage, while at the same time managing to feel very, very flowy, leading to an overall smooth experience. While it does end up on the easier side, you always have access to uprates if you wish for a bigger challenge, or maybe you prefer accuracy more? Who knows!

Fans of all types of vocal dumps are sure to enjoy this regardless of their preferences. Go vote in the thread!

This year, it's happening again! Except... different song. And host. ANYWAYS! [KANKAN - Boost Anima](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2238606#mania/4756867) is getting the spotlight this month!

Featured in [MWC 4K 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K), it took up the coordination slot for the Round of 16 mappool. Funnily enough, and hence the emphasis in my first paragraph, it took up the same slot as *FUTURE EVE*, even including the same mappers! Aside from the noticeable song difference, this was rather notable for what it contained, as it had more of a "timing hell" style that we're all too familiar with when it comes to LN coordination. This was especially notable, since that specific approach to coordination wasn't something you'd see very often within easier rounds, as it was typically something you'd only come across in Finals and Grand Finals.

If you've struggled on higher-star LN maps in the past but wish to improve, this is definitely something you should try! With that said and done, give it your vote!
