A lot of early 2000s electronic music doesn't withstand the test of time. **SHK** is an exception.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/xxx/header.jpg)

Before the average osu! player was born, South Korean producer **SHK** (a.k.a. *Shin Hyun Keun* or *SoundHolicK*) was crafting tunes that would eventually become legendary to the rhythm game world. His extensive catalogue began with *O2Jam*, where song series like *Identity* and *Death Moon* gained their footing, then later spreading to other corners of the rhythm game scene like *Cytus* and *PUMP IT UP*.

Here on osu!, **SHK** has been relevant since the dawn of mapping. The one and only [James](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5728) introduced [*Identity*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1421) to osu! in the stone age, but these timeless tracks are still being mapped today, as seen by [*Identity Part 4*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2497402) (which was Ranked earlier this month!).

We'll cut to the chase: **11** classic tracks can be found on [**SHK**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/528)! Each track is pre-timed, so you can load them into the editor and start mapping on frame 1.

If you somehow haven't heard **SHK** yet, preview every part of the *Identity* series in this video, then play through multiple generations of maps further below:

Music won't map itself. Go to [**SHK**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/528) and get started. If you don't believe you can make a map, you might be lying to yourself.

What happens next? By the time you're done playing every **SHK** map and making your own, a week will have likely passed, at which point you can come back here to see our next Featured Artist!

Stay tuned.
