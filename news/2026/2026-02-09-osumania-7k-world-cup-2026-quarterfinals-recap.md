This is the beginning of the end! As the tournament reaches its halfway point, the very first osu! originals make their appearance in the tournament.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-09-osumania-7k-world-cup-2026-quarterfinals-recap/banner.jpg)

This week may very well have been one of the most exciting of this year's osu!mania 7K World Cup — triple tiebreaker during the Round of 32 notwithstanding, all with pools that are only going to get even harder from here on out. It's safe to say that players have long been done with the "tutorial" stages, and now the real fun has begun!

The stakes could not be higher, however. The longer teams retain their places in the winners' bracket going into the later rounds, the more of an advantage they'll have over their peers. Being in the losers' bracket has become a constant fight for survival!

It's time to check what the matches a week ago had to offer in detail, but for those who'd rather enjoy the recap in video form, [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), [epic man 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000), [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895), and [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622) got you covered!

![Quarterfinals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-09-osumania-7k-world-cup-2026-quarterfinals-recap/mappool-qf.jpg)

With the introduction of best-of-11 matches in the Quarterfinals, we saw two new slots being added to the pools. Both [ILusMin feat. Bob Hou - GlassyHeart.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498428#mania/5494089) (RC6) by ::{ flag=HK }:: [pwhk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4887865) and [Elliot Hsu - Celestial Intertwine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498408#mania/5494022) (LN4) by ::{ flag=AU }:: [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) made their first appearances as the first RC tech and LN inverse slots of the tournament, respectively. While this is not the only expansion of the pool that we'll experience, it certainly has been one of the most impactful ones.

In this mappool, [Sakamiya - Valkyrie Revolutia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498320#mania/5493694) (RC3) by ::{ flag=JP }:: [\[GS\]hina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20040607) was certainly one of the standout maps. Being the most picked map from the pool, players seemed to have taken a knack for the fast chordstreams slot. It's arguably a much more approachable map as opposed to the more dense or rice-heavy alternatives, due to its increased amount of breaks and rest time, but do be careful with the broken streams going into the second half of the map! 

---

Most excitingly, however, is that we saw the osu! original production team back with a first appearance of the year made during the Quarterfinals!

[witch's slave](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/522) and [kefi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/523) have made their first official appearance in osu! with the release of [Magicarissa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498429#mania/5494097). Mapped by ::{ flag=HK }:: [pwhk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4887865) and serving as the EX mixed rice slot of the pool, this chart is basically an amalgamation of all rice-related skills. Whether it's chordstreams, brackets, or streams, this map has it all — and it's not easy to play at all!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-09-osumania-7k-world-cup-2026-quarterfinals-recap/SEISHUNNO_HACKING-banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498399#mania/5493993)

The second and last original track of the round was the tiebreaker, [SEISHUN://NO_HACKING](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498399#mania/5493993) by [takehirotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/428), brought to life in beatmap form by ::{ flag=MY }:: [Mochineko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196). While it was unfortunately left unplayed during the Quarterfinals, this does not mean that you shouldn't give it a try. The map is still a ton of fun to play — it even comes with 3 sets of subtitles and a storyboard to top it off!

This week was potentially one of the most stressful for those teams unfortunate enough to be in the losers' bracket. Having to play two matches in a weekend is no easy task, and with no more leeway, the nerves only reflect the risk of immediate elimination.

Said pressure usually makes for more interesting matches, however. This was best exemplified with the match between Hong Kong and Spain, a match that was much closer than viewers may have given it credit for!

This isn't to say the winners' bracket is uninteresting. It is far from that in fact, and the match between Indonesia and Japan stands as proof:

### ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan

</div>

This was one of the most anticipated matches of the Quarterfinals: Indonesia (#4) versus Japan (#5), two titans who have already faced each other plenty of times before and have consistently delivered very exciting matches over the years. This time, both teams have fought to hell and back to secure their spot in the Finals. It was clear from the very start that this would be an intense and closely contested match that would keep viewers on the edge of their seats until the bitter end.

Indonesia with their first pick chose [Nakiri Ayame - Good-bye sengen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498334#mania/5493747) (LN3), capitalising on their long note superiority. The decision immediately paid off as they secured a quick win with a 26,633-point lead. Japan quickly responded with their protect [Cres. – Gargoyle](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498417#mania/5494049) (RC4), a slot which they've famously always protected and excelled in! Unsurprisingly, Japan took the win. Most notably, ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) delivered an impressive 998,805 score on a somewhat unorthodox chordjack chart.

At this point, many viewers expected the match to be a back-and-forth fistfight between long note and rice picks, but this was far from what ended up unfolding. When Japan chose [Sakamiya - Valkyrie Revolutia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498320#mania/5493694) (RC3), a map which should've played to their advantage, they weren't able to predict how close they would be to their opponent.

After a very quick exchange of blows, Indonesia managed to clutch a narrow victory with only an 890-point difference, winning their first break point of the match. Indonesia used this chance to further strengthen their lead by picking their protect [Hanatan – Orange](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498332#mania/5493744) (LN2) securing yet another point and extending their lead to 4–1. Props to ::{ flag=ID }:: [Onta_Bekasi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8677684) who stood out with an impressive 992,134 score on a technically demanding LN coordination chart!

Japan wasn't giving up any time soon, and began their comeback shortly after. They were able to rack up two consecutive wins, beating Indonesia in both [MetaHumanBoi - Speed Bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498327#mania/5493725) (RC1) and [RIM - Deadline Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498407#mania/5494017) (HB3) and securing a break point with a slim 1,974-point margin with the latter. Following it up with another strong rice performance from Japan, they were able to even out the score to 4–4, pushing the match dangerously close to tiebreaker territory.

Indonesia tried getting their bearings back by picking [ikaruga_nex - BLAZES ASSAULT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498336#mania/5493751) (HB1) and building a solid initial lead. But Japan fought back real hard, causing the score to flicker between both teams multiple times. Indonesia was ultimately able to hold their ground, securing victory in the very final moments with a 3,714-point difference — an extremely crucial turning point that would determine whether a tiebreaker would occur.

At their wit's end, Japan ultimately ended up choosing [Laur - Luminous Era](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498340#mania/5493805) (EX3). Initially, Indonesia held a comfortable lead, but some late misses caused their advantage to quickly shrink to an uncomfortable degree, yet despite Japan's last spurt, it was not enough to overturn the result. Indonesia ended up claiming the final win by a meager 1,078 points and denying Japan the tiebreaker!

Congratulations to Indonesia for winning an extraordinarily close and unpredictable match filled with dramatic twists from start to finish. A round of applause for Japan as well, and while they have been demoted to the losers' bracket, we are more than confident they will be able to bounce back in the rounds to come!

If you've been around community tournaments in the last few years, chances are that you've seen the name [takehirotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576). As a music producer who is well-renowned and active within the osu! community, takehirotei has assembled a [plethora of original work in osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/428) that can be measured well into the double digits.

Notably featured in the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2023), [osu!mania LN Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/3), multiple Malaysian national tournaments, and most recently in placing #2 in [Locus 2025](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025#results), takehirotei has no doubt been established as a household name among avid fans of osu!'s budding music scene.

This week, takehirotei has made a spectacular World Cup debut with the Quarterfinals tiebreaker, [SEISHUN://NO_HACKING](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498399#mania/5493993). Featuring takehirotei's genre-switching specialties and vocals from a SynthV voice bank provided by [Aitsuki Nakuru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/127), this song packs a huge punch, befitting of the first osu! original tiebreaker of the 2026 osu! World Cups.

Hello takehirotei! You make a lot of original music for osu! tournaments now; what did your osu! community involvement look like before this, and how did you start getting on this osu! music path?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/takehirotei.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794">takehirotei</a></p>

Hello! So before I started making music, I was just a regular standard-mode player who tried to farm as much pp as I could. Then, the thought of mapping a song suddenly came to me, because no one had created beatmaps of my favourite songs yet. After a year of mapping and chilling with some osu! and rhythm game players in the Comic Fiesta and osu! Malaysia Discord servers, I had a wild idea: instead of just mapping, why not make a song and map it? This became my biggest starting point in composing.

As a rhythm gamer myself, I naturally started out wanting to make songs that challenge players. I wasn't involved in many community events back then, as I was just a casual player, until the [A Labour Of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest) contest. This was probably my next biggest starting point in making osu! originals. After this contest, [Kuma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2582531) noticed me and invited me to make the [GFTB](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1524502#mania/3119221) for [OMT2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1311342?n=1). After that, [Kasumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263) noticed me as well and invited me to make a [TB](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1850782#taiko/3802036) for [EGTS2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022), and the rest of the story is just a huge domino effect leading to today.

A lot has changed in the osu! community music scene over the past few years. In what ways have you been able to observe a shift in the community's focus towards original music, and how has the growth and development of the scene affected your journey as an artist?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/takehirotei.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794">takehirotei</a></p>

From what I've observed, in the past, osu! community music for tournaments usually focused only on the song and the map, with very little involvement from the graphics side. Nowadays, graphic designers are much more involved, which allows composers to collaborate not only with mappers but also with visual artists. This creates more room for discussion and creativity, as ideas can be developed and executed from three different perspectives: music, mapping, and visuals.

This shift has had a significant positive impact on my growth as an artist. Previously, I wasn’t much of a collaborative person and preferred working on solo projects. However, after seeing how collaboration works across different tournaments, I've become much more open to working with others and embracing collaborative projects.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

Keen-eyed spectators will notice a clear source of inspiration for your new tiebreaker song. What was your main drive for the artistic direction in [SEISHUN://NO_HACKING](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498399#mania/5493993), and what was your thought process behind the elements you've chosen to represent in the song?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/takehirotei.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794">takehirotei</a></p>

The concept of [SEISHUN://NO_HACKING](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498399#mania/5493993) began in 2024 after I met [Mochineko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196) at Comic Fiesta, where he suggested exploring a vocal futurecore style if I get to make a song for MWC7K. That idea stayed with us, and in 2025, after the artist roster was finalised and the Nakuru (無來) SynthV voicebank was released, we started shaping the song more clearly. The direction fully clicked after [a certain incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDIP3ESW1Ng) occurred in Blue Archive where an in-game character seemingly took over the game, which inspired the "hacking in a school" setting. Since I was about to graduate from university, and several people involved in the project had also graduated in recent years, I decided to incorporate a graduation theme as well.

Because this is a vocal song, the lyrics were essential in delivering the concept. I drew heavily from my university experience, especially programming, by opening the song with Python-inspired "definitions" that are referenced later, alongside coding jargon to make the hacking theme stronger. Structurally, the lyrics follow a storytelling approach: the first half serves as an introduction, while the second half focuses more on storytelling elements, such as Asahi's friend entering the room, chasing each other through the school, reaching the server room, and eventually "hacking" and "restoring" their memories.

Composition wise, I aimed for an atmosphere similar to [C://YOU NEX-TIME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2028305) but at a slower BPM, blending futurecore with dubstep, drum n' bass, and full-flavour to keep the tiebreaker complex to a certain extent. The choir near the end symbolizes singing the school anthem one last time before graduation, and the phone call sounds at the beginning and end reflect a familiar school-life memory.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576">-mint-</a></p>

As someone who has produced countless works for osu! tournaments of varying scales, how do you approach making something for a tournament? How do you choose what aspects of the song to prioritise, and how does this vary between tournaments?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/takehirotei.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794">takehirotei</a></p>

I generally follow a simple rule of thumb when making tournament songs: either I make something that allows players to enjoy playing, or something that makes them suffer as much as possible. For this tiebreaker, since it's only for Quarterfinals, I decided to focus more on enjoyment. However, because it is still a tiebreaker, the difficulty needs to be there, so I chose to extend the song to around 7 minutes.

Another important decision is the genre and BPM of the song. The futurecore genre usually sits around the 160-180 BPM range from what I've observed, so I chose 179 for this tiebreaker, because it fits the genre well. This decision is also influenced by the skill level of the tournament and the round itself.

Most importantly, I think communication with the host or mappooler is essential to ensure the song fits its intended slot. This includes sending work-in-progress versions along the way and asking for feedback, so adjustments can be made early if needed.

When it comes to which aspects of the song to prioritise, I usually choose between two approaches: going full "rave mode" (a song made for pure energy and headbanging), or full "storytelling mode" (a song that progresses and tells a story over time). I usually lean more toward the storytelling approach.

## Score highlights

With the competition heating up this Quarterfinals weekend, the difficulty of the pools, expectedly, started to rise as well. In spite of the challenge, the players gave us quite a show with their performances this weekend. Here's some of the scores that definitely stood out:

- While [ILusMin feat. Bob Hou - GlassyHeart.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498428#mania/5494089) (RC6) may have not been played as much as the other charts in the category, it did not fail to give us some surprises. One of these was courtesy of Germany's 7K veteran, ::{ flag=DE }:: [TsukiyaWhiskers](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12598261), who gave us a really ridiculous 979k run on their match against Ireland.
- ::{ flag=AU }:: [oct4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10303887) showed us a reason why they are one of Australia's 7K superstars by putting out a weekend-topping 981k score on [Kirara Magic - Kirara's Atelier](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498331#mania/5493743) (LN1). This score, aside from the only one exceeding 980k, also leads by a fair margin over the second best one.
- Team Poland unfortunately bid farewell to the tournament this round, but they did not go down without a fight. Polish team captain ::{ flag=PL }:: [bagjettka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18338179) put out an amazing 988k full combo run on [RIM - Deadline Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498407#mania/5494017) (HB3). This score surely gives them a case to be placed amongst Europe's best osu!mania 7K players!
- ::{ flag=PH }:: [bojii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083439) once again showed their amazing rice proficiency by topping this round's scores on [witch's slave vs. kefi - Magicarissa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2498429#mania/5494097) (EX1). The 994k run also featured a 14.1:1 rainbow 300 ratio, something that even the top osu!mania 7K players may find difficult to achieve.

---

And that's a wrap for the Quarterfinal recap folks. While its release was untimely, last week's highlights remain very much fresh in our minds! We strongly suggest keeping up with matches as we enter the Finals by staying tuned to the [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) and [osulive_2](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive_2) channels. In the meantime, we'll be looking forward seeing you around for the Semifinals recap!
