title: "Featured Artist Track Updates: Winter 2026"

We're kicking off the year with **70** new songs from artists across our Featured Artist library!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/featured-artist.jpg)

For anyone out of the loop, osu! has an [official music collection](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) where osu! players (such as *you*) can download pre-timed beatmap templates of over **10,000** songs from over **500** artists, with more being added every weekend.

This week's music addition is far from the norm. Instead of adding tracks from a single artist, we're pulling songs **16** different artists into our Featured Artist library! Each of these artists are part of the osu! community already, so you can think of these as expansions to their current listings.

For extra clarity, we've marked every new track with a highly conspicuous **NEW** icon.

## [Culprate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/29)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/29/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/29)

[**Culprate**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/29) might be one of our oldest Featured Artists, but their music is undoubtedly timeless. We picked up two tracks that osu!catch players may be familiar with: *Lightfold* and *Jalaana*, both of which were part of [2025's osu!catch World Cup mappools](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025#mappools)!

If you're up to a challenge, try the maps yourself:

## [EmoCosine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/246)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/246/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/246)

Just like **Culprate**, we expanded [**EmoCosine**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/246)'s listing in part because of [2025's osu!catch World Cup mappools](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025#mappools)! *Ready for Breakdown* was used early in the tournament, and while we were at it, we also snagged *Love Pills* for... reasons. You'll understand when you're older.

## [Good Kid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/240/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240)

[**Good Kid**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240) makes good music. You probably already knew that, and that's why osu! has more of it. Neither of these are Ranked (yet), but they should give you some inspiration for your own maps:

## [Helblinde](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/5/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5)

[**Helblinde**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5) was osu!'s ***fifth*** Featured Artist. That means he's old, but not too old to create awesome music. 

When we received [*Nastrond*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465411) (the song for [2025's osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025)), **Helblinde** requested a couple more songs be added to his listing! Those songs are...

### Helblinde - Mortal Coil

## [hikota](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/463)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/463/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/463)

It's purely coincidental that every artist so far has had only 2 song additions. [**hikota**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/463) is breaking the mold by adding an entire new album to osu!: *Childhood's End*, featuring **8** new songs! Here are a few samples:

### hikota - swamp.wav

## [Kobaryo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/96/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96)

[**Kobaryo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96) takes the gold for having the longest title out of all of today's new songs.

### Kobaryo - HARD-COREMATA (feat. Matatabi Sound System, DJ NECOJITA, Shinonome Interface & blaxervant) (HVS ver.)

## [Kry.exe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/448)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/448/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/448)

[**Kry.exe**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/448)'s track [*Rift Walker*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2412244) won peppy's pick in [Locus 2025](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025). peppy might have liked **Kry.exe**'s music enough to grab a few more tracks too!

[**SiLiS**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/434) joined our Featured Artist library less than a year ago, but between then and now, they've released more music than some artists have in their entire discography! **10** of those tracks are part of osu! as of today. 3 are below, and the rest are on [**SiLiS**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/434)!

This one is for osu!taiko mappers.

Afterwards, **Supire** offered the track to his Featured Artist listing!
