osu! needs more artcore!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/521/header.jpg)

For those unfamiliar with the Japanese doujin scene, "artcore" is a genre focused on the emotional and cinematic side of drum & bass, trance, and other electronic sounds. For those unfamiliar with the circle clicking scene, [*artcore*](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9713839) is also **voira**'s username here on osu!.

**voira** began their music career in 2022, inspired by artists within the drum & bass and artcore scenes like [*ak+q*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/466), *tn-shi*, Sakuzyo*, *AZALI*, and [*xi*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/727). These artists have produced countless songs that have become icons in the rhythm game scene, and as a Featured Artist, **voira** is on the same path.

Bear witness to **10** tracks, all housed as pre-timed beatmap templates on [**voira**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/521)!

Get a glimpse of what's in store, then go to [the listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/521) for the rest:

### voira - break/apart

Before **voira** was a musician, they poured their artistry into osu! mapping. That's why [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2375904) made by **voira** (a.k.a. [artcore](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9713839)) exists!

Next weekend's Featured Artist might be recognisable for the wrong reasons, but we've made it right. You'll know what we mean soon.
