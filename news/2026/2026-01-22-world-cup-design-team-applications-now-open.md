### World Cup Design Team Overview

The World Cup Design Team (WCDT) is a group of volunteer designers responsible for producing the official visual content for five annual [World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments#official-world-cups) tournaments, held in the following chronological order: the osu!mania 7K World Cup, osu!taiko World Cup, osu!catch World Cup, osu!mania 4K World Cup, and osu! World Cup.

The team's work focuses primarily on creating visuals for [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music), along with all other presentation assets released throughout each World Cup, working closely with tournament organisers, music composers, mappool staff, and other tournament contributors.

Designers who join the team may participate in projects across all five World Cups. Each design task is operated on an opt-in basis, with design requirements and deadlines posted in advance. Designers may sign up for projects that match with their interests and availability, and their preferences will be taken into consideration.

### Expectations and responsibilities

Across all roles, the team is looking for designers who are good communicators and are able to work strictly within production timelines. Availability and reliability are important. While the team does not enforce design production, designers are expected to sign up only for projects they are able to commit to and complete work within the agreed timeframe.

Prior experience working on community tournaments is a bonus, but not required. New members will be introduced to the team's workflow, and early projects may involve working alongside more experienced designers to become familiar with the design production process.

It is important to keep in mind that all designs produced must be original work. The use of AI-generated or otherwise plagiarised content is strictly prohibited. Every designer is responsible for ensuring all designs produced are properly credited, and that any copyrighted material is used only with permission or license.

For content standards, please note that osu! is an all-ages game. As such, there are rules about [visual content considerations](/wiki/Rules/Visual_content_considerations) that all visuals must comply with.

Due to the sensitive nature of unreleased content, designers are expected to remain discreet and not share any project materials or information with individuals who do not have access to the project.
