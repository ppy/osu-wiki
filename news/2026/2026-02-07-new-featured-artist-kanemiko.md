If you've been following our World Cups for the last few years, you knew this was coming.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/367/header.jpg)

**kanemiko** made their debut on osu! through [HARDCORE UTOPIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/205), first reaching the osu!catch audience through a beatmap of [*Electrolytes*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1774562). This iconic map led to **kanemiko**'s involvement in the [osu!catch World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2023), producing the [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) [*Cold Fusion*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2011522) for the tournament's mappool.

In the years following, **kanemiko** produced two more original tracks for different World Cups: [*Fractal Vertex*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2253784) for the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K) Grand Finals tiebreaker, and [*Ruin in Cascade*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318032) for the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K) Semifinals tiebreaker. Oh, and we can't forget [this masterpiece](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2234516) produced for [Corsace Open 2024](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/381) and [yet another](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2209401) produced for [TEST Open 2024](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/420)!

With all of that in mind, you were probably counting the days until **kanemiko** joined our Featured Artist catalogue with a full collection of other tracks!

To be specific, there are now **8** new tracks on [**kanemiko**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/367). These are all pre-timed and ready to be mapped at a moment's notice, so you know what to do.

You'll understand the reason everyone maps **kanemiko**'s music once you start mapping it yourself. [**kanemiko**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/367) awaits with plenty of pre-timed `.osz` files to go around.

Next weekend is the Grand Finals showcase for this year's osu!mania 7K World Cup. If you notice our Featured Artist announcement for the weekend is running late, you can guess why.

Stay tuned.
