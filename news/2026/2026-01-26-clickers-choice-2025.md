It's a new year, but we're still looking to reflect and highlight everything awesome about last year. This time, the *players are the focus*, with Clicker's Choice being the community-wide vote to determine who had the most impact.

## The vote

[![**Click here to vote in the Clicker's Choice 2025!**](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-26-clickers-choice-2025/vote.png)](https://choice.hwc.hr/vote/101)

You will only be able to vote for 15 players (and note that you must fill in all of them), but the evaluation will be for the **top 20**.

To get started, you must log in via your osu! account to the voting website. This voting is organised by ::{ flag=DE }:: [hallowatcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1874761), with ::{ flag=GB }:: [SadShiba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10747626) taking over the video production.

## Nominees

The following players will be nominated:

- Players between global rank #1 – #10,000
- Players above 5k play count in 2025

Players who didn't meet these criteria by the start of the voting aren't visible.

## Details

The points that determine the final Clicker's Choice ranking are calculated as follows:

- Your top 15 choices get points according to this distribution: 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1.
- Players of global rank 1–5k get +3 points for every vote
- Players of global rank 5k–15k get +2 points for every vote
- Players of global rank 15k–100k get +1 point for every vote

The voting will close on the **2nd of February @ 00:00 UTC**.
