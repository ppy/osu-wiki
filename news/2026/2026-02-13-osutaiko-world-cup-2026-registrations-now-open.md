The osu!taiko World Cup 2026 is back with a slew of exciting changes!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2026/img/twc2026-banner.jpg)

Taking inspiration from [osu! World Cup 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-09-26-osu-world-cup-2025-registrations-now-open), this year's tournament will feature a Group Stage instead of the traditional Round of 32 format, where the top 8 seeds from the Qualifier stage will receive a bye directly to the Round of 16, bypassing the groups entirely.

## Format changes

Following player feedback and internal discussions, we have decided to return the tournament to the 2v2 format seen in previous editions. We hope this change makes matches more exciting and competitive. Additionally, we are lowering the minimum team size to 2 players — this change is intended to encourage participation from smaller countries that may not have enough players to meet previous requirements.

While we are keeping the overall structure of the Qualifier stage seeding into a double-elimination bracket, there are significant additions to the format we want to highlight. For this year, we are splitting the qualifying teams into two slots:

- **Legends (Qualifier seeds 1–8):** The top 8 teams will advance directly to the Round of 16 winners' bracket, receiving a bye through the Group stage.
- **Challengers (Qualifier seeds 9–32):** The remaining 24 teams will enter a group stage, split into 8 groups of 3 teams each.
  - The 1st-place team from each group will advance to the Round of 16 winners' bracket.
  - The teams at 2nd and 3rd place will be placed in the Round of 16 losers' bracket.

This structure effectively replaces the Round of 32 with a one week Group stage. This offers teams a chance to upset higher-seeded opponents to secure a winners' bracket slot, while ensuring that no teams are eliminated. Even if a team places last in their group, they will still advance to the bracket stage, starting in the losers' bracket.

The group stage will be played in a round-robin format, with each team playing against the other two teams in their group. This guarantees a minimum of 3 matches for every Challenger team (2 Group Stage matches + at least 1 Bracket match), creating a more competitive experience compared to the classic Round of 32 stage where top seeds face off against significantly lower-seeded opponents.

As always, for more details pertaining to the tournament (and the Group stage procedures), refer to the **[osu!taiko World Cup 2026 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2026)**.
