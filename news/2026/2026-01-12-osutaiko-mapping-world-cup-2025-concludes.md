The osu!taiko Mapping World Cup 2025 was the 2nd iteration, following in the footsteps of the already successful [osu!taiko Mapping World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-12-02-osutaiko-mapping-world-cup-2024-concludes) back in 2024.

This country-based, multi-stage osu!taiko mapping contest aims to crown which nation is the best at creating osu!taiko beatmaps.

Find out more about the **osu!taiko Mapping World Cup 2025** on the [wiki page](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2025).

Please give a round of applause to the winners of the osu!taiko Mapping World Cup 2025!

After 3 rounds of shedding blood, sweat, and tears by each member of the **20 participating countries and alliances**, ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan was finally able to secure the first place in the Grand Finals. After a close call last year, they managed to take the lead in 2025 in front of ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland, who won last year's iteration, and newcomer to the podium, ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina. Intense mapping battles ensued throughout the contest. But in the end, Japan's supreme performance was the deciding factor for their victory.

A complete breakdown of the results, including detailed scores and feedback, and a full list of all the participating teams can be found on the [main spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vg0u3erwGcuugFkQv-U7pRUWUaPjuLKfVb_gxJZIinY).

One of the many highlights this year was the collaboration between the **TMWC team** and the **osu!taiko World Cup team**, where the goal for contest participants was to create a difficulty that would be suitable for inclusion in the TWC 2026 Quarterfinals mappool. Two judging teams (a mapping team and a TWC team) were assigned to evaluate the maps. Each team had different judging criteria, but the goal remained the same: to crown the best map!

Thanks to every member of the osu!taiko Mapping World Cup judging team for their efforts and hard work during the contest!
