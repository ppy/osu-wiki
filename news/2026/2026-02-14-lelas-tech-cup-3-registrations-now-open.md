**[Lela’s Tech Cup](linkforumpost)**, or LTC for short, has grown alongside the ever-expanding tech skillsets. With no rank gates and no registrations bound by numbers, osu! players from all corners are free to wander in and let their abilities shine. As the competitive landscape continues to advance; the tournament evolves in parallel, pushing boundaries, rewarding mastery, creativity and showcasing the progression at every level. We invite you to step into this iteration and let Lela’s Tech Cup 3 show you just how deep tech can go.

**[Last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2054146?n=1)**, our poolers challenged themselves to build mappools entirely using unique creators for each selection. It highlights a genuine dedication to diversity and showcasing just how much talent exists in the osu! mapping community. Rather than relying on the same familiar names, the result is a mappool that feels unpredictable, surprising, and more reflective of osu! overall. Players get a fun challenge, mappers get well deserved recognition, and viewers get a more engaging experience. This kind of intentional approach helps tournaments evolve and continues to shape LTC’s identity.

## What's New ?

This LTC iteration expands the scope significantly beyond last year, with a much stronger focus on including a larger number of custom mappers than ever before. Creators representing a wide range of uncommon, style driven approaches will be included, spanning from long established mappers who have been a part of the stylistic variety for years to newer names that have recently gained recognition. 

The Grand Finals tiebreaker, serving as a centerpiece, stands as a symbolic moment, a culmination of ideas from LTC 1, 2, and now 3, merged into a single showcase of growth. We will have the same mappers collaborating; from LTC 1 and 2, who will reunite to bring this finale to life. 

The mappools will be unconventional overall. There will be no strict format to the slots in the pools. We will be bringing back the EX slots. This may entail maps of any modification and/or win conditions. 

As a result of the skillset diversity, the overall difficulty of the maps can be expected to be higher than usual. This allows the tournament to spotlight niche mechanics and advanced techniques that often go unseen, pushing players to adapt and refine rarely tested abilities.

*We have many hidden quests to take part in. What is LTC without a little sparkle?*
