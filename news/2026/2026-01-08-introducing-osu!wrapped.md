Your year in osu!.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/banner.jpg)

Feeling reminiscent? We've got you covered! Introducing osu!wrapped, a brand-new way to revisit all your profile stats of the previous year.

Head over to the new **[osu!wrapped](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped)** page and check out your stats from 2025! There's a breakdown of overall stats, and it also shows your top scores, favourite mappers and beatmaps (i.e. most played), as well as a quick overview of your own beatmapping journey throughout the year.

Click through the tabs at the bottom of the page to navigate between the stat pages. You'll find a share button at the bottom as well, so you can spam your friends and let them know how much you've grown as a player or mapper!

Please note that only the share link, accessed via the share button, is visible to other players. If you copy from the URL bar, the link won't work for others!

## Getting started with osu!wrapped

To help you understand what to expect from osu!wrapped, we've prepared a set of visuals going over its different features.

The first tab, **summary**, is a breakdown of your overall stats from the previous year, as well as a quick summary of your **favourite mappers** and **top plays**.

![summary tab of osu!wrapped](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/wrapped-summary.png)

Next, we have the **top plays** tab, which shows you the top scores you've achieved in the last year. Now, in much more detail as opposed to your player profile!

![top plays tab of osu!wrapped](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/wrapped-topplays.png)

Grinding Daily Challenges during 2025? The **Daily Challenges** tab is here to give you an overview of your cleared challenges, placements, as well as your longest streak.

An overview of your **favourite mappers** can be found in the next tab. In there, you'll find your top 10 mappers of 2025, whose maps you've played the most.

You can take a look at the artists you keep coming back to in the **favourite artists** tab. A nice way to appreciate your favourite musicians throughout the year.

![favourite artists tab of osu!wrapped](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/wrapped-favartists.png)

Last but not least, if you're a beatmapper or modder, the **beatmapping** tab will excite you with a breakdown of your mapping and modding stats from the previous year. We even got a stat for how many beatmaps you've nominated!

![beatmapping tab of osu!wrapped](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/wrapped-beatmapping.png)

If you don't see the **Daily Challenges** or the **beatmapping** tab, then you haven't played Daily Challenges or haven't mapped or modded anything in 2025. But who knows? Maybe you'll be inspired to try in 2026!

Check out the osu!wrapped recaps here from [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped/5773079?share=9c956c5228131e241b1cdf961f9ffa8b), [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped/9501251?share=59fa044960d4d860996067197e9bbf8a), and [Yasuho](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped/8458835?share=303244a081eb179d5515dbe57d36f651) as a few examples.

While the current osu!wrapped page may be rough around the edges, we're looking to add more features, statistics and polish in the future.

Make sure to also use the hashtag `#osuwrapped25` for when you share your osu!wrapped on X/Twitter!

We wanted to also take the chance to reflect on other areas of the game. Read on for stats and reflections around [mapping & modding](#mapping-&-modding), [tournaments](#tournaments), [World Cups](#world-cups), [the osu! music scene](#bespoke-music), [Featured Artist additions](#featured-artists), [osu!(lazer)](#osu!(lazer)), and [IRL events](#irl-events) during 2025. We have prepared a (somewhat) short and sweet run-through of all the things that happened around the community, in case you wanted to catch up or reminisce before starting your new osu! year.

## Mapping & Modding

The mapping scene has boomed during 2025, to a point where words alone cannot convey it. As such, we've decided to put it into numbers! Here are some of the most interesting statistics we've gathered so far:

- **27,496 difficulties ranked across 6,772 beatmap sets.** If our math is correct, around half of which are Sidetracked Day and Harumachi Clover covers.
  - **105 of these ranked sets were originally uploaded before 2018.** Talk about mappers having love for their old creations!
- **272,117 total difficulties uploaded across 133,555 beatmap sets.** We cannot begin to imagine how many more maps would be uploaded, were the Pending limits not exist...
- **1,145 difficulties loved across 324 beatmap sets.**
- **1,467,534 beatmap discussion posts sent.** Modders have been working overtime just for a couple of scraps and extra kudosu.

All in all, the mapping scene has been more alive than ever before. After all it is the living blood of the game, offering players a wide variety of songs (and challenges!) to enjoy throughout the year.

Another standout this year has been the sheer amount of beatmapping contests held by the community. Some of which include [Pending Cup 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-24-pending-cup-2025), [Newspaper Cup 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-29-newspaper-cup-2025), and how could we forget about the return of the [osu! Beatmapping World Championship](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-04-07-osu-beatmapping-world-championship-2025). Suffice to say, osu! mappers have been eating good this year!

Not to stay behind from the rise of community-made contests, the osu! team worked hard to bring one of the most novel and popular mapping contests up to date. Almost a year ago on the clock, [Locus](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-31-locus) was first announced. By merging visual, sound, and mapping creativity all into one, Locus managed to produce some of the unique and interesting mapping experiences we've seen coming out of a contest so far! We strongly suggest checking its [results](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-08-21-locus-2025-results) to judge for yourself.

Finally, [Mappers' Guild](https://mappersguild.com/) continued being an amazing entry point for new mappers via their priority quests, as well as a good source of points and goodies for those mappers undertaking normal quests and ranking their favourite Featured Artists' tracks. During 2025, a staggering amount of **X normal quests** and **Y priority quests** were completed, with over **Z Featured Artist beatmaps** submitted during that same time.

## Tournaments

Just like in previous years, the tournament scene remained vibrant in 2025. With a whopping **255 supported tournaments** happening this year across all modes, there was plenty of competition for everyone.

This year unfortunately saw the **GTS tournament series** come to an end. After 7 long years of tournaments — mainly for the osu!taiko game mode — we saw one last epic year of tournaments and contests to wrap things up. The pinnacle of this year being undoubtedly the [EGTS 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes) tournament, seeing more than 150 drum masters drumming it out on some of the hardest and most gruelling mappools we have seen in the osu!taiko scene.

The piano side of tournaments saw players glued to their keyboards holding on for dear life. From as little as 1 key, to the ever-mesmerising 7 keys (and beyond), it was all-hands-on-deck for players to edge out their opponents. And with players getting more and more skilled in both rice and noodles — also known as long notes — it is only natural to be hungry for more. This year saw the return of the [osu!mania Long Note tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-12-09-osumania-ln-tournament-4-concludes) after a hiatus of 3 years, with more fierce competition than ever. Will 2026 see us firing up the wok once more?

And last but certainly not least, of those 255 a massive **192 tournaments** were for the osu! game mode! 2025 saw new champions being crowned and rivalries fought out. Of course we cannot mention osu! tournaments without also mentioning [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961). One of this year's osu! Champions, they emerged victorious in an incredible 15 badged tournaments, earning them more than a dozen new decorations to add to their already mighty impressive profile. This year can also be considered the year where LAN tournaments have made a breakthrough in production and design, with [The Roundtable Open](https://theroundtable.gg/trtopen2025) back in April showing us what LAN tournaments can be.

## World Cups

And as always in the competitive scene, we have the **World Cups**! In osu!mania, ::{ flag=US }:: United States and ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea succesfully defended their thrones in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-concludes) and the [osu!mania 7K World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-03-03-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes) respectively. ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan emerged victorious once more in the [osu!taiko World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-04-osutaiko-world-cup-concludes) — that's their 12th victory in a row! And in the [osu!catch World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-07-29-osucatch-world-cup-2025-concludes) we saw ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina winning their first ever World Cup!

As always though, we end the year with the highly anticipated [osu! World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-12-28-osu-world-cup-2025-concludes). With more teams than ever competing for glory, and group stages making a triumphant return, we dare say that the **osu! World Cup 2025** was one of the absolute highlights of the year. At the end of all the blood, sweat, and tears, we saw ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland securing the win in bracket reset. Congratulations to all of our osu! champions! Now it's time to see who comes out on top in 2026.

## Bespoke music

This year has been a blessing for the osu! [bespoke music](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) repertoire! In 2025 alone, **54 osu! original songs** were featured throughout the World Cup series of tournaments. While it may not seem like much when compared to 2024's output with 58 original tracks, being able to keep up the cadence of releases by bolstering our ever-expanding [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) of licensed tracks has been a great achievement. We can only hope to keep up with the pace during 2026, much to the delight of the community!

Speaking of original tracks, 2025 has had the most community original songs ever featured in the platform. With the introduction of the [osu! community music](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/462) in the Featured Artist listing, a total of **131 community originals** were featured during the year. This wouldn't have been possible without the combined efforts of our community, both throughout contest, tournament, and mapping spheres alike!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/bespoke-music-in-2025.png)

## Featured Artists

Last but definitely not least, this year has seen the arrival of **64 brand-new Featured Artists** — a full stack! With that also came the addition of **1206 new licensed tracks**. Only time can tell what surprises await ahead of us in 2026. For the time being, however, let us enjoy all the songs we've been able to enjoy throughout 2025, of which there have been more than plenty.

## osu!(lazer)

osu!(lazer)'s development has been on full throttle this year. With more and more features — both new and returning ones — being added, players have flocked to the new and improved client.

2025 saw one of the biggest increases in active users and score submissions to date, in no small part thanks to the addition of [Quick Play](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-12-05-introducing-quick-play) and the website's brand-new [download page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download). While both changes may seem small, those two alone **almost doubled** the number of active users and score submissions in the span of a couple months!

## IRL events

We had a number of offline events this year. Here's what you were up to:

In February, [Polish players gathered at the KEL LAN event](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-04-29-kel-lan-tournament-3-recap), with a hectic tournament bracket where rounds had all matches playing simultaneously.

In July, [Chinese osu! players competed at China LAN 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-30-china-lan-2025), with ::{ flag=HK }:: [mcy4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2165650) won the tournament against ::{ flag=CN }:: [lolol235](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6090175) in the Finals. You can check out the [VODS on bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/3546939226327250)!

![osu! players at China LAN 2025](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/china-lan-2025-venue.jpg)

They took group photos for both event days, so to include everyone, here's both:

A little later in July, [over 450 osu! players visited the Moscow osu! Event](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-08-moscow-osu-event-2025-recap), complete with a cosplay event and booths for various other rhythm games too.

![Taiko no Tatsujin booth at MOE2025](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-08-moscow-osu-event-2025-recap/gamezone-taiko.jpg)

![Megacollab picture of MOE2025 attendees](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-08-moscow-osu-event-2025-recap/megacollab.jpg)

At the end of July and into the start of August, another large number of people went to cavoe's osu! event in the Netherlands. There were tournaments, rhythm game booths, side events and everything in between. ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), the #1 ranked player in the game, flew in and [won the tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDR2AsTFCDw).

::{ flag=US }:: [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/3171691) made an excellent [video covering COE 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmDG_dzi_JQ), go check it out! Also, the event was apparently even [covered on Dutch television](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/1mdg92h/coe_in_dutch_news/).

![Overhead drone group picture at COE 2025](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/coe-2025-group-picture.jpg)

At the end of October and a bit into November, [British players went to EPIC46 in the UK](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-11-22-osu-uk-epic46-recap), and you probably would never believe that pro osu! tournament player ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) won the bracket.

![osu! group picture](/wiki/shared/news/2025-11-22-osu-uk-epic46-recap/group-picture.jpg)

In December, [Malaysian osu! players gathered at Comic Fiesta 2025](https://twitter.com/osumalaysia/status/2003411903444582447).

![Group picture of Malaysian players at Comic Fiesta 2025](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-08-introducing-osu!wrapped/cf-2025-group-picture.jpg)

...and there were many more meetups and LAN events of course, but we'd be here all day covering them. We've observed a recurring talking point in recent years about osu!'s local tournament scene growing, and although we haven't done any comprehensive analysis, we're inclined to believe that it's a real trend.

See you again sometime in 2026!
