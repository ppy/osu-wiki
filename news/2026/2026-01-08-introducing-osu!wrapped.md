Feel like recapping your last year in osu!? We've got you covered! Introducing osu!wrapped, a brand new way to revisit all your profile stats in one place.
Head over to the new **[osu!wrapped](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped)** page and check out your stats from the previous year! You are able to see an overall breakdown of your stats, as well as your top scores, favorite mappers and beatmaps, and even an overview of your own beatmapping journey throughout the year.

Click through the tabs at the bottom of the page and remind yourself of all the accomplishments you've earned in 2025! Share your osu!wrapped with all your friends and let them know how much you've grown as a player or beatmapper! You can also share your stats with the community by clicking the **Share** button in the bottom right. Please note, that a user's osu!wrapped is only accessible after said user has shared their link with you.

## Getting started with osu!wrapped

To give you a small rundown of what you can expect from osu!wrapped, we prepared some visuals to help you get a better understanding of the page.
Be advised, that the osu!wrapped page is a work in progress, and we're looking to add more features and statistics to it for the year to come.

The first tab, **Summary**, is a breakdown of your overall stats from the previous year. As well as a quick sumamry of your **favorite mappers** and **top plays**.

Next, we have the **Top Plays** tab, which shows you the top scores you've achieved in the last year. Now, in further detail.

Last but not least, if you're a beatmapper or modder, the **Beatmapping** tab will excite you with a breakdown of your mapping and modding stats from the previous year. Did you nominate beatmaps in 2025? We even got a stat for how many beatmaps you've nominated!

Please also note, that you might not see the **Daily Challenges** or the **Beatmapping** tab. This is because you haven't played daily challenges or haven't mapped or modded something in 2025. But who knows? Maybe you'll find the spirit throughout 2026!

Check out the osu!wrapped recaps here from [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped/5773079?share=9c956c5228131e241b1cdf961f9ffa8b), [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped/9501251?share=59fa044960d4d860996067197e9bbf8a) and [Yasuho](https://osu.ppy.sh/wrapped/8458835?share=303244a081eb179d5515dbe57d36f651) as a few examples.

We wanted to also take the chance, to reflect on other areas of the game. Please read on, to find out what has happened in **[tournaments](#tournaments)**, **[world cups](#world-cups)**, **[bespoke music](#bespoke-music)**, and **[featured artists](#featured-artists)** during 2025. We have prepared a sweet runthrough of all the things you might have missed out on or to simply enjoy one more time before you start into your new osu! year.

## Tournaments

Just like in previous years, the tournament scene remains vibrant in 2025. With **a whopping 255 supported tournaments** happening this year, there was plenty of competition for everyone.

This year unfortunately saw the **GTS tournament series** come to an end. After a whopping 7 years of tournaments — mainly for the osu!taiko game mode — we saw one last epic year of tournaments and contests to wrap things up. The pinnacle of this year being undoubtedly the [EGTS 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes) tournament, seeing more than 150 drum masters drumming it out on some of the hardest and most grueling mappools we have seen in the osu!taiko scene.

The piano side of tournaments saw players glued to their keyboards holding on for dear life. From as little as 1-key, to the ever mesmerising 7-keys, it was all hands on deck for players to edge out their opponents. And with players getting more and more skilled in both rice and noodles — we call long notes that — it is only natural to be hungry for more. This year saw the return of the [osu!mania Long Note tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-12-09-osumania-ln-tournament-4-concludes) after a hiatus of 3 years, with more fierce competition than ever. Will 2026 see us firing up the wok once more?

And last but certainly not least, of those 255 tournaments, **a massive 192 were for the osu! game mode**! 2025 saw new champions being crowned and rivalries fought out. Of course we cannot mention osu! tournaments without also mentioning [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961). One of this year's osu! Champions, they emerged victorious in an incredible 15 supported tournaments, earning them more than a dozen new badges to add to their already mighty impressive profile. This year can also be considered the year where LAN tournaments have made a breakthrough in production and design. With [The Roundtable Open](https://theroundtable.gg/trtopen2025) back in April showing us what LAN tournaments can be.

## World Cups

And as always in the competitive scene, we have the **World Cups**! In osu!mania, ::{ flag=US }:: United States and ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea succesfully defended their thrones in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-concludes) and the [osu!mania 7K World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-03-03-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes) respectively. ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan emerged victorious once more in the [osu!taiko World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-04-osutaiko-world-cup-concludes) — that's their 12th victory in a row! — and in the [osu!catch World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-07-29-osucatch-world-cup-2025-concludes) we saw ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina winning their first ever World Cup!

As always though, we end the year with the highly-anticipated [osu! World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-12-28-osu-world-cup-2025-concludes). With more teams than ever competing for glory, and group stages making a triumphant return, we dare say that the **osu! World Cup 2025** was one of the absolute highlights of the year. At the end of all the blood, sweat and tears, we saw ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland securing the win in bracket reset. Congratulations to all of our osu! champions this year! Now it's time to see who comes out on top in 2026.

## Bespoke music

This year has been a blessing for the osu! [bespoke music](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) repertoire! In 2025 alone, **54 osu! original songs** were featured throughout the World Cup series of tournaments. While it may not seem like much when compared to 2024's output with 58 original tracks, being able to keep up the cadence of releases by bolstering our ever-expanding [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) of licensed tracks has been a great achievement. We can only hope to keep up with the pace during 2026, much to the delight of the community!

Speaking of original tracks, 2025 has had the most community original songs ever featured in the platform. With the introduction of the [osu! community music](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/462) in the Featured Artist listing, a total of **131 community originals** were featured during the year. This wouldn't have been possible without the combined efforts of our community, both throughout contest, tournament, and mapping spheres alike!

## Featured Artists

Last but definitely not least, this year has seen the arrival of **64 brand new Featured Artist** — a full stack! With that also came the addition of **1206 new licensed tracks**. Only time can tell what surprises await ahead of us in 2026. For the time being, however, let us enjoy all the songs we've been able to enjoy throughout 2025, of which there have been more than plenty.
