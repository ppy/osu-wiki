With a happy new year, there is a happy new season of Beatmap Spotlights! Catch up on the latest news and check out a brand-new selection of beatmaps for you to compete on.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/beatmap-spotlights-new.jpg)

The **Beatmap Spotlights Curators** went above and beyond again to put together a fantastic range of the most popular and highly anticipated beatmaps of the season. Get ready to compete for the highest placement in the seasonal rankings and dance away the cold winter days in the newly opened Beatmap Spotlights arena!

### Changes

We want to introduce changes to the playlist score multipliers this season.

#### Playlist score multipliers

In the previous seasons, best scores of each playlist for each user ordered from highest to lowest would get multiplied by 1, 0.75, and 0.5 respectively, summing into seasonal total score. After careful consideration and listening to the feedback from the community, we have decided to tweak the multipliers to **1/0.9/0.8** starting this season. This will give you more of an incentive to play all three playlists and also reward players with the widest skill sets.

## How do I participate in the Beatmap Spotlights League? {id=how-to-participate}

To be able to participate in the Beatmap Spotlights playlists, grab yourself the latest version of the [osu!(lazer) client](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download).

Once you're done installing and logging into your account, head over to the `playlists` tab in the `play` section and find the Beatmap Spotlight lobbies, denoted by a little green `Spotlights` indicator. You can also toggle the filter to show only Beatmap Spotlight playlists in the top-right corner.

Changing game modes is as simple as clicking one of the four mode icons at the top left of your screen — it'll be whatever game mode you played last on osu!(lazer) by default.

Once you have submitted a play on any of the beatmaps featured in the playlist, you will be able to check your placement in the seasonal rankings, as well as enjoy your shiny assigned division badge at the top of your user profile.

Check out the respective game mode seasonal rankings:

*primarily suggested and described by [Boolin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10664409)*

We're kicking off this season in style with [Lince Cosmico's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6070370) map of [Angelic layer (Kurubukko Remix) by SHIKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2301567#osu/4918832)!

Lince Cosmico's clean aesthetics and masterful playfield usage, combined with impeccable hitsounds by [TtmnZk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2495509) and a gorgeous [tochiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366) storyboard, form an absolute spectacle of a map. Their contributions complement each other perfectly, fully immersing players in an unforgettable journey through the stars. It's a one-of-a-kind experience and a labour of love from start to finish.

#### Beatmap of the Season - Curators' Pick

**[Slax - Body to the Drum \[Taiko to the Beat\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343891#taiko/5038601)**, created by [Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574) and [ler1211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19901680)\
*primarily suggested and described by [nevqr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14269506)*

Over the past few years, [Slax](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/465) has practically become a household name in the osu!taiko community, and when he was tasked with making an osu! original for the [osu!taiko World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025), he definitely delivered.

[Body to the Drum](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343891#taiko/5038601) is made by none other than [ler1211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19901680). If you're familiar with traditional taiko tournament slots, NM1 is the name of the game. Prepare yourself for an absolute bundle of consistency, offbeat doublets, even-numbered patterns that will keep you on your toes (or fingers, in this case!), and, last but not least, streams coming right at you at 230 BPM! All while listening to an absolute banger of a track.

So what's the hold-up? Go try out the map and move your body to the drum to keep yourself warm during this chilly winter season!

*described by [SadEgg](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10278243)*

Polyphia's "Ego Death" presents precise, powerful polyrhythmic patterns produced purely punishing, persistent patterns; providing pure pain. AnApple provides a polished, playful, and pleasing perspective.

Sorry, the letter P had gotten stuck there, BUT what was said is pretty much true. Out of the few maps that pass through our radar, there are ones that show clear signs of uniqueness that are hard to implement easily or correctly (or at all). AnApple went a step further and has brought control movement theory into a whole new category, which came not just as a surprise, but a welcome one at that.

#### Beatmap of the Season - Curators' Pick

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-01-16-beatmap-spotlights-winter-2026/2129944.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2129944#mania/4478878)

**[Dustvoxx, Loctek - Labyrinth of Mind \[\[7K\] Diffusion\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2129944#mania/4478878)**, created by [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904)\
*primarily suggested and described by [Seulgi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4918394)*

The beatmap selected for this season's Curators' Pick was created through the collaboration of composers [Dustvoxx and Loctek](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/386), whose music sets listeners' hearts racing, and mapper [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904), known for crafting fantastic charts built upon top-level playability.

Above all, this chart challenges players with an unending flow of rice patterns over the course of five minutes, demanding extreme finger independence, technical proficiency, and stamina. Chaotic music and immersive patterning persist throughout the entire chart, where you get to feel an intense buildup of notes that is maintained from the first kiai all the way to the very end.

This chart was included in the mappool for the [osu!mania 7K Chinese National Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MCNC/7K2024) Finals. While it was not played on match day, its inclusion in a Finals-level mappool speaks for the chart's quality.

With its demanding structure and sustained intensity, this chart stands as a fitting representation of the season. Players looking for a true test of control and endurance will find a deeply rewarding experience from start to finish, and we are pleased to present it as this season's Beatmap of the Season.
