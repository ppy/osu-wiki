The conclusion is just right around the corner! Get to know the teams that'll face each other in the Grand Finals after reading this week's recap.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-26-osumania-7k-world-cup-2026-finals-recap/banner.jpg)

The final weeks of a tournament oftentimes become the most exciting parts of the entire event. Let it be the stakes, the difficulty of the pools, the fact players are expected to outperform themselves, or a combination of all of these. We've already seen how all of these aforementioned factors have made this year's osu!mania 7K World Cup one of the most exciting yet — if not the most. However, the finale will make them exponentially more noticeable!

While active viewers of the tournament may have already been spoiled by last week's Grand Finals matches, we'd like to reminisce the best moments leading up to the last matches. Bear with us as we take a look back at the Finals: the round that would determine which teams will meet at the final bout.

And with another written recap, we have another video recap by the hands of our trusty team. Keep a heads-up for both this and next week's videos as [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), [epic man 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000), [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895), and [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622)'s series of posts are soon to come to an end!

With the number of teams taking part in the lattermost rounds dropping drastically, the [weekly stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1snjf2r4GJpqP9AI8ciR86wywtnFOZ1Kq_uOkrZdIgEc/view?rm=minimal&gid=1128644099#gid=1128644099) are not to be trusted too much when it comes to finding standouts in these final pools. That isn't to say there haven't been any maps worth highlighting!

For starters, we saw yet another increase in the pool's size and the introduction of best-of-13 rounds. This would be the last increase in match length we would see in the tournament, but it most likely has been the most impactful. Both [Akiri - Beyond Wood (Full Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505190#mania/5515606) (RC7) by ::{ flag=US }:: [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092) and [Kano - Daisy Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505157#mania/5515505) (LN5) by ::{ flag=CN }:: [_Yiiiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6066359) acted as their respective slots' consistency picks. The consistency category is not known to be easy in a tournament setting. As the name implies, consistency is the name of the game, which is somewhat of a tall task when faced with a nonstop, marathoning stream of rice and noodles as far as the eye can see.

Another remarkable chart we had amongst the normal pool was [Isekaijoucho - Isekai no Housekitai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505219#mania/5515670) (LN1) by ::{ flag=CN }:: [U1d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10125072). A fairly contested pick with its fair share of protects, bans, and most impressively, picks. It is fairly uncommon to see the LN coordination slot being used this much, particularly with such rice-loaded teams, but perhaps that was the goal all along by throwing a curveball to their rivals and themselves along the way!

But what truly shone was this round's [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) as seen by the hype surrounding its showcase, its 100% pick rate and the amazing moments it left for us in last week's matches. As such, we'd like to present you...

As the introduction rightfully pointed out, [Spark of Mayhem](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505214#mania/5515662) was a sight to behold. Once the team saw [Kobaryo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96)'s most recent collaboration with osu!, we knew it was going to be a map loved by both players and spectators alike. And alas, our predictions couldn't have been further from the truth! With the help of [ExNeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7590894) and the amazing assets provided by the [World Cup Design Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams/2764), we could not be any happier with the result.

## Finals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| China ::{ flag=CN }:: | 6 | **7** | ::{ flag=JP }:: **Japan** |
| **Indonesia** ::{ flag=ID }:: | **7** | 3 | ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **7** | 1 | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines |
| **Japan** ::{ flag=JP }:: | **7** | 1 | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia |

There's no better way to summarise this last batch of matches prior to the Grand Finals than with the idiom "quality over quantity". There were fewer matches than in the earlier rounds, for sure, but they were not any less impressive because of that. The podium was literally on the line, so failure was not an option for any of the teams.

We welcome all of you to take the time and review the [VODs](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2026_7K#finals) if you have not already. We can assure that all the matches were worth the watch! If you're only looking for the meatiest highlight of the Finals on the other hand, don't worry. We've got you covered.

The Grand Finals are right around the corner, and teams are not pulling any punches! One prime case example would be arguably the tightest match of the round: China (#3) versus Japan (#5). Both teams are well known for consistently having reached the Finals in several previous World Cups, and as per usual, they wouldn't give up any chance for a spot in this year's grand finale!

Japan secured the first pick and immediately chose [Akiri - Beyond Wood (Full Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505190#mania/5515606) (RC7), a very strong start for such a rice-dominant team. Despite ending up with a win, China fought very hard as proven by the relatively small 15,318-point lead. Both ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) are to be praised, however, with their 985,608 and 985,284 full combos respectively. Bonus points for the Japanese player for getting the highest ratio in the lobby!

From this point onwards, China and Japan continued trading blows, with China focusing on long note picks whereas Japan dominated the rice category. The tables were turned when China picked [Kano - Daisy Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505157#mania/5515505) (LN5). Despite the score fluctuations throughout the map, Japan managed to get a rather narrow 4,770-point lead and subsequently winning the first break point of the match. This lead was only extended by using the ace under their sleeves, [KOTOKO - Re-sublimity (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505183#mania/5515575) (RC4). As was expected of the chordjack pick, this was a fairly easy win for Japan, pushing the scoreline to 5–2 in their favour, yet China's unwillingness to give up is still worth mentioning, as shown by ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904)'s amazing 995,461 score.

Even though China secured another point right afterward, Japan wasn't letting their lead slip away and brought the score up to 6–3. That said, Japan was running out of rice picks, and they would need to start relying on more risky maps to secure their match point. As such, when their bet on the last rice pick backfired, with China winning by a very commanding 33,097-point lead, all bets were off. This eventually led to a 6–6 tie when China clutched on [Camellia - GHOST GIRL CANNOT BE KILLED](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505209#mania/5515656) (HB3) by a minuscule 4,408 margin, forcing the tiebreaker.

The tiebreaker started quite intensely, with both teams keeping the score close early on. As the song progressed, however, the gap widened noticeably as China appeared to struggle with the map's raw physical demands. Despite their attempts to recover, Japan ultimately seized control over the map and secured the victory with a commendable 51,210-point win, ending the entire match and maintaining their spot in the osu!mania 7K World Cup!

Congratulations to Japan for their impressive performance, showing a significant improvement from last year! Likewise, China demonstrated why they're amongst the best 7K teams in the world as they once again reached the Finals even in the face of defeat. We look forward to seeing them return even stronger in the future!

## Score highlights

The latter rounds are a true testament to the players' skills as the pools peak in difficulty. Normal humans such as us would not be able to keep up with these maps, let alone overperform on them. Here are a handful of scores we deemed the most appropriate to give a shout:

- ::{ flag=KR }:: [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406)'s 995k run on [Ice Plumes - Kairou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505149#mania/5515483) (RC2) is basically the peak of bracket chordstream performance. They were able to maintain a really tight 10.5:1 rainbow 300 ratio while only getting one 200 in the process! Just a note away from perfection.
- ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) made a case for "China's best rice player" by achieving the only 970k+ score on [Kyokushi - <3 x <3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505103#mania/5515361) (RC6). A score that will forever be close to our hearts.
- [Isekaijoucho - Isekai no Housekitai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505219#mania/5515670) (LN1) gave us two 977k performances from::{ flag=KR }:: [HanJaeHun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2402586) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904). These two plays alone made a map colloquially known as "timing hell" appear to be "timing heaven" with how easily they dominated it!
- Team PH's [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405) flexed their hybrid muscles by getting a weekend-topping 988k score on [MetaHumanBoi - ILLUSTRIOUS DRIFTERS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2505201#mania/5515631) (HB1). Goodness knows how well they'll perform next year!
