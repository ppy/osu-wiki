[In case you're new here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2026-02-04-community-choice-2025), the *Community Choice* polls are a yearly event where players and mappers set their differences aside and unite on celebrating the best beatmaps of the year.

With each iteration, a handsome set of rewards is bestowed upon the winners, namely a 6-month osu!supporter tag (3 months for osu!mania 7K) split among everyone involved in the winning map, alongside a bespoke profile badge to commemorate their achievement. The rest of the top 10 (top 5 for osu!mania 7K) for each *Community Choice* category will also be receiving a 1-month osu!supporter tag each.

Counting a total of **69,421** votes from **8,963** users across all game modes, *you* certainly made your favourites known, and it's time to reveal the results!

Here's a highlight reel of all the winning beatmaps if you're more of a visual learner:

Many would argue that 2025 has been the year of aim maps and high pp numbers, and [**Arash - Temptation (feat. Rebecca) (Nightcore Mix)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2235601) is definitely a testament to that.

[**-Arko**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8802914)'s rendition of [this Aphex Twin banger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2445466) has captured the hearts of many of our mappers. It's not every day you get to see difficult and experimental, yet very meaningful patterning where each and every circle feels like it has a purpose. Not to mention the incredible hitsounding work that perfectly complements and even enhances the song's atmosphere.

It's no secret that osu!taiko tends to shine with its tournament bangers, and [**TWC Sound Team "Strike Back Squad" - BUZZ CUTZ**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2358247) is no exception. The osu!taiko World Cup 2025 delivered a fully custom Grand Finals tiebreaker mapped by mapping legends [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650), [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719), [nananass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7231722), [Nurend](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9905079) and [layxa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14800030) paired with a storyboard by [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762), [Kuroise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127), [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436) and [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323). The map took a semi-niche genre — dariacore — and pushed it to new heights with a 9-minute experience that had players and mappers alike on the edge of their seats.

Similar to its sister beatmaps from other modes, [**skill issue lol**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12498861)'s rendition of [**Iyowa feat. Adachi Rei - Heat abnormal**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2341650) took on a *very* distinct and experimental take on the song, one that challenged both reading and gameplay through unconventional patterning. Much like its counterparts, it resonated deeply with players and earned enough acclaim to secure the Community Choice award.

[**Phob**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462) takes on a very distinct take on [**Billain - Specialist**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2032278), a custom tiebreaker tailored for the [3CWC 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1774416?n=1) Finals tiebreaker. This one incorporates wild sliders and convert-type patterns (in the best of ways) to squeeze absolutely everything out of an already awesome groove. It holds no punches in both the quality and difficulty department, so don't let the star rating fool you!

If you've been in the community for a modest amount of time, [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092) should not come up as a new name for you. Better known as "ET Blocko", their [**TWC Sound Team "Strike Back Squad" - BUZZ CUT**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2367508#mania/5154426) instantly drew the attention of the community despite being ranked in the nick of time — a mere 3 days away from the New Year 2026!

This was further complemented by the guest contributions from [Akasha-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) and [Mochineko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196), as well as [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762)'s storyboard which was initially featured in the [osu!taiko World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025). No wonder it ended up winning in both categories.

### Community Choice

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-24-community-choice-2025-results/mania-xk.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2299422)

6K players have eaten good this year. Both Community Choice and Mapper's Favourite beatmaps for the xK category ended up landing on the same key mode! [Rio1-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5604329)'s [**Hiiragi Magnetite - Tetoris**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2299422#mania/4913196) won this year's Community Choice with their more approachable entry-level 6k spread, a very good choice for those looking for an onboarding experience to the less common key modes!

### Mapper's Favourite

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-24-community-choice-2025-results/mania-xk-mapper-1.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2286223)

[BKwind](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8900975)'s contributions to the 6K scene are far from few. With 5 maps ranked during 2025, [**Lime - Campanella**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2286223#mania/4876997), which coincidentally was uploaded on the very first day of the year, ended up catching most mappers' attention, winning this year's Mapper's Favourite pick. With difficulties all over the spectrum — and beyond! — there is bound to be a difficulty just for you.

osu! is known for its wide breadth of songs, maps and even key modes in osu!mania. As the saying goes, the more the merrier, which makes it fitting that mappers picking their favourite maps ended up in a tie! The second crown goes to [**Laur - Swift Swing**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2088446#mania/4376573) by [U1d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10125072), which offers a rather unique jazz experience for players with 6 fingers to spare. With the inclusion of a couple in-between difficulties by the hand of [Telzzxs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10210497) and [VividCycle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14351534), the spread ended up being accessible to a wide range of players.
