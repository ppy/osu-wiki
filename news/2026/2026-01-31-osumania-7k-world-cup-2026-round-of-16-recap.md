The show goes on! The second round in the bracket stage of the osu!mania 7K World Cup concluded last week. While it didn't have the most fanfare, we still had plenty of exciting matches to enjoy. Notably, we also had our first eliminations this round.

While last week's pool could still be considered to be early game, the small bump in difficulty has definitely been noticed by some of the teams — in some slots more than others. Long note picks such as [Dionela - Marilag](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495166#mania/5484301) by ::{ flag=PH }:: [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936) or [Mili - world.execute(me);](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495253#mania/5484508) by ::{ flag=RU }:: [Kurisu Makise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2790640) with the help of ::{ flag=CN }:: [_Yiiiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6066359) were the most unforgiving to players, taking up slots LN1 and EX2 respectively.

Luckily for our players, most rice picks remained at a manageable level, so much so that last week's most popular pick of the pool ended up being [69 de 74 - RTTR](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2496728#mania/5488848) by ::{ flag=CN }:: [Carpihat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10085090), taking up the RC3 category. This should not be a surprise given that most teams found the map's simpler layout much more comfortable to play, even when accounting for its increased pattern variety as opposed to its Round of 32 sibling.

Special mention goes to [EmoCosine - Love Pills](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495158#mania/5484254) by ::{ flag=JP }:: [\[GS\]Hina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20040607) (EX1) and [Kagetora. - Time to beat the odds (extended ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495274#mania/5484549) by ::{ flag=VN }:: [Akasha-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596306) (TB) which are soon to be Ranked (or already are, depending on when you read this). Go give them a shot, and see how well you fare compared to the tournament's top players!

We may not have had as many tiebreakers as last week — we had none, in fact. That doesn't mean we didn't have any close matches, however. Thailand and Vietnam had to fight tooth and nail to stay atop their rivals, those being Hong Kong and the United Kingdom respectively.

Suffice to say, while we may not have had any major upsets, those two matches stood out from the rest. As such, we would like to highlight what we believe to be the best out of the two!

### ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom vs. ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam

When we saw last week's match between the United Kingdom (#27) and Vietnam (#22), we already knew we would be highlighting it on the very first chance we got. With both teams' spots in the tournament on the line, this was the perfect setup for an intense and heated match! This was only made clearer by the fact that both sides displayed a similar level of skill, making it impossible to predict the outcome from the start!

As the match began, Vietnam was able to win the very first two picks right away for a break point, prompting the United Kingdom to immediately respond with their protected pick, [AAAA – reach for your victory!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495149#mania/5484225) (RC1). Vietnam started strong with a score lead which only continued to grow, putting the United Kingdom between a rock and a hard place. The momentum shifted drastically during the final section of the map, however. An unfortunate chain of misses from Vietnam allowed the United Kingdom to close the gap substantially, letting them make an impressive comeback and claim their first win of the match with a lead of 18,647 points! A score worth noting here is ::{ flag=GB }:: [WandrYondr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25750653)'s impressive 982,476-point full combo.

The United Kingdom used this chance to take the lead into the next match, securing yet another win and bringing the scoreboard back to a 2–2 tie. Unfazed by the tide shift, Vietnam answered back with their protected pick, [Mili - world.execute(me);](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495253#mania/5484508) (EX2). This led to a fierce battle between both teams, trading blows all throughout the match. The score kept fluctuating, and neither side was willing to give in! After an incredibly close skirmish, Vietnam emerged victorious with a razor-thin **2,400-point lead**, highlighting just how close the match truly was.

This was followed with another quick win for Vietnam, pushing the scoreboard to 4–2 in their favour and reaching match point. On the precipice of the abyss, the United Kingdom picked [69 de 74 – RTTR](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2496728#mania/5488848) (RC3) to try and capitalise on their consistency. The strategy paid off as the United Kingdom secured their third win and reignited hopes for a tiebreaker! Determined to avoid this scenario, Vietnam carefully considered the remaining picks in the mappool before selecting [NIWASHI – Sapphire On Fire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495159#mania/5484255) (HB3). Ultimately, the match point ended up landing on Vietnam's well-deserving hands after a hard-fought battle with the Brits.

Congratulations to Vietnam on advancing to the next round! It was an incredibly close battle, with both teams showcasing their sheer skill and determination, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats all throughout the entire match. A big round of applause as well to the United Kingdom for their strong performance, and we look forward for their return next year!

## Score highlights

The intensity kept climbing as we moved into the Round of 16. With the bracket tightening and the stakes higher than ever, a lot of teams were trying to make a case for their continued campaign. We think that the following scores are worth the highlight for this round:

- Filipino legend, ::{ flag=PH }:: [bojii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083439), *reached victory* by dropping the weekend's best score on [AAAA – reach for your victory!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495149#mania/5484225) (RC1). What makes this play truly ridiculous is the unprecedented 14.1:1 ratio on the chart, something not often heard of for speed-heavy 7K charts.
- ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Koyu_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33328421) gave us quite a show by obtaining a clean full combo on [Dionela - Marilag](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495166#mania/5484301) (LN1). Their 976k run on the chart helped their team hit match point against Macau. We'd also like to give a shout-out to the player mentioned earlier, ::{ flag=PH }:: [bojii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083439), for the best accuracy (99.41%) on the chart over the weekend.
- Team Sweden's ::{ flag=SE }:: [venyez](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15927535) was *on fire* by scoring 992k on [NIWASHI – Sapphire On Fire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495159#mania/5484255) (HB3), in fact, their run was the only one that breached the 990k mark. If anything, we'd suggest that you look into their phenomenal performances throughout the weekend — keep an eye out for ::{ flag=SE }:: [venyez](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15927535) during the Quarterfinals!
- Last but not least, we had to mention the strong ratios of the South Korean pair ::{ flag=KR }:: [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406) and ::{ flag=KR }:: [Kalkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10790649), who gave us a combined **1.981 million team score** on [EmoCosine - Love Pills](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2495158#mania/5484254) (EX1). Props to the returning Brazilian superstar ::{ flag=BR }:: [SillyFangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288363) who did not show any signs of rust at all, as made evident by their 990k run on the chart.
