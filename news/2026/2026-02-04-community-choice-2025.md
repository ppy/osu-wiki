Let's look back on 2025 and see which beatmaps made resounding impact on the community last year!

With 18 years of mapping under our belts, one constant has remained: the community's insatiable appetite for the best beatmaps. This is where Community Choice comes in — a yearly tradition where we all get together and decide which maps deserve to be recognised as the best of the best.

You'll have **10 votes per game mode** to cast on **any map ranked during 2025 that you have played at least once**. Each game mode's contest listing will automagically conjure up all the eligible maps that you can vote in.

Once votes are tallied up after **14 days**, the top 10 beatmaps will be dubbed as the *Community Favourites of 2025* and earning their mappers 1 month of osu!supporter each. However, the creators of the #1 beatmaps will be bestowed with a prestigious profile badge, alongside 6 months of osu!supporter.

We didn't forget about our dear mappers. As tradition dictates, anyone with at least one ranked map will have their votes count towards the *Mapper's Favourite* award for each game mode, alongside the main polls. This all happens automatically, so make sure to cast your votes so your favourite maps have their due justice.

Before we proceed, let's circle back on last year's beatmapping trends:
