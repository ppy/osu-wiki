## The 2025 Rankings: China's Top 15 osu! players of 2025

The time has come to reflect on the progress made over the past year. Throughout 2025, we've seen players continue to push their own limits and stay active in the competitive scene. 

To commemorate these efforts, we've put together a video featuring the **China's Top 15 osu! players of 2025**. This ranking highlights the players who showed impressive consistency and made their mark on the scene — whether through dominant tournament performances or climbing the global leaderboards — over the last twelve months.

## A Year in Mapping

A Year in Mapping (AYIM) was originally a cornerstone of the [Mapper's Choice Awards (MCA)](https://mca.corsace.io/), designed to curate annual ranking data and provide personalized feedback for every mapper who had a set ranked that year. After the project entered a hiatus in 2018, [kanor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3131236) took the initiative in 2020 to launch the first "Chinese Mapper Annual Review", reigniting the flame for this community tradition. Following the stewardship of [Antigen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10507557) and [Arsalan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7660383) in 2023, the torch was passed to us ([MarioKartya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16833061), [AstralXynsm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16022233) and [Luval](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22414293)) in 2024 to carry on the legacy of AYIM within the Chinese mapping community.

2025 has been a vibrant year, with a total of **143 Chinese mappers** successfully getting their maps ranked. Most notably, we celebrated **22 debutant mappers** who achieved their very first ranked sets this year — a heartening increase compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the return of veteran mappers such as [cRyo[iceeicee]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/835998) and [Chloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/787542) brought fresh surprises to the community. We are truly honored to capture every highlight and milestone within the Chinese mapping scene through this event.

This time, we cordially invite everyone to send New Year's wishes or a shout-out to your favorite Chinese mappers for their incredible work over the past year. Please share your thoughts via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScT-pDozmZtLtl6BfBpFtlNC4e_TM3HgbDy-3nc7DktB9b3Sg/viewform?usp=publish-editor)!

## Tournament wrap-up

The year 2025 has been a monumental milestone for the osu! competitive scene within the Chinese community. From record-breaking LAN events to the unwavering spirit displayed on the World Cup stage, every match has carved out a unique memory for this year.

### The summer of LANs

This past summer saw the largest and most frequent wave of offline competitions in history, with three major events spanning Shanghai, Guangzhou, and New Taipei City.

- **[China LAN 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2080306?n=1)** (Shanghai): Held in July, this was the largest Mainland China offline tournament featuring both osu! and osu!mania 4K in nearly seven years. In collaboration with the **dotream Rhythm Game Carnival (缀梦音游嘉年华)**, the event garnered unprecedented attention, showcasing the unique charm of osu! to a vast audience of rhythm game enthusiasts. It was a joyful and unforgettable experience for all attendees, setting a fresh new standard for offline production. Ultimately, ::{ flag=HK }:: [mcy4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2165650) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [DawnX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8534840) emerged as the respective champions.
- **[OCNCC S2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2083250?n=1)** (Guangzhou): Taking place in early August in Panyu, this event primarily targeted players from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. Despite the venue's size, the atmosphere was electric, culminating in a final where ::{ flag=HK }:: [-xxx Rumia-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5936405) defeated ::{ flag=CN }:: [Firia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9164037) 6-4 to take the title.
- **[otst:live!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2095985?n=1)** (New Taipei City): At the end of August, the historic OTST series returned from its hiatus since 2022 — this time in an offline format — marking the first-ever officially supported offline tournament to take place in Taiwan. The event highlighted the rise of a new generation of Taiwanese players, with ::{ flag=TW }:: [GAO HAO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8964050) narrowly defeating ::{ flag=TW }:: [willy0214](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8660293) 7-6 in a thrilling grand final.

These three LAN events also introduced several new original tracks to the community:

### World Cup series: veterans and new blood

The performance of local teams in the World Cup series has been equally remarkable over the past year.

- **osu! World Cup**: ::{ flag=CN }:: China and ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan maintained steady performances, securing **Top 12** and **Top 16** placements respectively. ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong, despite a major roster overhaul, advanced through Qualifiers as the #40 seed. In a notable Group Stage encounter against ::{ flag=GR }:: Greece, ::{ flag=HK }:: [misha awa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14503423) played all 9 maps with a staggering 2.3 matchcost to **lead a 5:4 comeback victory**, securing a hard-fought win to close out their campaign. Meanwhile, ::{ flag=MO }:: Macau showed significant growth following their 2024 return after a decade-long hiatus. They achieved a notably higher Qualifier rank this year with a compact 7-player roster, proving that even small communities possess immense vitality.
- **Other World Cup series**: ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan continued its legacy as a powerhouse in the **osu!taiko World Cup**, securing **3rd place**. ::{ flag=CN }:: China returned to the podium in the **osu!mania 7k World Cup** with a **2nd place** finish and made history in the **osu!mania 4k World Cup** by taking the **#1 Seed** in Qualifiers — the first time a Chinese team has achieved the top seed in a World Cup series.

### Diverse community circuit

The Chinese community also hosted a rich variety of smaller-scale tournaments throughout 2025:

- **[5 Digit Taiwanese Showdown 2.5](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2029518?n=1) & [3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2110474?n=1)**: These two iterations saw ::{ flag=TW }:: [[ Luka ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11923800) and ::{ flag=TW }:: [YoYu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10391882) take their respective titles, proving themselves as the future of the Taiwanese scene.
- **[Osu For Fun Cup 5](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2074099?n=1)**: Featuring a KOF-style format, this tournament required strategic planning to balance skill gaps within teams. Team **daiimu到處欠錢** (::{ flag=TW }:: [GAO HAO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8964050),::{ flag=TW }:: [koutya_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14912108), ::{ flag=CN }:: [Firia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9164037), ::{ flag=TW }:: [zomcys](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1580033)) ultimately claimed victory.
- **[Hello! Shanden Cup 5 : Limit Break](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2142841?n=1)**: The year-end finale featured a "Limit Break" theme with more complex rules and difficult mappools. Team **大家好我是陳義與...** (::{ flag=TW }:: [daiimu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17792515), ::{ flag=TW }:: [Summer_Ouo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15184992), ::{ flag=TW }:: [YoYu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10391882), ::{ flag=TW }:: [[ Luka ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11923800)) emerged victorious after an intense two-set grand final.

Congratulations to all the staff and players for an incredible year of competition — **GGWP**!

## Contest wrap-up

In the competitive mapping scene, **2025** has proven to be a rewarding year for the Great China mapping community, marked by standout performances across a wide selection of mapping contests.

One of the most exciting achievements was the **[Locus](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-08-21-locus-2025-results)** contest, where composers, mappers, and artists collaborate to create a "full-stack beatmap" - a complete mapset featuring an original song, a full spread of difficulties, and original visual assets.

The team **Locus of Hexagram**, consisting of ::{ flag=HK }:: [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552), ::{ flag=HK }:: [Otosaka-Yu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3170678), ::{ flag=HK }:: [seros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10562853), ::{ flag=KR }:: [momoyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12469536), and ::{ flag=JP }:: [TARA-376](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/37407910), claimed **1st place in the Community Pick**, showcasing a contribution widely appreciated by the osu! community. Their [beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2412260) are bundled with the osu! client, so be sure to check it out!

In the **[osu! Beatmapping World Championship (o!bwc)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-11-25-osu-beatmapping-world-championship-2025-results)**, the ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan Team consisting of ::{ flag=TW }:: [Plus4j](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4086497), ::{ flag=TW }:: [Matsuyuki Ame](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12763959), ::{ flag=TW }:: [Flask](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/959763), ::{ flag=TW }:: [Imokora](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2472609), ::{ flag=TW }:: [9ami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1499997), and ::{ flag=TW }:: [Alty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16407988), delivered an outstanding performance. Competing against over 60 teams from more than 20 countries, they distinguished themselves in fierce international competition and secured an impressive **3rd place**.

In **[Vocaloid Mapping Contest #3](https://www.vat.gg/vmc3)**, the duo of ::{ flag=CN }:: **[Garden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2849992)** and ::{ flag=CN }:: **[iBell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4298072)** took **1st place in Phase 1**. With Phase 2 currently underway, the competition remains intense. Check it out if you love vocaloids, or you just want to support their continued journey!

</div>

::{ flag=CN }:: **[iBell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4298072)** also appeared on the podium in individual mapper contests, claiming **1st place** in the **[Summer Mapping Contest 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-06-14-summer-mapping-contest-2)**. This marks their **second consecutive championship** in the event, earning enough [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) to be awarded the **Elite Mapper** title.

Another "second time champion" highlight came from **[Pending Cup 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-24-pending-cup-2025)**: ::{ flag=TW }:: **[Matsuyuki Ame](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12763959)** once again ranked first along in one of the three contest tracks. They reaffirmed their consistent excellence in the Pending Cup!

2025 is also a fruitful year for novice mappers. **[Newspaper Cup 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-29-newspaper-cup-2025)** highlighted the rise of new talent from the Chinese mapping community: Three novice mappers ::{ flag=CN }:: **[PEALEERD_TAK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6214002)**, ::{ flag=CN }:: **[Mimosa M](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24010320)**, and ::{ flag=CN }:: **[YeLing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14726718)** swept the **top three positions**. Want to be one of them? Submissions phase for **[Newspaper Cup 2026](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/270)** are now nearing the end, and new mappers are strongly encouraged not to miss this valuable opportunity to step onto the competitive stage!

On the momentum of a highly successful **2025**, let's wish the best to the Chinese mappers across mapping contests in **2026**!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-16-happy-chinese-new-year/btmc.png)

As one of osu!'s most prominent content creators and a notable Chinese-American figure, [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) has made immense contributions to the global community. His success demonstrates how a shared passion for the game can resonate across all cultural boundaries.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

As a Chinese American, you have a unique perspective on both Western and Eastern communities. When you see fans from the Chinese-speaking scene supporting your content or even using your memes, does it feel different to know that your influence reaches so far across cultural lines?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/BTMC.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691">BTMC</a></p>

Having a global platform is something I’ll never take for granted. Just as people found me through my content, creating content helped me find my people. Growing up, it was rare to find anyone interested in YouTube, Twitch, or the specific niches I dove into. Crossing those cultural lines allowed me to connect with people just like me from all over the world.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7825227" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FcEazy.jpg')"></a>

Through The Roundtable, you've built a global stage that connects players in the real world, and we're seeing a growing wave of LAN events popping up everywhere as a result. In fact, seeing the passion and community spirit you fostered with your event was a huge inspiration for me. This past year, I personally hosted and witnessed that same incredible energy when we brought our community together for China LAN 2025 — the largest offline event in our region in seven years. Heading into the new year, is there anything you'd like to share with future organizers, or with the fans and players who haven't yet had the chance to experience an offline event?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/BTMC.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691">BTMC</a></p>

Events aren't made for profit; they’re made for passion. I've spent years trying to crack the code on how to make recurring events sustainable, and the reality is they’re impossible without the hundreds of people willing to volunteer their time and skills. Despite the struggle, events consistently create moments that leave a lasting impact, building memories and friendships you’ll never forget. You simply cannot replicate that feeling of belonging online. But because profit incentives are rare, events constantly struggle to survive, mine included. So, support your favorite events. Watch, attend, volunteer, and be the change you want to see.

To wrap things up on a more personal note — Chinese New Year is as much about the food as it is about the celebration! For your family, what is that one "must-have" dish on the table during the Chinese New Year? Is there a specific food that instantly makes it feel like the holidays for you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/BTMC.jpg')"></a>

My mom used to make the best lamb dumplings in the world, doing the dough and filling entirely from scratch. I grew up helping her, but I always sucked at wrapping them. There’s just some "hidden tech" I’m missing. To this day, no other dumpling has come close, but I get by with pork soup dumplings from Costco. If I can't beat her on taste, at least I can win on convenience and value.

Both [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669) and [pw384](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783) are veteran figures who have significantly shaped the identity of "Chinese Mapping". While yf_bmp is a highly respected veteran known for his deep legacy, pw384 is recognized for his long-standing ability to evolve alongside the ever-changing trends of the scene.

In 2025, the Chinese-speaking mapping scene achieved a lot. For instance, in the osu! Beatmapping World Championship (o!BWC), team China — composed almost entirely of new mappers — advanced to the Top 16, while the team Taiwan secured a 3rd place finish. Do you think the trend of the Chinese mapping scene is looking up? Is Chinese mapping back?

It is definitely a good sign that the regime of Chinese mapping has been changing and that the recent new mappers are taking the leading role. On the other hand, it has been a decade-long tradition to conform with the norms of mapping, which I believe more experienced mappers shall revisit and take the risk of breaking.

In the osu! community, we often discuss "Chinese Mapping" as a distinct style. As one of its core pillars, could you introduce how this school of mapping originated and who the pioneers were? Also, which mappers have had the greatest influence on your own style over the years?

Regarding Chinese Mapping, I believe that it evolved from the strong structural focus led by [tsuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/106767), [kiddly](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/74937), and [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699), alongside other influential branches like [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679) and [LKs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/150768). In the "modern" era, [Skystar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961) played a pivotal role; he studied a lot of Chinese styles — I recall him mentioning how his [Rohi - Kakuzetsu Thanatos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/76396#osu/215906) was sent back for revisions multiple times by NatsumeRin, which heavily influenced his early work. fanzhen0019 also remains a cornerstone, as he has continuously reinvented himself from the early days to now, maintaining his status as a benchmark. If we’re talking about the modern era, since mapping has become highly saturated, it’s really hard to define Chinese mapping as a single person’s style. However, I do believe there are the following defining traits.
  
First of all is the structural logic — a logic present in both rhythm and visuals. Every slider and circle has a concrete reason for its placement and orientation; it's never arbitrary. The rhythm is chosen with intent, maintaining internal consistency from start to finish. It's inherently logical. Another hallmark is Playability. A commonality among these pioneers is their experience with other rhythm games, especially arcade ones. They draw from commercial rhythm game design — learning how to make a map "addictive", how to balance complexity with non-traditional rhythms, and how to create "peaks" that make players want to hit that retry button again and again.
  
As for my own style, [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679) (2012-2014) was my biggest early influence; much of my rhythm choice, overlaps, and slider shapes can be traced back there. In the middle stage (2015-2016), I studied [Skystar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961), the master who synthesized these styles with his own ideas. Later (2016-2018), I began exploring my own potential and realized that [fanzhen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699)'s maps were in a league of their own regarding playability, so I spent a long time learning from him. Finally, in 2019, I integrated [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717)'s rigid, high-difficulty expression. Since then, it's been about fine-tuning that 2019 version (e.g., mimicking [Kencho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178411)'s flow or studying various old maps), though my energy has shifted toward my career. It took me seven years to finally feel satisfied with my own mapping.

We've also seen many new mappers emerge in 2025. Who do you think is the most promising mapper right now?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/pw384.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783">pw384</a></p>

I would venture to say that [WhiteCookies](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13617153) is the most impressive new mapper in 2025, and highly recommend you to take a look at his 1st ranked map—an extremely well-structured one with simple visuals but dedicated flow design. I am pretty sure it would be such an impossible achievement without his excellent playing skills. It is an honor for me to be one of the nominators.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/yf_bmp.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669">yf_bmp</a></p>

I haven't followed the community as closely lately, but I believe that if a mapper truly understands that a beatmap is essentially **"Level Design"** and approaches it with a "research and development" mindset, their work will naturally radiate outward and show immense potential. The opposite is "inward" mapping — focusing purely on personal spiritual expression. While that's fine for self-satisfaction, it's much harder for that style to resonate with others.

Looking ahead to the Year of the Horse, do you have any messages or expectations for the Chinese mapping community as a whole?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/pw384.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783">pw384</a></p>

I look forward to seeing more mappers step outside their comfort zones to explore unique styles. Let's keep the momentum going and continue to bring fresh ideas to the game.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/yf_bmp.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669">yf_bmp</a></p>

What I look forward to most is the rise of a new generation. As someone you consider a "pillar", what I truly hope for is to see newcomers charging forward and eventually taking over the torch — I don't want to see a stagnant pool.

Beyond hard work and skill, one crucial piece of advice: Utilize your resources and networks. Socializing and connecting are a prerequisite; building in isolation is not the way. The older generation shouldn't be the ones leading you; instead, you should be brave enough to step forward. When you need a hand, ask us for a boost, then keep pushing ahead. Furthermore, look beyond just mapping — specialize in other areas too. Whether it's Hitsounding (like [TtmnZk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2495509)), Storyboard (which is in high demand but has few specialists), becoming a NAT, or even a Developer (a role I am currently transitioning into).

But remember: The path is yours to walk. Be yourself. Don't change your beliefs just because of what I've said. The "community" is not a mandatory mission — you can stay independent from any circle and still be your most brilliant self.

Within the Chinese-speaking scene, [Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397) is a symbol of resilience. A mainstay of the China OWC roster since 2016, his decade-long consistency has made him a living legend for local players across multiple generations.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7825227" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/FcEazy.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7825227">FcEazy</a></p>

You've been a mainstay of the OWC roster since 2016, and you've seen the lineup change significantly. Even within the current roster, many players are considering stepping away. Although you mentioned last year that you'd likely stay active, do you see yourself becoming a part of the team's history in the near future? Why? What keeps you from leaving — does it stem from your personal philosophy or attitude toward tournaments?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Crystal.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397">Crystal</a></p>

If there comes a day when I am no longer ranked among the top eight for the OWC team, it would simply mean that our collective skill level has become strong enough. I would be more than happy to see that happen, and I am perfectly fine to fade from the spotlight and become a part of history. 

But to address your point about the broader trend of players leaving — it is undeniable that the average age of our OWC players is relatively high compared to the rest of the world. Many members have transitioned from being students to working professionals. When facing the pressures of life, everyone does indeed encounter the challenge of trying to balance both sides.

But one thing I am certain of: when the team really needs us, we veterans will definitely still be willing to step up. This holds true for me, and I believe it’s the same for my teammates as well. As long as there is something I can do, I will always be willing to contribute my strength.

[Imokora](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2472609) and [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656) are key staff members who provide the backbone for the tournament scene. Imokora is a tireless pillar within the Chinese-speaking community, while chiv serves as a vital bridge, lending his international expertise to support and elevate local tournaments.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

Having worked with both of you on numerous projects, I've always valued your unique "insider-outsider" perspectives. chiv, you are a mainstay of the international staff scene who frequently lends your expertise to Chinese tournaments; Imokora, you are one of the pillars of the Chinese-speaking community who has become increasingly active in major international events.

Based on your extensive experience in both hosting and pooling, where do you see the biggest differences between the Chinese-speaking tournaments and the broader international scene?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2472609" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Imokora.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2472609">Imokora</a></p>

Throughout the years, our tournament scene has consistently remained active and thriving.

From our legacy tournaments, such as: OCWT, OCL, LLC, OTST, TST, and the TTT series, to the new generation of series like: CYT, BWC, 5TS, OFFC, and TSC... well, i guess OTST is back too (yep we are still kicking). The sprout has never stopped growing, all made possible by our tireless community contributors!

I believe this unstoppable momentum is what defines us unique apart from the other communities!

Not to mention how close-knit we are. Without language barriers between us, we naturally share a larger player base, and people are genuinely kind to one another.
New ideas are welcomed, and constructive feedback is always given to help strengthen the content and make everything more enjoyable.

Kindness may not seem like a rare trait, but it's something I deeply cherish about our community!

Despite our differences, osu! is what holds us together, and I believe that connection is something precious worth holding onto. Every now and then, I find myself reflecting on this: I cherish this community just as deeply as I love this game, from the bottom of my heart. I'm truly grateful for the people I've met along the way, and my sincerest thanks to everyone who has been part of this journey. Somehow this sounds like a farewell message for osu!, but I believe we still have many years ahead of us!

Happy Chinese New Year, everyone. Let's continue to give our very best this year and create even more unforgettable memories together! :steamhappy:

The contrast between international tournaments and Chinese region-locked ones shows itself in countless ways. While "quality" is subjective, there's something uniquely charming about each Chinese tournament. From polished mappools and graphics, to the incredible dedication of staff members and the welcoming playerbase, it's always a pleasure seeing Chinese tournaments come around.

There are also several figureheads in the Chinese community who've set a strong standard for respect and quality through their dedication and professionalism. The lolol squad and Crystal have built a long-standing tournament presence that continues to shape the scene. 

At the same time, many mappers help support and elevate the community, including [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552), [Garden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2849992), and [Ryuusei Aika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7777875). Organizers like [FcEazy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7825227) and [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) also set a gold standard for tournament organization. With so many people pushing things forward, it's no surprise to see the bar being raised with every experience.

How would you define the unique "philosophy" behind mappools in Chinese-speaking tournaments?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2472609" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Imokora.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2472609">Imokora</a></p>

One thing I really love about our community's mappools is their experimental nature.
Whether it's breaking down traditional structures like 5TS, implementing a delicate designed ruleset like OFFC, or something like Shanden Cup that blends creativity from both sides, there's always a willingness to try something new. This creative energy pushes every tournament to be a completely unique experience, and that's the most charming part!

It seems that after all, our inner Yutang Cup spirit lives on, alive and well!

It's also fascinating to see how we integrate custom maps into our mappools.
From this year alone: CYT:NE, China LAN, and otst:live! together accumulated over 60 customs, and the sheer number isn't even the most impressive part. When you look at each creation individually, you can really see the level of quality that's been consistently maintained.

All of this is made possible by the strong infrastructure and supportive environment we've built, that nurtures both the mapping and tournament scenes, leading to so many generational creations.

I'm really excited to see what the future holds for us!

Looking toward 2026, what international trends would you love to see the community to explore more?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/chiv.jpg')"></a>

From the players, to the mappers, and all the staff in between, it'd be incredible to see parts of the Chinese community branch out into more international opportunities. There's a ton of dedication and talent hidden behind region-locked tournaments and contests, and exploring new horizons would definitely help diversify the game as a whole.

On the other side, there are hundreds of members in our community without Chinese flags who still have roots in China. Despite having a Canadian flag, it's been awesome being able to interact with Chinese tournaments like China LAN, and I hope to see some familiar faces get acquainted with the level of quality and dedication they bring.
