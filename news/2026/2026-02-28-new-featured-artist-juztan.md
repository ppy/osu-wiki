Music made for osu! players, by an osu! player. What more could you ask for?

When **Juztan** isn't busy setting 1000pp plays, he's knee-deep in a his digital audio workspace crafting music perfectly suited for circle clicking.

Ever since learning about music production, he's been exploring hardcore EDM with dreams of producing songs akin to those by [*7_7*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/356), [*katagiri*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176) and [*Slax*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/465). A glance at osu!'s Ranked section proves that those dreams are becoming reality. 

Multiple of **Juztan**'s remixes are iconic in osu! already, with [American Girls (Juztan Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2352698) amassing millions of plays from osu!'s agriculture enthusiasts (also known as pp farmers).

Meanwhile in [**Juztan**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/531), we're highlighting **4** of his original tracks, each of which exploit the same hardcore elements as his remixes to create equally catchy and complex tunes!

If you're reading this, you already know that music is best experienced in sync with an awesome map. Witness an example below, then make your own with any of the pre-timed `.osz` files on [**Juztan**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/531)!

### Juztan - Ba11istiC

*EPIC.LAN 47* happened in the United Kingdom last weekend, dragging osu! players out of their homes and into the real world.
