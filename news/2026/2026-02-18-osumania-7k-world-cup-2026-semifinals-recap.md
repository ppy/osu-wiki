Spring draws near, and with it the tournament's final rounds. Join us as we recap what's soon to be all team's final places before Finals and Grand Finals!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-18-osumania-7k-world-cup-2026-semifinals-recap/banner.jpg)

We're at the very last stretch of the tournament. Time went by so fast. After all, time goes by much faster when you're enjoying yourself — this is a perfect case example! On the other hand, players have only been sweating buckets for as long as they stepped into their Qualifiers lobbies. With the Grand Finals drawing extremely close and the podium being just a breath away, leaving empty-handed would be soul crushing.

Despite the pressure, every team has been performing at the highest level! And so they should, for all teams are increasingly facing harder opponents as both mappools and competitors get tougher. This round was no exception, bringing us many memorable moments along the way. We even got to witness a Latin American derby with Peru and Venezuela fighting for their spot in the losers' bracket!

It would not be a proper recap without our weekly video highlights, however. Thanks again to [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), [epic man 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000), [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895), and [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622) for their incredible work throughout the tournament. And there's more to come!

![Semifinals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-18-osumania-7k-world-cup-2026-semifinals-recap/mappool-sf.jpg)

While the Semifinals pool contained the same amount of maps as the Quarterfinals with both rounds following the same best-of-11 match format, the difficulty was substantially higher. Maps would start to become a bit more challenging, even for the best of players!

Among these there were some standouts, however. The first one being [qfeileadh feat. Resonance Moeko - Petals ~Mebuku Kotoba~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501756#mania/5504374) (RC1) by ::{ flag=KR }:: [taba2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7850508) which was one of the pool's osu! originals for the week. While it unfortunately wasn't played in any of the matches, this was done purely for strategic reasons — the map holds no punches! Don't be fooled by its amazing graphics, else you won't be able to keep up with its very tricky and fast-paced broken and delayed streams.

Another map worth to mention was [t+pazolite & Nanahira - Screamin' Showcase](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501722#mania/5504288) (LN3) by ::{ flag=CN }:: [Ulazis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11144363) which quickly became one of the most played, and we presume liked, maps of the pool. While the map boasts of many breaks when compared to other slots, its difficulty and density is quite consistent all throughout the map. Its choruses are particularly tricky, with the introduction of inverse shields on an already coordination-demanding pick not making things any easier.

---

Finally, and as we have spoiled before, this round hosted not one, not two, but three brand new [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) for everyone to enjoy!

While it may've remained unplayed during the weekend, [Petals ~Mebuku Kotoba~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501756#mania/5504374) was a sight to behold. This composition made by [qfeileadh](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/525) and brought to life by the mapper and design team was one of the showcase centerpieces. It's not easy to cause this much of an impact without being featured in any matches. That's an incredible feat in and of itself!

[Seisen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501764#mania/5504387) is the most recent contribution to osu! by the well-known artist [ARForest](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/95). Mapped by [kaulpakka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7115625) and [Remuring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6522146), this hybrid set offers a good mix of patterns, with a heavy emphasis on rice and long note coordination during its faster sections. The ending in particular blends both skill sets in a very organic way, slowly creeping up the difficulty as rice transitions into long notes as the last chorus creeps up.

[Vacant Rhapsody](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501778#mania/5504474) was the pool's tiebreaker for the weekend, as well as its last featured osu! original. It would be an understatement to say [penoreri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526) overdelivered with their first featured track in the game! The map didn't disappoint either, as both [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) and [_Kobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713) collaborated to bring the mappool's capstone to life. Not an easy beatmap, even for the Semifinals' standards. Teams should have been relieved to see they wouldn't have to play it during their matches, but we're more than sure they'll happily play it once the tournament is over!

## Semifinals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |

If there's a word to describe the osu!mania 7K World Cup this year, it would be "surprise". We may've reused that word quite a bit throughout the recaps, and yet we believe we've been underusing it. Who could've predicted we would be seeing a Latin American skirmish in the 7K World Cup, let alone in a round as advanced as the Semifinals?!

While we still try to wrap our heads around that, other standouts during the week worth mentioning were definitely the Philippines versus China, and our main highlight for this recap: the United States versus Hong Kong!

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong

</div>

We had an unexpected matchup during the Semifinals between the United States (#9) and Hong Kong (#7). Both teams have much to win (and lose!) as this match will determine who'll secure a spot for the Finals. We were not ready for how many plot twists and nail-biting moments we would experience, as this match is bound to be one of the tournament's top highlights!

The United States opened the match with [Aoi - Caelum](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501643#mania/5504072) (HB1), which was immediately shut down by Hong Kong, taking the first break point of the match with a 54,244-point lead! This momentum carried out to the second pick with another victory, forcing the United States to respond with [Lime - Chronomia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501734#mania/5504332) (RC3). This point was way closer, with the score fluctuating by only a few hundred points. However, a miss at the very last moment caused the United States to hand out the point to Hong Kong by a very narrow 2,899-point margin.

With a commanding 4–0 lead, many expected Hong Kong to be inches away from victory. However, the United States began their comeback by choosing the chordjack map [MYUKKE. - The 89's Momentum](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501740#mania/5504354) (RC4), capitalizing on their rice prowess. They secured their first point with an impressive score of 995,119 from the hands of ::{ flag=US }:: [logann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24675802). The winds seemed to be in the United States' favour as they quickly claimed two more victories, narrowing the score to 4–3 and raising expectations for a potential reverse sweep!

Hong Kong was not going to let their close-to-be match point slip away. By picking [DJ Noriken feat. Hoshina Haru - AOHARU INFINITY (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501723#mania/5504289) (EX2), a rather demanding and dense long note map, they would be playing in their home turf. This secured them another win and placed them right next to the match's finish line! The United States, despite the crushing weight on their shoulders, managed to secure one more point bringing the score to 5–4 in Hong Kong's favour and being one point away from a tiebreaker!

After a long while, Hong Kong ultimately opted to play [kanemiko - Cold Fusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501772#mania/5504414) (EX3). Based on their performance insofar, they initially appeared to have the upper hand. In spite of that, the United States put on a very strong fight. By keeping the score gap at a minimum and trading the lead multiple times, the point was contested all throughout the map. But after a fierce back-and-forth, Hong Kong ultimately came up on top with a fairly narrow 5,497-point lead, denying the United States a tiebreaker and advancing to the Finals!

Congratulations to Hong Kong for the win! It was a nerve-wracking encounter filled with tension all throughout the match. Kudos to the United States for their relentless effort until the very end even when faced with such an initial lead to overcome! We look forward for them return in 2027.

In the rhythm game world, [penoreri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526) needs little introduction. He's made his mark with major titles like Konami's SOUND VOLTEX, crafting tracks that are challenging, melodic, and full of energy. Many of his compositions have become fan favorites while testing the skills of top players. And with that, it is only right that he was invited to compose the Semifinals Tiebreaker for the osu!mania 7K World Cup 2026 - a track that perfectly captures the intensity of a stage where only the top players compete!

Hi penoreri! It's great to finally have you compose an original song for osu!. [Vacant Rhapsody](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501778#mania/5504474) has been incredibly well received, with many listeners praising its expressive structure and musicality. The piece showcases a wide range of influences, and you even performed the guitar parts yourself, including a section you described as being inspired by [Jordan Rudess](https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanRudessKeys). Which instruments do you enjoy playing most when producing, and how does performing them yourself influence the way you compose?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/penoreri.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526">penoreri</a></p>

My main instruments are piano and keyboards, but in recent years I've also increasingly been playing the guitar. The guitar allows me to create phrases and express emotions that wouldn't come to mind — or couldn't be conveyed in the same way — on a keyboard, so it has become an invaluable tool for me when composing.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/_Kobii_.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713">_Kobii_</a></p>

How do you balance musical expression with the technical constraints of rhythm games, such as rhythmic structure and overall length? Were there any particular challenges in achieving this while still maintaining musical coherence?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/penoreri.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526">penoreri</a></p>

Balancing musical expression with rhythm game difficulty is something I'm constantly thinking about. Especially in sections that function as the chorus, I try to use memorable melodies, but sometimes that can naturally lower the map difficulty. To compensate, I add detailed obbligato lines and subtle rhythmic elements to maintain the level of challenge expected in a rhythm game.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/_Kobii_.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713">_Kobii_</a></p>

In recent years, you've been focused mostly on commercial works. With that in mind, are there any plans to release a new album? Your last album was released back in 2015, and I'm sure long-time fans would love to hear a new full-length release from you.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/penoreri.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526">penoreri</a></p>

At the moment, I don't have any plans to release an album, but that doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. Depending on my circumstances and mindset, there's always a possibility that I may decide to work on one.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2026-02-18-osumania-7k-world-cup-2026-semifinals-recap/Amphy-banner.png)

The World Cup Design Team has always been exploring more ways to bring different creative mediums to the tournament scene, and photography has been playing an increasingly important role in that process. Some of you may recognize [Amphy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223) from his photography work on last year's [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220) songs. This time, his photos became the design foundation for the whole project, giving the design team a chance to explore new creative directions by combining photography with animated graphic design for [Vacant Rhapsody](https://youtu.be/G9JdmWW5BsQ) by [penoreri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/526).

Don't forget to also check out Amphy's photography work on the five Marmalade butcher songs from last year's World Cups, including [CuttingEdgeInsaneArtifact](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2321277#mania/4973089), [=_=Virtual Futural](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347292#taiko/5048649), [SUTEGORO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955), [SIX BILLION MNSN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2432002#mania/5298351), and [Open Scar Unending](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471983#mania/5416140).

Hi Amphy! It's really exciting for us to finally have the chance to interview a photographer, especially as photography has been playing a bigger role in our design projects. This feels like a good opportunity for us to learn more about your work and creative perspective. To start things off, could you introduce yourself and share a bit about your background?


<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Amphy.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223">Amphy</a></p>

Hi, of course. My name is Amphy, and I'm from Wales. I've been doing photography for most of my life, but only recently fully committing to it and experimenting with alternative processes. There's something sweet about seeing the world through a form that isn't your own, even though I'm the one deciding what to take pictures of. My mom constantly gave me disposable cameras to play around with, which is no surprise since she loved making photo projects too.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

Almost all your photography focuses on nature, scenery, and landscapes, which is very rare in the osu! design space. When you're out shooting, what kind of atmosphere are you usually trying to capture through your photos?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Amphy.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223">Amphy</a></p>

I think specifically where I'm from is why I take so many photos of natural subjects, trying to show what the world has to offer. The atmosphere you mention is not really something I honestly think about haha. I think I'm just drawn to these sorts of things. Despite that, with my "False Colour" or Infrared work, I definitely try to create landscapes that feel almost like a dream; things are coherent but don't quite make sense. This is especially true for Marmalade butcher's [=_=Virtual Futural](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347292#taiko/5048649).

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

In the past, photography hasn't always been the main focus in osu! originals, and graphic design is often seen as just backgrounds or banners. How did you feel about the creative approach we took for this project? What was it like collaborating with the other designers to bring photography and animated graphic design together?


<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Amphy.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223">Amphy</a></p>

I've never really collaborated with creative work before and it was really fun! It was a good opportunity and it was amazing seeing all the different art styles and pieces of work come together. I had fun being able to contribute to penoreri's style of music with my photographs of flowers! It is definitely something I would like to try again since I can't make these animated graphic designs myself. I found it really impressive how the other designers split up the design work and produced varying styles to match the different sections of the song.

It's inspiring to see new creative mediums being introduced to the tournament scene. Are there any creative directions you would be excited to explore while photography continues to play a bigger role in future World Cup projects?

I definitely want to work more with traditional formats like film. With film, there are so many ways you can manipulate the negative to produce different results, and there's something called "film soup" that I'm itching to try. I would also love to try out more things with alternative processes like [cyanotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype).

## Score highlights

While we enter the latter half of the tournament, the pools have quickly ramped up in difficulty as opposed to the Quarterfinals. Everyone was determined to do their utmost to help their teams enter the Finals weekend despite the challenges. Here are some of the performances worth highlighting:

- ::{ flag=PH }:: [bojii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083439) makes another return to this section of the news post with a phenomenal 997k score on [P4koo - Illusion of Mind](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501633#mania/5504046) (RC2). This score featured a 22.1 rainbow 300 ratio that left a ~5,000 point gap over the entire lobby. This was anything but an *illusion*.
- Team Thailand's resident noodle-slurper ::{ flag=TH }:: [LostCool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766374) gave us the week's best score on [satella feat. Aitsuki Nakuru - Irith (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501771#mania/5504413) (LN4) on their crucial match against Canada. To our knowledge, this is the only score on the chart that hit 990k which is also a full combo.
- Japanese superstar ::{ flag=JP }:: [Suzuha_l](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6132697)'s 972.7k full combo effort on [Poisonless Snail - Jazzor T Ver.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501631#mania/5504039) (HB3) on their match against Australia may be a score that might fly over most people's heads, but we won't allow that! This was set on one of the most technical charts on the pool, and that is quite something.
- The EX category was topped by two of the players we just mentioned. ::{ flag=PH }:: [bojii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083439) took the lead on [VeetaCrush - Sesame Kingdom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501597#mania/5503894) (EX1), also showing their prowess in accuracy. Both [DJ Noriken feat. Hoshina Haru - AOHARU INFINITY (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501723#mania/5504289) (EX2) and [kanemiko - Cold Fusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2501772#mania/5504414) (EX3) were topped by the outgoing ::{ flag=TH }:: [LostCool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766374). Unfortunately, we won't see them around anymore, but we do hope we'll see Thailand return stronger next year.
