Additionally, **NPC 2026 is exclusive for novice mappers.** You must satisfy all of the following eligibility criteria:

## Songs

There will be **two categories to compete in** for NPC 2026:

- **Featured Artist**: You are free to choose any track listed in the [Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists), **except osu! originals** (otherwise you're in the below category). *Reasonable cutting is allowed.*
- **osu! original**. You are free to choose any track listed in the Featured Artist library that are tagged as [osu! originals](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks?exclusive_only=1). *Cutting is **NOT allowed** for these tracks.*

## Judging

| Criterion | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Expertise (50%)** | How well the map reflects the music elements, with emphasis on music reflection, pattern/rhythm consistency, coherence, and playability. As NPC is for novice mappers, judges will focus more on **solid fundamental execution** as the primary objective. |
| **Creativity (35%)** | How the map stands out compared to current mapping trends and other submissions. Generic maps or copy-paste concepts are discouraged. Creativity built on top of solid expertise is highly valued. |
| **Judge's Impression (15%)** | Judges may award or deduct points based on noteworthy aspects, such as outstanding sections, hitsounds, or notable weaknesses. |

Judging scores will be **standardised** and submissions are **anonymous** to judges.

## Prizes

The prizes are split by [song category](#songs), meaning mappers compete in one of two leaderboards. The prizes for both are as follows:

| # | Prizes |
| :-: | :-- |
| 1st | 6 months of osu!supporter, $50 USD, *NPC 2025* profile badge (pending) |
| 2nd | 6 months of osu!supporter |
| 3rd | 4 months of osu!supporter |
