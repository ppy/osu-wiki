This contest was [announced back in October](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-30-fall-time-mania-mapping-contest) as a predecesor to its close seasonal partner, [STMI](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2050785?n=1). The aim was to give mappers a nice holiday session and win some goodies along with it. There was a very simple gimmick so as to not deter the mappers too much from entering by constraints of mapping style.

Anyway, 79 maps later, we're going straight to the point and have prepared a very a rather small and *humble* results showcase video: enjoy!
