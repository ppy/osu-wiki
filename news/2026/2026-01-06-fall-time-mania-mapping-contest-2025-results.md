After the season ends, the chill winds come, it signifies the wrap up of season as well as this contest! The very anticipated results are now live and with it we have prepared a little surprise with it, come join!

This contest was [announced back in October](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-30-fall-time-mania-mapping-contest) as a predecesor to its close seasonal partner, [STMI](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2050785?n=1). This content aimed to give mappers a nice holiday session and win some goodies along with it. The contest featured a very simple gimmick to not deter the mappers much of entering the contest and probably making them have to adapt their final product by the end of it.

Without furtherado, we have prepared a very a rather small and *humble* showcase video straight to the point; enjoy!

Special thanks to all the judges Maxus, Akasha-, Monoseul, Rurvker and Kaito-kun. Without them, this contest would not have been possible without them. And one extra shoutout to the people working behind the scenes also making this contest possible, RandomeLoL, Hivie and Walavouchey.
