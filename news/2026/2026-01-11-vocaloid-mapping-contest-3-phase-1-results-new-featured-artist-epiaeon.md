We've all been waiting for the results of the first phase of the Vocaloid Mapping Contest, and they're finally here!

![]()

Just in case you missed it, the Vocaloid Mapping Contest is a [two-phase contest that started in September](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-05-vocaloid-mapping-contest-3) to highlight two new Featured Artists.

This whole contest is themed around twos. Just like Hatsune Miku and Kasane Teto have paired up in the past year, two mappers teamed up and picked one song from each of the two artists (**mimizu** and **MARETU**). This phase was divided into two rounds, the PARALLEL and SWAP rounds:

In the **PARALLEL** round, one mapper created a beatmap for **mimizu**, and the other created a beatmap for **MARETU**. 

In the **SWAP** round, the mapper who created a beatmap for **mimizu** now created one for the **MARETU** song that their teammate had mapped in the previous round, and vice versa. However, this came with a significant limitation: their interpretation and approach to mapping the song had to be unique. The more similar the two difficulties of the same song were, the more they would be penalised by the judging panel! 

The top 6 of each round will progress onto the final stage, which will be expanded on below.

This highly experimental limitation forced mappers to think outside the box and create cohesive, interesting maps, without stepping on each other's approach to mapping the song. If mapper A chose to map the obvious approach, mapper B was incentivised to choose something less obvious! 

Let's see how they did! And if you're only here for the epic new Featured Artist, you scroll to the bottom.

## Phase 1 results

After 4 weeks of judging, here are your finalists of each game mode! In a huge surprise, osu!taiko actually had the most valid entries of any game mode. 

Note: "Team Names" are the name of the first anonymised mapper as seen in the list below. The order of the anonymised names corresponds to the revealed mapper name.

### Livestream showcase

Today, on January 11, we hosted a Twitch livestream to showcase all of the maps of the contest, with judge commentary for much of it! If you missed it, you can watch the full VOD below, featuring commentary from the judges and host!

## VMC3 phase 2: DUET

If you were listed above... congratulations! You have progressed to *phase 2*!

You and your teammate are now tasked with creating a full, rankable spread for our third (and final) brand-new Featured Artist: **[ePiaeon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/519)**! **ePiaeon** gave us early insight to his most recent song, *FLOP ERA*, for use within this contest. Many may already know of it, as it blew up in popularity!

Your submission will need to include a full spread for *FLOP ERA*. Specifically, the submission must include...
 - **osu!:** 4 difficulties in total (Normal, Hard, Insane and Extra)
 - **osu!taiko:** 3 difficulties in total (Muzukashii, Oni and Inner Oni)
 - **osu!catch:** 3 difficulties in total (Platter, Rain, Overdose or provide a proper spread containing at least 3 difficulties)
 - **osu!mania**: 3 difficulties in total (where each key mode and play style must either include a difficulty at Hard or lower, or provide a proper spread containing at least 3 difficulties)

All difficulties must be 100% collaborative. Contributions to each difficulty should be approximately evenly split 50/50. Difficulties in excess of the required spread as seen above are not permitted. Any excessive spread gaps created as a result of this can be ignored, so as to not restrict the mapping of higher difficulties.

## New Featured Artist: ePiaeon

If you were to come up with a list of the most standout new VOCALOID producers of 2025, ePiaeon would certainly come to mind, thanks to his most recent song, *FLOP ERA*, absolutely topping the VOCALOID music charts at the end of 2025.

A composer of dreamy tunes that hails from Indonesia, ePiaeon is a relatively newer VOCALOID producer, having released their first song that featured a vocal synthesizer, *A r g o T r a i n*, in 2023. Since then, they've released a variety of songs showcasing their ability to tune nearly any vocal synthesizer, from known ones like Hatsune Miku, to ***completely unheard*** of ones like Kasane Teto!

Check out all **4** of the available tracks on [**ePiaeon**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/519), each pre-timed to help you start mapping right away (especially useful if you're one of the above VMC3 contestants!)
