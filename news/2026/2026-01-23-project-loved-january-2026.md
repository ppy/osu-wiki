Happy Project Loved New Year, 2026!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Another year has passed, Loved fans! Did you know that our 2025 resolution has been to fill you in about what it is that we do? If we somehow didn't achieve that last year, there's always this year, so here's the run-down: Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll. Alternatively you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

If you ever wanted to get into the nitty gritty, luck is on your side, because you can contribute to Loved too! Feel like you've got the next big map for the Loved category? Send us your suggestions on the [website](https://loved.sh/) to spread some love.

Also, the osu! captains are looking for your thoughts on their proposal on how to handle picks going forward! This will affect the maps going up for voting in 2026, so please give it a read and let them know what you think about their suggestions, and even make your own! Find it [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2172855?n=1).

This is a full spread ranging from 2★ all the way to 7★, where most difficulties are jump aim oriented — something a vast part of the community will enjoy!

The 2nd *Popular Playcount* map of this month is [EXODIA - 666](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2158411#osu). It is mapped by our fellow Foreground Eclipse mapper [Seni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4830261) with a bunch of guest difficulties, creating a fun and proper spread between each difficulty!

This mapset can be described as a heavy jump challenge; something that most difficulties have in common is how fun the patterns are for the vast majority of players. Hence why this mapset is so popular!!

I hope you enjoy this map because I believe seeing top players compete in the leaderboard is something people would like to see as well!

What do you mean 2011 was 15 years ago!?? Well, I guess this year's first *Outstanding Oldies* may even be older than some of our players...

A collab between the "hall of fame" Chinese mappers [kiddly](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/74937), [rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/227717), and [tsuka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/106767), [jubeat Boss Stages Compilation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/37558#osu/120706) is a true hidden gem. If you've been playing rhythm games for a bit, you may recognise what's included in this package. This marathon consists of the songs *Evans* by DJ YOSHITAKA, *AIR RAID FROM THA UNDAGROUND* by GUHROOVY, *concon* by S-C-U, and *Heavenly moon* by Tatsh.

With all these nostalgic songs and geometric patterns, this map makes you feel like you've travelled back 14 years to when [Airman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/24313) was the newest hot thing (not that I would know since I only joined in 2017). Anyways, be prepared for 7 minutes of good 'ol well-structured CS 5 gaming by some of the best mappers China has brought us.

If you love old maps and rhythm games, let's take a trip down memory lane and vote yes!

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick, we are revisiting an iconic song, [Shibayan feat. yana - Fall in the Dark](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/696524), to mark this fresh 2026 start.

You may be familiar with this song from the [famous Ranked set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1531566), but this map was created much earlier by the classic alt-mapping duo [Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923) and [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009), who always deliver bangers and never disappoint.

With 10 minutes of masterclass elevated by yana's singing, this map is perfect for taking a break from gimmicky patterns and immersing yourself in a beautiful, yet challenging experience.

1, 2, 3, time to vote yes! (or else you will fall in the dark)

FIRE!!!

The pick this month for the *Daredevil Difficulties* category is [Dynamite (Camellia's MACHO TNT REMIX)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/838642#osu/2044485) mapped by [Foxy Grandpa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5580983) — an EXPLOSIVE test of pure mechanical and technical skill, clocking in at 222 BPM and a fierce 8.82★. It throws players into relentless tech patterns, insane cut streams, and brutal finger-control sequences that demand consistency at the highest level throughout the entire map.

Famous for [Vaxei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4787150)'s legendary score, it quickly became one of the most hyped and iconic challenges of its time, and still remains a benchmark for the highest-level players today. Even now, it stands as a true trial for those looking to push their limits. If you're searching for a map that separates the good from the absolute best, this is exactly what you're looking for! Time to prove whether you've got what it takes! ;)

MAKE SURE TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO VOTE YES!!!!!

\[!\]TOUHOU ALERT\[!\]

Happy New Year! We are very excited to bring you this month's *Ranked Rejects* pick, [Aki - Darkish](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/514965#osu/1093636) mapped by [Lortus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1008962).

This mapset was intended to achieve Ranked status as early as 2016, but due to various reasons, it was ultimately unsuccessful. However, throughout these 10 years, the osu! community has continued to show immense support for the mapset. Along with the amazing song, this mapset is etched in many osu! player's memory as one of the greats of the Jump/Stream hybrid map category.

This song is actually composed by one of osu!'s many [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists), [A-One](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/168)), who is well known in the osu! community for composing many popular and beloved Touhou Eurobeat songs. Please check them out!

Don't forget to vote yes if you love Touhou... and also vote yes so we can show some love that this mapset deserves and get this masterpiece in Loved!

To begin the year for our biggest curveball category in Project Loved, *Gameplay Gimmicks*, we have a joint osu! and osu!mania set nominated this month on the very glitchy track: [Kakka - Alfheim (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/941878#osu).

Both difficulties for each mode on this set feature a distinctly unique teleportation gimmick, through BPM and slider manipulation, something akin to a broken record. [Quag](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6535093) is responsible for the osu! difficulty, which sits at an UNPRECEDENTED 2.57★...

This map is perfect for players looking for a challenge with quite literally no mechanical difficulty, as you'll need to bring high levels of memorization and slider tracing skills to compete on this map, despite the star rating's kind appearance. Please check this out if this interests you! You can also check out [Tidek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/743282)'s osu!mania difficulty that brings a completely new spin on the teleportation gimmick.

Popularised by tons and tons of Twitter edits flooding everyone's timelines, Willy William has become one of the most recognisable faces within the modern years of osu! social media.

The map itself clocks in at a very high 8.88★ rating, featuring difficult cross-screen aim patterns for nearly 4 minutes, better make sure you get your aim hand warm and your keypad mashing on its own to make it through this one!

For January's second *Wildcard* pick, [Mijn Aim Zuigt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4587487) makes a reappearance to Project Loved with a classic of theirs: [telemist - peanut butter jelly time 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1372046#osu)!

This wonderful song has had its fair share of appearances ranging from cropping up in multiplayer lobbies over the years to (funnily enough) tournaments!, notably as a HR2 pick for [Corsace Closed 2024](https://liquipedia.net/osu/Corsace/Closed/2024)'s Grand Finals stage, and for good reason.

This map serves as a brutal benchmark for aim control as it greets you with numerous snap aim sections that even the best of players could slip up on. The circle size of this map, clocking in at 5.6, also proves to be a major hinderance for many to combo as the demand for consistency on the kiais are typically more than most maps around the same star rating. Despite the difficulty, there is nothing more liberating than clicking circles to some unfiltered raw tunes — which is exactly what Mijn Aim Zuigt offers.

Whether you're a tournament connoisseur or a spectator who stays for the music, be sure to show your support for this fabulous map by voting yes this month!

*description written by [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929)*

For our third and final *Wildcard* pick of the month, we start our new year with something utterly breathtaking!

As a lot of beatmap descriptions will say, [Chicago Symphony Orchestra - Rhapsody in Blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2272633#osu/4841179) from [Woey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3792472) is best experienced with video at least once. The map serves to capture the "ebb and flow" and "ups and downs" of the entire 12-minute extravaganza orchestral piece and accompanying animation from *Fantasia 2000*. A wealth of huge, sweeping sliders, as well as multiple instances of patterns and sections directly mapped to the video itself, await your arrival!

Despite how harsh the map appears on the surface, I can promise you this 10★ map is bound to leave an impression on you in some manner. I would implore you to read the beatmap description if you want to learn how and why this particular map was created, as it encapsulates the amount of effort and love that went into this heartfelt tribute for a loved one.

Want to embark on the journey of a lifetime? Vote yes!

[naari3 - Ronarudo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1632762#taiko/3332820), created by [Zetera](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/587737) — a legendary mapper also known as a Medal Hunter — is an extremely difficult tech map used as the Grand Finals NM2 of [Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2021).

At first glance, it appears to be just a simple meme map, but playing it well demands extremely high skill in areas such as reading, stamina, and reflexes. Concentration must never waver for even a moment during the two minutes, as snaps change frequently within the map. It is so challenging and intricate that once you make a mistake, it becomes extremely difficult to regain your rhythm and play effectively.

Even top players find this map extremely challenging to master. Vote "Yes" now and compete against the world's best players for a spot on the global leaderboard!

It tested consistency as a NM1, pushed the limits of how challenging a HR2 could be and decided the winner of matches as a nerve-wracking tiebreaker. No matter the situation or the mod you decide to use, this map is always a blast to play!

Vote "Yes!" if you want to see this Loved, if you're unsure about your choice just give it a try, trust me... d\[-\_-\]b

300 BPM, 2:13 | 7.99★, 9.09★\
*description written by [K a y o k o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17664300)*

When it comes to raw speed at the highest level, few names carry as much weight as [Seren58](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15252950), a legendary player whose understanding of taiko translates just as cleanly into his mapping. [Seishun Complex (Kirairi Bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1901991#taiko) is a perfect showcase of that expertise.

Clocking in at an astounding 300 BPM, this set offers two different experiences. The lower difficulty is a no-nonsense pure speed map, demanding consistency and control from start to finish, whereas the top difficulty evolves into a full-on speed stream challenge, pushing stamina and execution in a way that only a couple handful of players can truly handle.

Its competitive pedigree speaks for itself. The Quartet difficulty has appeared as the Grand Finals NM3 in [Onitou Taiko Cup #1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1783745?n=1) and again as the Finals NM3 in [osu!taiko World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024). This is the kind of map built not just to be played, but to decide matches.

If high-tempo precision and tournament-grade speed are what you're after, this map delivers exactly that. Give it a run, and if you want to see this speed demon earn its place in Loved, make sure to vote "Yes!"

The difficulty name "Flow" is perhaps quite apt for [Megafan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6632605)'s [Street - Maritime Police](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2159322#taiko). Having been custom mapped for [TWC 2024 Quarterfinals DT1](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024#quarterfinals), the map hosts multiple patterns and rhythms to push the accuracy skillset to the max, including even note patterning, slow slider velocity, and most notably several patterns combining 1/4, 1/3, 1/6 and 1/8 rhythms.

Besides DT, this map can also be enjoyed in a variety of other flavours for those of us of a lesser pedigree, including slow HD, speed-tech HR, or even just plain NM. So if you're up for the challenge and want to see a leaderboard on this groovy map, remember to vote "Yes"!

To end this month's picks, we've decided to choose a map that'll make you feel like you're back in the '90s!

[Nirvana](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1972185#taiko) is a double BPM style map by none other than [layxa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14800030). If you know anything about layxa maps, you know that they love combining 1/3 and 1/4 at high BPMs, and this map is no exception. Since its upload, the map has garnered about 1,000 plays and on top of being already mapped really cleanly, it plays like butter!

A note for my fellow bongo players: don't mess up the 11 note kat mono before each kiai :D

Whether you're a 350 BPM enjoyer or a house music enthusiast, get ready for an absolute banger of a map and be sure to vote "Yes" while you're at it ;)

190 BPM, 4:43 | 4.20★, 5.67★\
*description written by [LaviSorrow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9966768)*

[Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312) is a French mapper whose mapping style was truly ahead of its time. Well known within the community, they delivered many impressive beatmaps, and the one we are nominating today is their last creation.

Dating back to 2018, this unfinished mapset consists of the *Legende* (Overdose) and *Rain* difficulties. When looking at the patterns, it is surprising to realise just how old this map really is. Visionary mapping and clean construction make this map stand out, while also highlighting the enduring legacy of one of the finest osu!catch mappers of that era.

As a matter of fact, [Kyuare's last map to enter Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/542478#fruits/1149965) was added exactly two years ago as of today's news post.

To honor Kyuare and everything they have contributed to osu!catch mapping, we nominate this beatmap as a gesture of gratitude and respect.

172 BPM, 2:16 | 5.00★\
*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

With [Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962), another familiar name to the Loved section makes an appearance once again. This time with a map in a style that is very similar to some of his other already Loved maps.

Of course I am talking about the maps [Kagayaku Hari no Kobitozoku ~ Little Princess](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/801435#fruits/1682267), Loved in 2021, and [Rakujitsu ni Haeru Sakasa-jou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1478454#fruits/3033148), Loved in 2023. The difference is, that the map up for voting this round is significantly more accessible. While his previous two maps of that style are aimed at a highly skilled audience, this one is made with a broader audience in mind. It is way shorter and has easier patterns overall. The accuracy you need in your movements is less severe and allows for more leeway. But the skillset needed is still the same: good catcher control and reading, for the most part. The lack of hyperdashes makes sure you need to be extra precise with your movements else you will easily miss.

If you ever thought those other maps were too hard, then we have a good middle ground here between too easy and too hard. I can see a lot of people being able to FC this, even with mods. And maybe one or the other alien is crazy enough to use DT, which would be the real challenge. I think this map brings enjoyment for every skill level, which makes it a suitable pick. Make sure to give it a try!

*description written by [Realmaas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640)*

To round up this month's osu!catch picks, it's time to welcome back a name the Loved section hasn't seen in a while. With his last Loved map, [GHOST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/738141#fruits/1557674), dating back from 2018, [Setomi79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2205929) is back, and with an even crazier entry this time around.

[Icyxis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2352332#fruits/5063059), as you will understand from watching even its first few seconds, is an endgame-level challenge. Having gained some notoriety thanks to some mind-blowing plays from [Motion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3885626/fruits) and [ArMa79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4982799/fruits), this map follows the recent trend of pushing the limits of speed in the gamemode further and further. At a BPM of 222, the continuous onslaught of antiflows, stairs, cross-screen jumps, and wiggles is enough to gatekeep even the very best players in the world from playing the map properly. On top of that, many of the patterns found throughout the map are rather unconventional, which is unusual for a speed-focused map. This adds a massive control requirement, *as if the speed wasn't enough*.

With how much better players have gotten at endgame maps, it is time to add one more to the Loved section. And this one could very well be one of the hardest it has ever seen. Vote yes for [Icyxis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2352332#fruits/5063059)!

This is going to be a one-of-a-kind SV entry for this month: a joint osu! and osu!mania set of a pretty unique song by itself: *Alfheim*.

Featured in [MWC 2020 Semifinals](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2020_4K#semifinals), [Tidek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/743282)'s *Alfheim* caught off-guard many players at the time. The abrupt 0 BPM stops, combined with the erratic and unpredictable nature of the song itself, made this tournament pick an especially risky one, marking this map as one of the most infamous MWC SV entries of all time.

The amount of memorization and learning that *Alfheim* requires cannot be understated: Semifinals SVs were really terrifying back in 2020. The way the variations settle in (especially towards the later half of the song) require internalizing the song itself as an anchor, because the map itself is not going to help you! The end result, once mastered, is a very flashy, literally start-and-stop, showcase of madness and insanity... but I suppose high-level SV players are already used to those shenanigans.

I cannot speak for the osu! side of things, but [Quag](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6535093)'s description tells us that Tidek's interpretation was the inspiration for their work, which is incidentally why Tidek is hosting this double-mode set. Do you want to see one of the most unique multi-mode Loved sets happen? Bring your vote to the table!

Wake up, it's time for the yearly [Tunnelblick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7737096) special!

If you've been aware of [Tunnelblick's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7737096) previous modchart Loved entry: [MAKE IT FUNKY NOW](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2085716), this is basically episode 0. *Pictured as Perfect* was [Tunnelblick's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7737096) first [notosu!](https://notosu.sh/) submission, taking the storyboarding world off guard in transcribing the NotITG modchart spirit in faithfulness and polish that we rarely had seen before.

Frums' *Pictured as Perfect* as a song is a journey packed in two and a half minutes. The modchart carries this journey through distinct sections and gimmicks that, while very flashy at times, are quite intuitive once you get the hang of it. It does require learning to deal with both upscroll and downscroll reading in some capacity, but it's not a bad skill to learn, especially if you wanna learn Dance Dance Revolution or similar games eventually. Or perhaps even actual NotITG modcharts?

Support Tunnelblick's next endeavours by voting "Yes" for this entry in the thread!

[Various Artists - Jumpstream Practice Pack (JPP)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1655774#mania) by [Ventilo le vrai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13661408)\

The \[Marathon (delete after download)\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

As the title of the set suggests, this is a great way to practice your jumpstream ability as a beginner. [Ventilo le vrai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13661408)'s pack certainly gives a great way for players to start their journey in getting better at the skillset, as jumpstreams are one of the most fundamental patterns that a player needs to learn.

In osu!mania terms, this pack contains charts ranging from 1st Dan up to 6th Dan, which caters to beginner-level players. At this level, players are still trying to grasp how to differentiate single notes from jumps at a fast rate. As such, these charts are not the densest, meaning these maps do not contain difficult trills and repetitive jumps. However, by the time you reach the higher difficulty charts such as [Bookmaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1655774#mania/3379792) and [Volcanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1655774#mania/3379809), the patterning will start to get more complex, really pushing players at this level to the limit.

Jumpstreams in this pack range from 125 BPM to 191 BPM, giving players a modest chance to learn how to read proper jumpstream charts. Overall, this is a great pack, especially if you are still dipping your toes into the skillset, and players are able to gain proficiency in reading, accuracy, and stamina.

I'd say [Ventilo le vrai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13661408) was very successful in creating something that can help a lot of newcomers get better in jumpstream, and hopefully also increase their versatility in other skillsets. If you think so as well, then it's time to vote 'Yes' and provide this map with Loved status, and see how other players perform in these kinds of charts!

[MURDER IN MY MIND](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1867638#mania/3841902) will be this month's chordjack pick, and with the amount of plays this has gotten, it's certainly gained a lot of traction in the 4K playerbase. [Smokydoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20169884) has made quite a lot of charts already, especially testing skill sets in the Rice department, such as chordjack.

What makes this chart a great pick for players to train their chordjack ability is how there is an importance of reading, stamina, and speed altogether. If you aren't paying attention to the chart very well, you could easily slip up and drop a lot of 50s, and also get exhausted due to the amount of effort it takes to play these at a consistent rate.

For beginners who are yet to grasp the chordjack density skill set, this is an amazing chart to start with, especially with a BPM of 120 for the base rate. Knowing how advanced the playerbase is, rates up to 1.45 are also present for this chart, and surely some Double Time scores will be present on lower rates.

Let's all support [Smokydoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20169884) and give them another chart in the Loved category by giving them your vote!

[cosmovibe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7796360) might not be a familiar name, especially since their nomination this month, [Crafted In Ice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1924580#mania/3973283), is their only upload, but you can rest easy knowing this undoubtedly has the quality to back it up.

Perhaps the best place to start would be to point out that *cosmovibe*'s charting history dates pretty far back, with most of their charts being on Etterna, namely this one in particular appearing in [Mina Megapack 6](https://etternaonline.com/packs/3827), under no credit for some reason.

This initially made its way onto osu! after being uploaded by request for [4DM2023](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2023)'s Round of 16 map pool, but continued to grow in popularity due to the immense quality it holds. Surprisingly, the approach is rather simple, staying faithful to what the song represents itself as, yet the song itself is what *really* lets these patterns shine through.

Some sections mostly consist of 1/4 notes with the occasional minijack, some sections are heavier on jacks with more 1/3 note usage, and of course, there are many bursts and techy patterns dispersed throughout, allowing for an experience that feels very, very satisfying. Perhaps the best of all is that this chart ends up on the lower difficulty spectrum of tech charts, meaning if you've been playing for some time, you can probably play this! As usual, there are uprates for those who wish to challenge themselves even further.

As stated, regardless of how good you are, it's worth giving this a play! While you're at it, why not give it your vote as well?

**Hallelujah!**

[Ukulele](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1823120#mania/3740929) is quite an interesting chart overall, and this has been featured in quite a few tournaments. With the abundance of difficult LN charts getting Loved recently, getting onto the easier end might be a great change of pace for a lot of players.

Being only at 104 BPM, your patience and control will definitely be tested a lot here. What makes this chart interesting is how the coordination, release, and density parts are charted, giving you a lot of diverse Long Note skillsets to be tested. It's no surprise that this chart would be used as a way for players to be given a sort of "LN skill check" to see how proficient they can really be, despite all of the patterns that can be thrown at them.

In this chart, the release parts are seen mainly at the start, where you are introduced to the nature of this song. As it starts to get livelier, though, density and coordination start to become more prominent, in which we see the presence of minijacks mixed with LNs, and also some full LN parts thrown into the bag as well.

Overall, this chart has a lot to offer as a test for your overall LN stability, and [Miyuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9244967) has certainly done a great job of being able to express different skillsets in one chart. If you think so as well, then maybe we should all give this a positive vote!

It's been half a year since we nominated any anti-meta keymode sets. This time, we're bringing these nice 6K packs into the voting here! The difficulty of this set ranges from \[15\] to \[21\]. If you have gained certain skills in 6K, you could have a chance of playing it. The hardest difficulty would not require you to be a world top player. Accordingly, it is a mid-skilled range set. This pack is a collab map created by 2 decent and experienced 6K mappers, [HMillion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12891443) and [[Crz]sunnyxxy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10333739). These 2 mappers have mapped rice, hybrid, and LN. All of which are contained in this pack.

Vote for this map if you're a 6K fan! We're also glad that this would be another anti-meta keymode party!

We have the rare collaboration between [Lung_P](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271308) and [Flexo123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5367287), both are extremely talented mappers with plenty of experience charting various LN patterns as their main speciality!

For this opportunity, we want to present [Rejection - Signal (feat. SUCH)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1531894#mania/3133039) which is a popular chart that gained a high standing amongst the community. Both the 4K and 7K difficulties feature mainly dense LN patterns with several mixtures of patterns that test your accuracy and physicality to hit them properly. If you don't hit them carefully and with precision, you will find yourself struggling to maintain high accuracy!

We are honored to present this chart to start 2026 with new energy and new life! If you love our pick, don't hesitate to show your support by voting positively for this map!
