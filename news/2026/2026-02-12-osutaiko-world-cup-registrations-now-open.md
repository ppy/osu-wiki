The osu!taiko World Cup 2026 is back with a slew of changes.

![](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2026/img/twc2026-banner.jpg)

Taking a page out of the [2025 osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025#group-stage-instructions)'s book, the tournament will feature a group stage in place of the traditional Round of 32, with the top 8 seeds from the Qualifier stage receiving a bye to the Round of 16. The minimum team size has also been lowered to 2 players, allowing for more countries to field a roster.

## Format changes

While we'll be keeping the same overall tournament structure, with Qualifiers seeding into a bracket, there are a few changes to the format that we want to highlight:

- For the top 8 qualified teams (**Legends**), the tournament will begin on the winners bracket of the Round of 16 weekend
- For the 24 remaining teams (**Challengers**), the tournament will begin with a group stage, where they will be split into 8 groups of 3 teams each. The top team from each group will advance to the Round of 16 winners bracket, while the second and third place teams will be placed in the Round of 16 losers bracket instead.



As always, for more details pertaining to the tournament, refer to the **[osu!taiko World Cup 2026 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2026)**. You can also discuss this event in the **[official discussion thread]({DISC_THREAD})** or the public **[community server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H)**.
