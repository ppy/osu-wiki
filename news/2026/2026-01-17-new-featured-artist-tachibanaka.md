osu! mappers know how to make osu! music.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/520/header.jpg)

**tachibanaka** is no stranger to osu!. Better known in the community as [Tachibana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13069714), a circle clicker and mapper quickly approaching the status of [Centurion](/wiki/People/Centurions) with 78 Ranked maps and counting, **tachibanaka** launched their music career in a way you could've easily guessed: by listening to music through the osu!editor. 

Influenced by the likes of *DVRST*, *ANGUISH*, and [*Shadren*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/362) (another musician + mapper combo!), **tachibanaka** has taken a liking to variety by producing a multitude of electronic genres. As someone well versed in osu!'s map catalogue, he hopes to bring more genres to the osu! sphere, such as *phonk*, which you'll discover to be the backbone of some of his music!

Let's cut to the good stuff. A grand total of **17** new tracks are forever living on [**tachibanaka**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/520), pre-timed by us and post-mapped by you.

Experience **tachibanaka**'s music for yourself:
