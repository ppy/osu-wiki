You may have noticed the festive Christmas backgrounds, rotated on the title screen in the lead up to Christmas (from December 22 ~ 31) - but now it's finally time to reveal the results of Fanart Contest \#5 voting.

We received a total of 132,988 votes from 22,213 users over two weeks. 8 osu! staff members took part in the staff voting (including peppy, of course!). This time, we're announcing 10 winners who will each win a four month supporter tag: five winners selected by the public poll, five selected by osu! staff. First place wins an osu! tablet too!

As always, we've included some honorable mentions at the end. These artists don't win prizes this time, but deserve to be included here anyway. They are selected based on a mix of staff votes and public poll results too.

We'll be granting the supporter tags and contacting the first prize winner about the physical prize in the next few days.

**Update (11/1):** It has been brought to our attention that the entry awarded third place by public poll was in violation of the contest rules ("Everything in your image must be your own work! Don't steal anyone's art, and please don't "trace" anything either. Make your own pose"). As such, this entry has been disqualified and the 4-month supporter tag has been revoked.

The winners are...
