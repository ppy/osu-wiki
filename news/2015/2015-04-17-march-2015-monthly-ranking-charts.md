The Ranking Charts for March 2015 have just been released and [can be found here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1503)! Along with that, we updated the Spring Season of the [Ranking Charts long-term leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgaKVJj_MDo0PwGrGXbKRVzjE9fhOUb4XZXRsOjTaoQ/pubhtml)! This month [Kyshiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/640611), [\_Gezo\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/481582), [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) and [Fullerene-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2531335) picked the maps for the Monthly Ranking Charts.

## Ranking Charts Creation

The charts have previously been created by letting four dedicated community members select the most noteworthy maps of this month. We also reward the top beatmap in each category by providing **1 month of supporter status** to the mapper.

## osu!

For osu!, we decided to let **[Kyshiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/640611)** pick their favourite maps.

- **[t\+pazolite - cheatreal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/88180) by [caren\_sk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/542498)**

Do I really have to explain myself? This map has been around for quite a while now, so many people (including me) already liked this before it got ranked and it only got better. caren\_sk's extra is fun to play, his style is just great for playing that's no secret. Then we have RLC's Extra, again, do you need explaination? This difficulty plays great and it looks great (I like it a bit more than caren\_sk's extra but, shh!). Then there's the lower diffs, which again are good and polished. All in all a great map which will be remembered.

- [Venetian Snares - Integraation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/280089) by [fergas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3144542)

Yes! This is exactly how you map breakcore. I also like the creative slider at the slow parts. The spacing is done correctly, making it rather simple to follow, yet making it hard due to the density of the objects. Breakcore can be a pain to map due to the weird rhythms every now and then, however when mapped correctly, it plays smooth like this. Also a simple, yet nice storyboard, which changes color according to the feeling of the song.

- [U1 overground - Dopamine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210316) by [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699)

Watching this extra difficulty go by was quite the experience, but god that is a cool looking difficulty. I'd suggest the players who can't play this to at least give it a look with the auto mod. But hey, there's also the lower difficulties, which also look great and play cool and are probably more playable for most people.

- [Memme - Chinese Restaurant](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/256467) by [M o k o r i](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3650145)

This felt quite unique and cool to play. I like the way the kick sliders in the Spicy difficulty are used. You can see there's been put thought into the placement of objects, making it look clean as well. As for the guest Insane, it has the same feeling to it, it plays cool and looks nice. The lower difficulties are again the same kind of style, but simplified.

- [Gavin G - Desire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/242549) by [Asphyxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715720)

Bet you've heard of Asphyxia recently, mapping great extra difficulties, making them look good and cool to play. The extra difficulty has a nice flow going on as well as following the music accordingly, can't think of a better way to map drum and bass. The wide amount of difficulties to this mapset make for a great spread and makes it enjoyable for every kind of player, from new players to top tier players.

- [senya - Akatsuki no Suiheisen ni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/242360) by [Satellite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1661227)

All the difficulties here look polished and are fun to play. Yet again a wide spread to fill the needs of every standard player. The high difficulties, mostly the extra, follows the music pretty good, having jumps where there's strong beats, streams where there should be streams and contains cool hitsounds.

## Taiko

For Taiko, we asked **[\_Gezo\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/481582)** about their favourite maps in March 2015.

- **[Mohican Sandbag - U.N.Owen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/177908) by [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128)**

Looking at how long the map is, some people would turn down the map despite its catchy tune. However this is greatly mapped and the map is just one of the most accurate depictions of what the song is really, yet OnosakiHito's own touch is still present in the map in itself. A tricky yet simple map which is really worth the play, and the 7 minutes; and probably my personal favourite of the month.

- [Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas - Rave-Up Tonight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/244532) by [qoot8123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766371)

There's it. One of the best maps I have found for the month. I personally like the way each note was placed, as well as the hitsounds associated with it; and doesn't get boring at all despite most patterns being very simple when put alone.

- [Dan Winter - Don't Stop Push It Now (Nightcore Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/200374) by [Gero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1467715) & [Hanjamon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1703330)

To me one of the most fun Nightcore maps I have ever played. The map is extremely dense but it doesn't cut out the chills I get while playing it over and over. It's overall a well-constructed map which is strongly oriented towards a simple structure but twisted so it flows well with the melody, the lyrics or even the background noises you may hear. Almost one full thousand notes of fun, to sum it up.

- [RYO - Shuffle Heaven](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/194109) by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)

A difficult map I like due to how challenging it is for the higher players, but doesn't cut out the fun for the less experienced ones. For instance, in WereOni, the longer streams are thought to some extent, flow well and are in concordance with the rest of the pattern. It is also a map that was featured in the Taiko World Cup!

- [µ's - KiRa-KiRa Sensation!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/204428) by [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419) & [ts8zs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/838176)

A lovely map with fairly simple patterns which still reflect properly the song. The intense feel of the song is well translated through the patterns without going for complete overmap and big notes give a nicer plus in calmer parts when there's a clash between the calmer part and the two-beats intensity increase.

- [Hatsuki Yura - Yoiyami Hanabi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/236568) by [mrdumpling64](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2478693) & [aabc271](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/155707)

Calm difficulties for a calm song, that's what the motto of this map should be to me. Every note fits well to what they are mapped to, and the speed change at end makes the feel in intensity more perceptible to the player.

## Catch the Beat

For Catch the Beat, **[alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114)** was the chosen one to declare the winners of the March 2015 beatmaps.

- **[Kugimiya Rie & Kitamura Eri - Holy Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/227585) by [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933)**

A nice CtB map in this month for sure. The patterns in overall are not repetitive, the jumps in various difficulties are following the rhythm of such calm yet rhythmical music, which impresses me a lot. The map also takes care of newcomers with an array of beginner difficulties.

- [U1 overground - Dopamine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210316) by [fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699)

The song is quite impressive as it is a kind of Dubstep music, the jumps and patterns in the hardest difficulty pretty well suits the music. I am pretty sure that you will be tapping your feet as you are following the music. How I describe this map is, challenging and fun.

- [AiRI - Prismic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/247745) by [Kowaii_ne](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2213794)

A map that takes care of beginner players with an even difficulty spread. Beginner players can advance their ways past different difficulties. Also the hitsounding in this map works well with some drumming patterns. I do recommend beginner players trying this map.

- [Yuyoyuppe - AiAe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/257793) by [Fort](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2805457)

This map fulfils the drum lovers like me since the patterns and hitsounds match the drumming sounds and the vocals cleverly. More than that, the difficulty spread is even that takes care about both beginners and top players. The stream patterns in the map also impress me and other players with the strong rhythms!

- [Ryu* - Sakura Mirage](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/205022) by [Priti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2198472)

The song is attractive and captivating. I loved the way how mapper emphasized the strong sound with jumps, they are really enjoyable to play with. Have fun with this map! Although the map isn't specifically made for CtB, it's genuinely fun to play with!

- [Dan Winter - Don't Stop Push It Now (Nightcore Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/200374) by [Gero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1467715)

This map is pretty well-made from different perspectives. The hitsounds and storyboard play a great role in this map which are really outstanding. Better still, the jumps in different difficulties suit the rhythm of the music. You may play the map with storyboard and hitsounds for at least once!

## osu!mania

For osu!mania, **[Fullerene-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2531335)** was able to select their personal most noteworthy beatmap from last month.

- **[bbn - Identic Conflict](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/246853) by [pporse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4991434)**

Marathons are generally more difficult to map well, mainly because the length of the song requires that the map stay interesting enough to justify its duration. This map is a feast for the eyes, and for the fingers. Many diverse patterns are used here, from calm piano chords, to intense double note streams, and even some 1/8 grace notes. Long notes are also quite dense at times, but only used in certain sections to create a distinct emphasis to specific sounds. I was taken aback the first time I watched it play when it was first qualified, and I'm happy to see it ranked. This, to me, is unarguably the best ranked map of March and deserves to be in the Ranking Charts.

- [GReeeeN - Shinobi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/202755) by [ExUsagi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3027421)

Another map from ExUsagi, this time featuring both 4K and 7K difficulty spread. ExUsagi's style of heavy long note usage makes an appearance here, most notably in the "Insanity" difficulties for each respective key-mode. Also included is a difficulty with 0 long notes for both key-modes under the "Burst!" title, for those who prefer to play maps without long notes in them. This lets players with a preference for and against long notes to enjoy the same song.

- [ChouCho - My dear friend](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/165164) by [Reikosaka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1814885)

The highlight of this mapset for me was the 8K difficulty spread, mapped by dosyeru. It's not too often that a map outside 4K and 7K makes an entry intro the ranked map pool. This 8K difficulty spread was mapped as 7K+1, drawing parallels with the maps from beatmania IIDX. That's not to say Reikosaka's 7K difficulties aren't great in their own regard. SV usage, while tame in nature, is tastefully used and creates a variety of effects that all add to the experience. All difficulties also make use of keysounds, layering on top of the existing piano and violin notes. Playing this mapset was a nice change of pace from the more upbeat offerings that are seen often on osu!mania.

- [ZOGRAPHOS (Yu_Asahina+Yamajet) - Verse IV](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/264749) by [Ichigaki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2403444)

Interesting songs lead to interesting maps. The wildly shifting time signatures and musical phrases open up opportunities to make something unique. Ichigaki captured this well in my opinion, creating one of the hardest ranked 4K maps to this date. Containing plenty of ¼ jacks, long note patterns, and even a 1/6 stream at 212 BPM, (equivalent to a 318 BPM ¼ stream!) this map sets itself apart from others in both structure and sheer difficulty.

- [sakuzyo - AXION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/222073) by [ljqandylee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/141469)

ljqandylee returns with another 6 star map, including guest difficulties from ExPew and collaborations with Gao. The Ex-ray difficulty contains many complex long note patterns that will give any player a challenge, with Pew's Insane serving as the appetizer to the main course. I'm quite fond of how the calmer portions of the song are mapped, acting as breaks between the more intense portions of the maps. Some of the patterns in Ex-ray are a bit on the crazy side, but nothing that's enough to make me dislike it. One thing is for certain, this is definitely a map that can influence those to come in the future.

- [Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat. Hatsune Miku - Rubik's Cube](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/170446) by [Harbyter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1147679)

A well known map from osu!standard, Harbyter brings this song to osu!mania with a 4K mapset. Jacks and short bursts of long notes are the norm in this map, while not being overly rough on the wrists. Ene's SC is more focused on mapping the main phrases, while the Rubik's Cube difficulty challenges players with its progressively heavier layering. All of the difficulties have their own little quirks and mapping concepts, which puts it in my list of the most notable ranked osu!mania maps in March.

**The March 2015 ranking charts will end on the 15th May 2015**. For the next month, we will elect new community members to pick their favourite beatmaps, so stay tuned!
