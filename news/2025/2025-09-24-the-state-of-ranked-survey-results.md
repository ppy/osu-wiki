Vox populi, vox Dei.

First things first, we want to thank everyone who took the time to participate in the [survey back in June](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-06-25-survey-the-state-of-ranked). The gathered data has proven to be invaluable — not just to the Nomination Assessment Team, but the osu! team at large!

But first, let's put engagement into numbers. Here's a list with all (verified) participants per mode:

- **osu!:** 7,394
- **osu!taiko:** 623
- **osu!catch:** 437
- **osu!mania:** 1,972

## Results

The following graphs were made using the raw data obtained from the form responses. While we tried highlighting the most interesting trends throughout each question's answers, it is virtually impossible to cram all numbers into a single news post. Therefore, if anyone is curious enough and wants to dive deeper into the data, you can find the raw results in the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ImI8ErcmQLWFN2RcDRSZOcIIu4s696bJMX5LD2kh9wY/view?rm=minimal).

**Note:** All *percentages* in the *pie charts* relate to the results *across all game modes, combined*.

With that out of the way, let's take a deep dive into the results' highlights!

### The community's main drives

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-24-the-state-of-ranked-survey-results/pie-main-drive.png)

For many people in the team, this was one of the most important questions to be answered. osu! is built by and *for* the community. Therefore, it is really important we always try to meet most of the community's needs. While it is impossible to appeal to everyone, knowing what the community is most interested in is a very good start!

Unsurprisingly, a substantial amount of players — **22% of respondents** — are interested in the competitive environment that the Ranked section fosters through ranks and [Performance points](/wiki/Performance_points). Over the years, we have noticed this was always a point of friction between all parties involved in the Ranked section. What caught our attention was the fact that despite how vocal users are on the topic of pp, they're not the game's biggest stakeholders.

That crown goes to the people who play to discover maps they find enjoyable, with **28% of responses** siding with this idea. In addition to the **20% of people** who enjoy discovering new songs (or songs they're already fond of), most users like to play the game to... just have fun!

What took us by surprise is the rather low number of people interested in mapping or modding in the context of the Ranked section, with only **8% of all responses** expressing explicit interest on the topic. Breaking that down, the osu! mappers and modders make up the biggest percentage of their mode at 9% (632/7,398), osu!taiko at 3% (20/624), osu!catch at 6% (26/436) and osu!mania at 5% (90/1,972).

### Achieving goals

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-24-the-state-of-ranked-survey-results/bar-goals.png)

Knowing what people's goals are is just half of the equation, however. What's really important is whether these goals are being realised in a satisfactory manner. All in all, we can see that the number of satisfied users is split somewhat evenly between all modes. More notably, osu!catch has a fairly noticeable amount of users satisfied with meeting their goals as opposed to other modes!

Everyone else sits mostly around 7 or 8, especially in osu! as seen by the pink bars. Those two alone make up for **37% of all responders**. These results seem to suggest that Ranked has a purpose in many people's eyes. And while that currently does not seem to be the case for everyone, it's a good sign that we're on the right track — just not there yet!

### The quality of the section

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-24-the-state-of-ranked-survey-results/pie-quality.png)

Quality has always been a point of contention between users in the community. The fact that people interpret quality in different ways does not help, although that was to be expected of course. In the same way people find fun in different ways, so will their tastes differ!

With that said, we noticed there was quite the split in opinions between osu! and the rest of modes when asking such a question. While responses between osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania remained more or less balanced, osu! was the only mode with a disproportionate amount of players claiming that the section's quality has decreased over the past few years. Moreover, game modes other than osu! seemed to boast of a newer player base as many users claimed not to be keeping up with beatmaps from previous years.

Respondents active in osu!, however, seem to be more pessimistic with 2/3 of respondents either believing that the section's quality hasn't changed or that it has declined. osu!mania players remain the most optimistic, being the group with the highest percentage of people who think the Ranked section has improved, even if just a bit!

And speaking of quality...

### Quality enforcement

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-24-the-state-of-ranked-survey-results/pie-enforcement.png)

While the previous graph wasn't as clear-cut, users seemed to be more vocal about the current enforcement standards of the Ranked section. Almost half of responses — around **46%** — believe that quality should be enforced more thoroughly.

This is in stark contrast with previous community polls. While there was a vocal majority of people back then in opposition of the strict enforcement of quality over Ranked maps, the current trends seem to suggest that a course correction is in order if the numbers are to be trusted.

All in all, most users showed to be in favour of increasing quality enforcement throughout the Ranked section or just neutral towards it. Only **15% of responses** were against any increase in the current enforcement standards.

### Quality of newly ranked maps

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-24-the-state-of-ranked-survey-results/bar-quality.png)

While the distribution across all modes seem to be all above average, it is worth noting that osu! in particular has the least amount of players who are enjoying the quality of newly ranked maps. This is easily seen by the sharp decrease of votes between 8 and 10, while having a noticeable increase between 3 and 4 when comparing to other modes.

All in all, the reception of newly ranked maps is mostly positive all across the board, with most of the votes landing between 7 and 8, which together make up **42% of responses**. Currently, the only conclusion we can draw is that the feeling towards newly ranked maps is mostly positive, but not overwhelmingly so.

### Ranked map amount

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-24-the-state-of-ranked-survey-results/pie-influx.png)

Lastly, we got a lighter topic to cover: the amount of Ranked maps getting ranked every day. Following similar trends with the previous graphs, osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania players seem to be on the same page for the most part, with a substantial amount of users claiming that the number of Ranked maps is too low. If anything, they seem to be in favour of getting a higher number of maps, with osu!catch players taking the lead by quite the margin! Despite that, the majority of users across all modes remained neutral towards the question, not taking any sides.

osu! is yet again the outlier here. Being the only game mode where the [beatmap ranking queue](/wiki/beatmap_ranking_procedure/ranking_queue) is almost always full, when compared to other modes they had the highest percentage of users claiming that the amount of maps being ranked every day is too high, as well as the lowest percentage of people who thought the amount is too low.

However, the remaining 75% of players (of all game modes) either believe that the current amount of maps is of their liking (**26%**), or remain neutral to the amount of maps being ranked altogether (**49%**).

What caught our attention the most out of these numbers (particularly in osu!) was the difference between written opinions across different forum posts, comments, and discussions, and the poll's results. While there was a very vocal group of people who claimed that the high amount of maps being ranked was harming the Ranked section, most of the non-neutral responses indicate that the amount of maps is either good as is or too low.

## Glossing over the comments

Beyond the numerical results we've been able to extract from the survey, there have been a myriad of comments and opinions in the free-form questions of the survey that we believe are worth looking into. While the team will take a deeper look into these as we discuss future changes, we wanted to highlight a handful of comments coming from different groups of interest!

### The Nomination Assessment Team

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!</p>

*I think it'd be cooler if BNs personally curated what maps they nominated more, since that'd imply that ranked maps are the best of the best for each BN rather than some realistically undefinable quality metric. The mapping community already hates being restricted from nominating 100 maps every 3 months or whatever, so my desire is very unaligned there lol.*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-mania news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!mania</p>

*Hard to define quality. I do believe the name of the game here is variety. What one believes is of quality may not be the same as what another player may think. So long we have an influx of varied yet fun maps for a wide variety of songs, styles, and key modes, we should be golden.*

</div>

### Beatmap Nominators

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-taiko news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!taiko</p>

*We lack of everything. What we mostly lack are motivated community member wishing to learn modding. Most people motivated to mod, are the one that are motivated to become a BN. There's nothing wrong with that, but once that member fail a test or two, he most likely will stop modding.*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-fruits news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!catch</p>

*Given this is the smallest mode for overall mapping, BNs, NATs, and players all in one, it does come down to bringing in that right amount of quality for everyone. This could mean more eyes on qualified; a stronger push for players/mappers/modders to check qualified and mod issues.*

</div>

### Mappers

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-osu news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!</p>

*Might be a boomer take but Ranked has lost all meaning imo, and its blandness is part of what motivated me to not look at new ranked maps unless they're personally recommended to me. In 2018-ish, during modding v1, Ranked used to not only focus on whether or not something \*could\* be ranked, but would also be focused on polish, enjoyment, player perspective, and other small factors that would be considered trivial today, yet make a noticeable difference in the quality of the map. When I was active, I would often see strong suggestions being dismissed as "suggestive". I feel like this shift in ranking mentality came on slowly ever since there was a shift in focus in allowing heavily stylistic maps that may have been aesthetically abstract or unaccessible (late UC era, not assuming those maps are bad).*

*Now that we better understand the limits of the editor and what late modern mapping experimentation looks like, we are overdue to reupholster these standards that have been lost. In any creative role outside of osu!, one will more than likely find themselves changing aspects of their project in a way that goes against their creative spirit in order to add appeal, accessibility, or make it more publisher-friendly. There should be an acceptance towards that in the ranking process as well.*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-taiko news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!taiko</p>

*While 2023-2024 weren't great years either (thanks colour rework for discouraging creativity ESPECIALLY in metal maps), we hadn't been plagued as much by Russian hyperpop / tiktok cut ver. maps, maps being let through with lots of room to improve (which I blame the BNs for regarding quality standards and has been a running issue for years), new mappers not being encouraged to improve past their first ranked map or two, resulting in dozens of poorly made ranked maps, or otherwise low effort, with some BNs clearly not caring at all.*

*As a long-standing player, mapper, modder, and former BN it's just gotten tiresome and saddening to look at. There's always been some new face showing potential to become a great mapper every year for the longest time, but so far, after the first half of 2025 there hasn't been much of anything yet.*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-fruits news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!catch</p>

*While I would love for qualified maps to go through more eyes, I believe that due to the current modding meta it won't cause any meaningful improvements. Almost every high level map is ranked with notable issues with gameplay (most commonly bad balancing, rhythm and note grouping), but this is not something modders focus on and not something that the NAT pushes for modders to learn about.*

*Why I selected "no" instead of "neutral"? Catch modders also struggle to recognize rhythm simplification (and when to use it), improvisation and variety in things other than patterning. Because of that, they will often post suggestions that make the experience significantly worse.*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-mania news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!mania</p>

*There's been amazing progress these years, elitism isn't as prevalent and there's more freedom to what can be ranked, only thing I'd mention is to either remove or revamp the rating system, as it is outdated, mostly being weaponized for personal reasons, and when it's not it doesn't serve much purpose to what one can expect of a chart and its qualities. When it comes to showing popularity against a general public, favorites already serve that same purpose within an even higher degree as it is more limited to players, and of course isn't hidden at the bottom of the score screen*

*I do believe this would ease tensions between playerbases, as if there are any problems or disagreements the only way to go about it would be publicly discussing it instead of creating/keeping tension between groups using it against each other covertly*

### Players

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-osu news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!</p>

*For the most part I appreciate how diverse the Ranked section is now compared to many years ago, but when maps that are made to be the "least path of resistance" to attaining pp in the most glaringly obvious ways appear every other day it becomes disheartening. These same mappers and nominators responsible like to exhaust the people making quality concerns by jumping through hundreds of hoops to justify low quality jump mapping. Personally I don't contribute to these discussions because fundamental disagreement doesn't go anywhere and then there's nobody left to let their concerns have any effect on the ranking process.*

*With more relaxed standards set by the NAT and top players having more influence on what the "trendy" maps are (think mrekk asking for more aimslop on Twitter / mappers directly mapping for the strengths of certain top players), maybe it's just the majority of the community growing away from genuine interest and being streamlined.*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-taiko news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!taiko</p>

*Very very bad now, the ratio of maps that barely even made the cut in terms of quality (coupled with the song choice/variety thing mentioned above) to good maps are way higher than before — good maps are being buried down by quick attention grab and playcounts are consistently being diluted down in a game mode that barely has active players attempting now, rarely you will see a map with top diff actually filled up with over 50 scores (bare minimum to fill up the leaderboard) and yet people are still ranking so many maps as if there was even a demand to begin with.*

*Lots of filler maps that are made with the bare minimum of efforts, many "failed experimentation" (maps with interesting ideas but bad execution, or just straight up bad ideas in general — being pushed for just the sake of "promoting creativity" or not be wasted because they are winners of mapping contest or whatever that means), and maps that forgo playability/sightreadability in mind just because they wanted to be "creative".*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-fruits news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!catch</p>

*Current Ranked system has most maps feeling the same. A lot of the same patterns/gimmicks over and over and the quality within the maps itself is only falling. Lately there is also a loss in creativity as sounds are emphasized the same way across many maps, i.e hyperchains and 1/8s are used almost always in every deluge+ difficulty without fail within this last year.*

<i class="fal fa-extra-mode-mania news-chat-quote__mode-icon"></i>

<p class="news-chat-quote__mode-name news-chat-quote__colour-no-group">osu!mania</p>

*I think there used to be too many restrictions in what is rankable or not in the past but at the moment the ranked status allows everything that should be allowed. Although I think that there are some instances of "quality control" that shouldn't get the chart disallowed from ranked (a great example is monheim's joker chart).*

</div>

## Conclusion

To say that this data is valuable to us would be an understatement. Being able to put the community's opinion into numbers, and being able to compare and contrast these results with more empirical data and observations throughout several community discussions is of great help.

For one, it lets us know what the entire community is most interested in, beyond the direct feedback we get from the vocal few. Most importantly, it unfortunately also means that satisfying everyone's needs is out of the question. As such, we need to act with the utmost care and consideration when pushing new ideas forward.

We do hope that with these results being public, people get to understand the vast amount of different opinions this game has to offer. We also want to encourage users to draw their own conclusions from the [full (anonymised) results data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ImI8ErcmQLWFN2RcDRSZOcIIu4s696bJMX5LD2kh9wY/view?rm=minimal)!

Most importantly, we want to make clear that these results are **not binding**. While they will help us steer the ship towards more widely accepted changes, this does not mean that the team will only care about the majority of users while leaving the rest of the community stranded.

Lastly, a word of thanks to everyone who took the time to participate in the survey. Your trust on the game and teams involved is most appreciated.
