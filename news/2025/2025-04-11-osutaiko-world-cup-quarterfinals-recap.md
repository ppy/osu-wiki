Switching things up to a best-of-13 format, the Quarterfinals had some very close matches for some teams. Interestingly enough: every time the tiebreaker was played, the lower-seeded team came out as the victor. Not all of them were able to pull through and come out on top however, so the following teams were unfortunately eliminated: ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines, ::{ flag=CH }:: Switzerland, ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong, ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam, ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland, ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada, ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia, ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands, ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland, ::{ flag=SK }:: Slovakia, ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia & ::{ flag=NZ }:: New Zealand. Congratulations on both qualifying and making it this far in the tournament!

Wrapping up this train of tiebreaker upsets, we have perhaps the most surprising of the week: Team Australia (#8) vs. Team France (#19) — not only the largest difference in seeding, but with Team France holding a total of zero pick'em votes, truly nobody saw this coming.

Australia began by playing it safe with [Marmalade Butcher - =/=Virtual Futural](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347292#taiko/5048649) (NM1), taking their first point while testing the waters. However, France quickly showed that Australia might have gone fishing in the wrong lake, with a 100,000 point win on [Yunosuke - Ziqqurat (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347287#taiko/5048627) (NM6).

Having stirred the pot, the two teams began trading points: Australia winning [Mono. - skip&step](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2069452#taiko/4330009) (HR1), France taking [Hoshimachi Suisei - BIBBIDIBA(AL-1S & UZQueen's Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2207301#taiko/4673960) (NM2), followed by an Australian accuracy advantage on [DARK_GENE - GREEN MAMMALS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347276#taiko/5048593) (FM1), and an extremely narrow 5,000-point French victory on [Pmarusama. - Tokimeki Broker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2189313#taiko/4630501) (DT2).

While they remained tied at this point, Australia proved their dominance in reading skill with back-to-back wins on [yuha - Nou#m7 (feat. KAFU)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2190945#taiko/4634009) (HD2) and [AQUASINE - you wouldn't download a bird.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347271#taiko/5048585) (NM4)... France would do the same on the more finicky [Caravan Palace - City Cook](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2147535#taiko/4523594) (DT1) and [Schwank - BPM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347031#taiko/5047553) (FM2)! At this point, the counting connoisseurs among the viewers knew it was time for yet another tiebreaker.

[Supire - Dead Aire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#taiko/5048624) (TB) rolled in to raise the tension, and despite an incredible Hidden performance from ::{ flag=AU }:: [Jaye](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4841352), Team France proved to be the bigger fish. Three sets of scores over 900,000 brought them a well-deserved victory.

### ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore vs. ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan

One of the most intense matches so far, Singapore vs. Taiwan has surely kept viewers on their toes all the way through.

Singapore held some solid momentum at the very start through [Yunosuke - Ziqqurat (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347287#taiko/5048627) (NM6) and the majority of [yuha - Nou#m7 (feat. KAFU)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2190945#taiko/4634009) (HD2). However, with one slip-up in the ending section of HD2, Taiwan jumped on the opportunity instantly and chipped away the score difference slowly but steadily, until it came to the **last second of the map**. Yes, you heard that right, Taiwan managed to clutch up the lead at exactly the last second, cementing the fact that they won't be going down easily in this match.

After a very intense accuracy battle and 6 FCs on [Mono. - skip&step](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2069452#taiko/4330009) (HR1), players headed into the next pick, [DARK_GENE - GREEN MAMMALS (hyper mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347276#taiko/5048593) (FM1), where all 6 players decided that it's time for a full HDHR lobby. Despite the uphill battle against Team Taiwan's combo, Team Singapore was able to secure the point just by hitting the notes more accurately.

Only a couple of picks and intense neck-and-neck battles later, the unbelievable happened. Once again, Team Taiwan won [Pmarusama. - Tokimeki Broker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2189313#taiko/4630501) after ::{ flag=SG }:: [Prehistoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8364237) found an unfortunate miss on one of the last patterns in the map. The score lead quickly jumped over to the side of the Taiwanese team within the last few seconds of the map and brought another very fierce match to the tiebreaker.

After both teams used their well-deserved 2-minute timeout to take a breather, everything came down to one last map. With [Supire - Dead Aire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#taiko/5048624) (TB) already playing in the background, the players knew they only had one last chance to come out on top. One player, namely ::{ flag=TW }:: [HarryAda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12892087), was brave enough to go into this tiebreaker with the Hidden mod enabled. This kept the score lead ever so slightly on the side of the Taiwanese team. Despite ::{ flag=SG }:: [Blerargh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7609510)'s high accuracy of 99.57%, Team Taiwan was able to pull through with the Hidden mod's score multiplier, supported by ::{ flag=TW }:: [HiGreeks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16536516)' combo of 2,349. It was just not enough for Team Singapore.

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile

One of the most anticipated matches of the entire weekend was none other than the winners' bracket clash between Team United States (#3) and Team Chile (#6). With 88.5% of the pick'em vote, viewers were convinced that Team United States had the upper hand in this close matchup, perhaps not expecting that another tiebreaker was on its way!

Everything started smoothly with Team United States experimenting on the new slot of the pool, picking [Yunosuke - Ziqqurat (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347287#taiko/5048627) (NM6), showcasing a strong three-way full-combo and convincing win. Chile responded with [Schwank - BPM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347031#taiko/5047553) (FM2) on the opposite side of the pool, displaying their mod prowess with a victory on the triple HDHR.

This trend was short-lived as Team Chile won a break point on [Hoshimachi Suisei - BIBBIDIBA(AL-1S & UZQUEEN's Edit)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2207301#taiko/4673960) (NM2), with Team United States immediately winning it back on [yuha - Nou#m7 (feat. KAFU)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2190945#taiko/4634009) (HD2). However, Team Chile managed to keep the momentum in their favour as they took another break point on [Umeboshi Chazuke - Lollipop*driveR](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347262#taiko/5048575) (NM3) and won their own pick of [reallerr - a funk that never stops](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347270#taiko/5048584) (HD1).

Team United States did not let this ruin their morale as they output three incredible performances in a row on [CBR - Love Maker!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347267#taiko/5048581) (NM5), Team Chile's [AQUASINE - you wouldn't download a bird.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347271#taiko/5048585) (NM4) pick, and [Caravan Palace - City Cook](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2147535#taiko/4523594) (DT1), bringing them to the highly crucial match point. With only a few options left, Team Chile took their chances on [+TEK - starlove](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2213428#taiko/4689756) (HR2) and denied Team United States the easy way out with a fifth point of their own, forcing the match into the tiebreaker!

Once again, [Supire - Dead Aire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#taiko/5048624) (TB) descended onto the stage, where two players on each team looked to seize the advantage by playing with Hidden. Team Chile ended up managing to secure an early lead and never let it go, narrowly securing their place in the Semifinals winners' bracket and upsetting Team United States by 36,748 points.

## Score highlights

A couple of scores from last weekend stood out from the rest, which we by no means want to withhold from you!

- ::{ flag=CL }:: [ulko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669)'s stunning silver SS on [yuha - Nou#m7 (feat. KAFU)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2190945#taiko/4634009) (HD2) in their match against the United States, despite not winning the map, makes this one of the scariest threats to Team South Korea, as they will be facing Chile in this weekend's Semifinals.
- Not one, not two, but **three** players have shown, that even 39-second-long streams are nothing to be afraid of (for them at least). After 3:20 minutes of intense stream baking, ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027), ::{ flag=KR }:: [Rosemarie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2228401) and ::{ flag=US }:: [SilverTyrant](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14356353) have hit all the notes with perfect accuracy on [CBR - Love Maker!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347267#taiko/5048581) (NM5).
