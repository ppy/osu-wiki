One of the 17 full years of mapping ended just last month, and this will be the moment to pick its most memorable maps!

Every year, all four corners of the community are invited to a big imaginary round table to debate on the collection of circles, drums, fruits and keys (i.e. beatmaps) that deserve recognition above all others.

The way it works is that you have **10 votes per game mode** to toss at **any map ranked during 2024 that you have played at least once**. Further down, you'll find a set of specially crafted contest pages that will automatically list all the maps that *you* can vote for.

Once **14 days** pass and votes are tallied up, the top 10 picks per game mode will forevermore be known as *Community Favourites of 2024*, the mappers of each receiving 1 month of osu!supporter. The gold winners, on the other hand, receive 6 months plus a shiny profile badge that is not unlike the design you see at the very top of this news post.

That's not all, however, because the same deal applies to the *Mappers' Favourites*, prizes and everything. Here we count the votes of anyone who has ranked at least one map, letting the makers of the craft sort out the maps that *really* mattered during 2024.

This means there is a total of *80 distinct spots* to fill on the final showcase! Or less, if mappers and players agree on the best maps. (But that rarely happens.)

Now, there is but one thing left to do, which is to review the past year in numbers:

| Game mode | Beatmaps | Difficulties | Difference from [2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-02-12-community-choice-2023-results) |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: |
| osu! | 3,510 | 14,524 | +63% |
| osu!taiko | 1,213 | 4,950 | +48% |
| osu!catch | 437 | 1,314 | +25% |
| osu!mania (4k) | 980 | 3,067 | +0.13% |
| osu!mania (7k) | 162 | 577 | +7.1% |
| **Total** | 6,253 | 24,763 | +43% |

It would seem that the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) have been busy.

Anyway, let's not wait any longer. You'll find your repertoire of played maps to vote for below:

- [osu! voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/231)
- [osu!taiko voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/232)
- [osu!catch voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/233)
- [osu!mania 4K voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/234)
- [osu!mania 7K voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/235)
- [osu!mania other voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/237)

Unlike previous times, the voting for osu!mania is split out to 4K, 7K and other key modes due to popular demand.

Again, you have **14 days** from now to decide, so don't get stuck between maps for too long.

May the best maps win!
