## ![Songs](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-24-pending-cup-2025/section-songs.jpg) {#songs}

This year, we're keeping the song selection simple and have picked songs from the extensive Featured Artist track library. While revisiting the previous Pending Cup format of having three different categories, there's a slight twist: **Vocal**, **Instrumental**, and **Original**.

Download the beatmap template for any one of these songs, read the [rules](#rules), then start mapping!

### Vocal track

| Song | Colorful Sounds Port feat. [Sennzai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/110) - Jewelry Beans |
| --: | :-- |
| Genre | J-Pop |
| Download | [Beatmap template (3:30 / 134 BPM)](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/Pending%20Cup%202025%20-%20Colorful%20Sounds%20Port%20feat.%20Sennzai%20-%20Jewelry%20Beans.osz) |

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/110/Fleurix/Colorful%20Sounds%20Port%20feat.%20Sennzai%20-%20Jewelry%20Beans.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

Glamour and romance aren't usually on the rhythm game agenda, but our first song *Jewelry Beans* is here to flip the script. First released in 2018 by vocalist **Sennzai** on her album *Fleurix*, this 134 BPM canvas offers a diverse set of 1/4 sounds while maintaining a relatively low-intensity, upbeat atmosphere. Your objective is to turn this pop-esque song into a mapping masterpiece.

### Instrumental track

| Song | [Kurubukko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/217) - alive |
| --: | :-- |
| Genre | IDM |
| Download | [Beatmap template (2:17 / 260 BPM)](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/Pending%20Cup%202025%20-%20Kurubukko%20-%20alive.osz) |

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/217/Songs/Kurubukko%20-%20alive.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

**Kurubukko**'s song *alive* fits no distinct genre, incorporating an artcore ambiance with the vibes of early 2000s trance in its own IDM style. In other words, this track is weird, and that weirdness may lead to your own unique brand of innovation.

### Original track

| Song | [Trina Lydia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/440) - TETRATONE ALTiSSiMO |
| --: | :-- |
| Genre | Electronic |
| Download | [Beatmap template (2:19 / 186 BPM)](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/Pending%20Cup%202025%20-%20Trina%20Lydia%20-%20TETRATONE%20ALTiSSiMO.osz) |

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/440/TETRATONE%20ALTiSSiMO/Trina%20Lydia%20-%20TETRATONE%20ALTiSSiMO.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

Mappers inevitably face a situation where they can't come up with their next pattern. When mapping *TETRATONE ALTiSSiMO* however, that's almost an impossibility. This 186 BPM tune is the perfect template for any mapper, offering just the right balance of complexity and accessible rhythm options, all packed within a classic ~2-minute rhythm game song length. Originally created for [osu!mania's 1K Dan Course](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2234187#mania/4745284), this track is receiving the full range of mapping possibilities through what you'll create for Pending Cup 2025.

### Submission

Once you are finished, head over to the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/267) to submit your map. You are allowed to resubmit your entry anytime before the mapping phase has ended.

### Judging criteria

| Rubric | Details |
| :-: | :-- |
| Expertise (40%) | Expertise refers to how well the map executes itself to reflect the elements in the music. This reflects the technical skill of a mapper. However, in the Pending Cup, judging is not modding. Although we promote maps with expertise and professionalism and care about details, judges are discouraged from being nitpicky on small mistakes or minor unrankables, and will instead score in this category while considering an overarching picture of the map. |
| Creativity (40%) | Creativity refers to how reasonably outstanding the map is compared to the current mapping meta. A generic map in the current mapping meta or copy-pasting concepts from other "famous" maps is discouraged. The Pending Cup promotes creativity, so the winners of PDC should guide the mapping meta instead of following it. |
| Judge's Impression (20%) | Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry. The base Judge's Impression score is set to 10, and judges must explicitly mention why they apply any additions or deductions to that score. |

*Judges are instructed to be consistent in their judging style across each track when judging.*
