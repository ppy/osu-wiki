## Beatmapping

### Limitation

*Limitations* are a staple of the Monthly Beatmapping Contest. These are essentially extra rules that make each month's contest (and its submitted maps) distinct!

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [Morusya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13681464) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

Finishers are already big, but this contest aims to give them even more of a focus.

This month's osu!taiko theme is **finishers**.

Finishers should be used liberally, and in the judging phase, maps will be evaluated on how well finishers are used in pretty much every aspect (along with the usual mapping quality–related criteria). This includes finisher creativity, finisher playability, finishers in regards to map quality, and... you get the idea.

#### osu!catch

Difficulty settings are the basis of any map. This month's contest aims to change how you use these values.

This month's osu!catch limitation: **all difficulty settings must be equal.**

Circle size, approach rate, overall difficulty, and HP drain are the relevant settings in this case. Each of these must be the same value!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!taiko:** create a map based around finishers
  - **osu!catch:** all difficulty settings must be equal
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
