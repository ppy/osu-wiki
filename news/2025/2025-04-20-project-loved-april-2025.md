No fools here, welcome to Project Loved April!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Spring has sprung and the Loved bunny has brought you some new picks! Unsure what we do here? Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll. Alternatively you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

Want to get involved? Those in the community (including you reading this!) can submit maps on our [website](https://loved.sh/) for our captains to look at, so spread some osu! love to your favourite maps, we want to hear it!

Thanks you for your votes in March's voting! You can view the results using the links below:

- [Results for osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2056047)
- [Results for osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2056046)
- [Results for osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2056045)
- [Results for osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2056044)

To start us off, the osu! game mode is going through a minor change in Project Loved. The *Chill Champions* category will be formally retired and no longer receive any more nominations going forward. This is due to the number of suitable maps getting less and less, and the picks being spread thin. Don't fret though! Maps of a similar calibre will continue to be nominated under other categories, such as *Outstanding Oldies* or *Ranked Rejects*, or as a *Wildcard* pick!

This month, [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761) from the osu! captains has departed from the team, please say a farewell to them and thank them for their contributions!

In more fitting news for the season, we are opening applications for osu!catch captains! Please use the link below to apply if you think you'll fit the role:

[![osu!catch captain application banner](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved/apply-catch.png)](https://forms.gle/jpZG2NFFrKoFGbbn8)

At last here's the picks, but don't forget, we host [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer) playlists for fighting to the top of the leaderboard with the newly nominated maps! If you earn yourself the top spot of any respective playlist, you earn yourself a month of [supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support)!

*description written by [Plasma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077431)*

Pioneering the skill caps of hundreds of aspiring aim players alike, this month's second *Popular Playcount* pick goes to [For You the Bellz Toll](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/974713#osu)!

With an astonishing variance in star rating ranging from 3.58â˜… to an exceptional 11.07â˜…, this gauntlet of a mapset specialises in aim that, on one half of the spectrum, gets your cursor moving at breakneck speeds, while on the other half, offers a carefree experience that pretty much anyone can have a crack at.

Additionally, if you aren't quite up to shape to hit some of the cross-screen jumps in the 11â˜… difficulty, there is a nerfed (albeit still very difficult) 9.79â˜… version which tones the spacing down a reasonable amount, perhaps just enough to let higher-ranked players connect larger combos and achieve lower miss counts.

Be sure to vote yes if you wish to see how far boundaries can be broken by giving this mapset a leaderboard, as well as a place in Loved!

On this month of *Outstanding Oldies*, we have a map being nominated by someone whose osu! join date was SIX YEARS after the release of this classic mapset. I'll try my best on this one, team.

You may remember this map if you are an extreme veteran, playing back in the ages of "totally accurate" star rating and ppv1... Or maybe, you may remember this map continuously showing up as FM2 in your tournament mappools.

Regardless, [bAd Companyz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/92234#osu) is one of [caren_sk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/542498)'s (also known as CRN) most classic underground gems! This set provides three difficulties, with each one altering the map's difficulty settings more and more, and providing a challenge for many.

Make sure to vote YES on this map's Loved poll for the month, you won't want to miss it.

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick goes past the point of no return.

[Arcana Eden](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1894892#osu) is definitely a spectacle. If you haven't seen it, go take a look at it. Doesn't matter if you're a mapper or a player. Everyone should just look at this.

I won't spoil the map too much, but expect some heavy "tech"-inspired sliders and patterns, extreme aim control and ridiculously fast-paced gameplay. There's no shortage of surprises here, and honestly, in my nearly 17 years of playing this game, there are things in this beatmap that I simply cannot comprehend how they were done. I hope it gets the same reaction from you. If it does, make sure to vote Yes on this!

This month's *Daredevil Difficulties* pick goes to none other than [Yusomi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4174940)'s mapset of [Tati-U2C-Sgagachi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/593434#osu)!

Submitted in the second half of 2017, the Playful difficulty features high-intensity snap aim, ranging from widely spaced triangle jumps to the iconic wiggles immediately followed by persistent 280 BPM jumps in the latter half that give this map such an iconic reputation regarding its difficulty.

**But that's not all!**

[Yusomi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4174940) has also included an additional difficulty, Gleeful, which features higher spacing at a larger circle size of 4, as well as generally more comfortable patterns throughout the map compared to the original. Included with these difficulties are also AR 9.7 versions if the circles fade in a little too quickly for your liking.

Be sure to check this map out and vote yes if you want to see this enter the Loved category!

POV: You're a 4-digit tournament player in the year 2020:

```
7:50 AM | Wake up (sorry you're west coast NA buddy, time to wake up for 15 UTC)\
7:55 AM | Log on to your PC\
8:00 AM | Join the multi lobby (after 20 bancho attempts)\
8:05 AM | Play HD1, Feryquitous feat. Aitsuki Nakuru - Kairikou \[Skystar's Irregular\]\
8:20 AM | Play HR1, Function Phantom - Neuronecia \[Ethereal\] (man who is balancing this pool)\
8:45 AM | Congrats, you've made it to tiebreaker! Enjoy USAO - Chrono Diver -PENDULUMs- \[Tempus\]\
8:51 AM | Log off and go back to bed (just kidding you have 4 more matches on a beautiful Saturday)\
```

For those who remember the golden days of [Maid Bot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16173747), you'll get it. For those who don't: this month's *Ranked Rejects* pick is your chance to find out! [seros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10562853) finally lands in the Loved section with [Feryquitous - Arcahv](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1340339#osu/2930403), a stunning modern take on the beloved light-tech genre. A fusion of skills like awkward aim, slider control, cutstreams, and density reading will put your [Skystar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961) homework to the test if you dare to take on this map.

What are you waiting for? [Aidown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1522146) just pinged us â€” matches start in 15, invites go out in 10. I'm so ready to play [HD4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16XWerpM59OG9tatynhdSdqx7l5xht6IkUVkXz5qi9i4/edit?gid=420399140#gid=420399140)!

(Do you know what I love more than gimmicks? Puzzles, I really love Puzzles!)

This month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* pick is special. And- well, it's more than just a gimmick map..\
I'll be honest. Um- It's more than just a map for that matter..\
[Nhelv](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2159609#osu) is a beautifully stunning and visual and gameplay experience. It's able to throw all sorts of awe-inspiring aspire-esque puzzles your way,\
and I'll just let this O.P map's one-thousand-sixty-six objects speak for themselves,\
because Wow- [pw384](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1343783) really is a **"Visioneer"** of technical-mapping..

Uh- If you wanna know a fun fact.. well-\
This map is physically FC-able, so good luck to all you aspire-grinders ðŸ”¥\
I'm excited to see your scores... #aspire-grinders

Anyways, um-\
Voting **"ZFT"** for this map in April's Loved polls is key to making sure this map ends up in the Loved category.\
So be sure to do so..

Fine, I'll say what everyone thinks but is too afraid to say: [sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698) might just be one of the greatest mappers of all time.

You think I picked [Indiana Jones](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1988958#osu/4131853) for this month's *Meme Monstrosities* as a joke? A meme is something that is spread throughout humanity, and this is something that has to be preached. Every circle and slider is placed to perfectly represent the artistic quality of Yuno Miles, elevating the medium of osu! to a new level of experience that philosophers have pondered and searched for aeons.

If you feel any love or enlightenment like I have after trying this map out, smash that Yes button to get *Indiana Jones* Loved.

Jessica Jarrell (Candyland Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/570075#osu).

Clearly, the folks back in 2018 didn't enjoy it, however... so let's try this one more time!

This mapset features three difficulties, all tailored to the AR of your choice, offering a challenging yet relaxing rendition of this EDM remix. Despite sitting at 6.88â˜…, many top players used to play this map for a thrilling aim challenge. Now, IN THE BIG 25, imagine how many top players might DT this map...

Vote YES on your phones and computers now if you want to give this mapset a second shot at the Loved category!

Sitting at a respectable (or deceitful, depending on your skill set) 7.06â˜…, this one's full of tricky cutstreams and clean, crisp patterns to skill-check your aim control. If you're familiar with the iconic patterns of [Nathan's true DJ MAG](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1357624#osu/2809623), then you know what to expect from this map. Also, make sure to enable the immersive storyboard for the full experience!

This one's been gathering over 300 favourites and 75,000 plays in the graveyard since 2022, and honestly, LATHI has some of the most satisfying patterns to hit. Be sure to try this one out and cast your vote!

Ladies and gentlemen, our second *Wildcard* pick for this month gets rather... classic. Or would you rather say *classical*?

If you played [Fenza](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2740518)'s only Ranked mapset, Beethoven's [Moonlight Sonata](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/518426#osu/1101611), you know what to expect. If you didn't play it, go play that one too! It never hurts to get to know more classical music. This time, Fenza brings us Mozart's *Turkish March*, composed around 1783, played by Arcadi Volodos. If you think a nearly 250-year-old piece of music might not fit into a rhythm game, think again! This mapset has tons of streams and finger/aim control patterns that make this song engaging to play. For those who are into playing unconventional types of beatmaps, this one is for you.

We're kicking off this month's osu!taiko Loved picks with an absolute banger. With [EGTS 2025](https://gratiaproductions.com/egts/home) coming to a close, it's only fitting for this map to finally acquire its long-awaited Loved status. Surprisingly, it's the only [EGTS 2022](https://gtsosu.com/2022/egts/home) tiebreaker without a leaderboard, and now's the time to change that!

At first glance, you might get fooled. 200 BPM and only a mere 8.87â˜… for the supposed taiko gods of EGTS? But one crucial detail is missing: it's mapped by [Roxy-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11931563) and [4sbet1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671). And this isn't just any ordinary 200 BPM map. During your playthrough, you'll venture through the absolute madness of odd 1/6 coupled with extremely **brutal** tech sections that can cause anyone to notelock in the blink of an eye. And the cherry on top? An insane 400 BPM speed section to close out the map.

Proficient German speakers might've already picked up on the song name â€” *Epitaph of the Gods*. That's because the map is the culmination of everything that led up to the selection of the top three of EGTS 2022. It's almost been three years since this tiebreaker has actually been played in a match, but no one can forget the [masterful standoff](https://youtu.be/Vt6vVQTo-Ck?si=u9D42r15_8CbBU3L&t=3703) between goheegy and Minekuchi on this map, which decided who would have the opportunity to battle for a spot in the winners' bracket Grand Finals.

So, are you intrigued? Perhaps fascinated? Then I wholeheartedly suggest you go take that excitement to the polls!

*description written by [nevqr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14269506)*

What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear someone say *Sound Chimera*? Well, I certainly hope it's epic boss maps, because we're here to deliver one! [Foxeru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7479684) said it best himself â€” *"Every other mode has some sort of boss map for Sound Chimera in Loved, maybe taiko could get some love too?"* And taiko will get some love too.

Laur's *Sound Chimera* is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most famous songs on osu!. The combination of psytrance and hardcore creates insanely difficult maps regardless of the mode â€” and this map is no exception.

This version of [Sound Chimera](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1926888#taiko) is a Brazillian collaboration by none other than [Foxeru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7479684) and [HiroK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4050738). If you love tech maps that feature a lot of improvisation, you're in for a treat. As if playing a constant 190 BPM stream wasn't enough, these mappers went all out on 1/6 and 1/8 improvisation while also utilizing patterns that you'd seldom see in any other maps! In fact, I'd argue the Loved section has not seen a similar map yet! That said, you're just going to have to take my word for it. :D

But one more question still stands: Do you want to make a bargain and be taken aboard Foxeru's and HiroK's rocket ship? Then make sure to give this map a try and cast your vote!

Not one, not two, but *THREE* skill-cap marathon maps are being put up for nomination in the month of April. And no, you're not seeing triple. To close off this month's high-star picks, I've decided to choose [PLANET//SHAPER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1586890#taiko/3241079) by [aHTaoN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4655546).

aHTaoN is one of those mappers who kind of linger in the back of players' minds but don't get a lot of recognition. You see, aHTaoN already has a couple of Loved and Ranked guest difficulties, but sadly, he's never been given the chance to get a Loved map of his own.

Truth be told, most osu!taiko Camellia maps, that aren't high in BPM or aren't specifically made for rhythm games like *SDVX*, don't usually reach high difficulty levels. However, aHTaoN had something different in store for us.

Mapped in a dump double-BPM style, you're bound to encounter various odd snaps and technical patterns throughout the entire map! No let-ups, consistent difficulty, and even several diff spikes â€” this is exactly what the Loved section persistently yearns for. Does that sound too easy for you? Don't you worry! aHTaoN was kind enough to include an uprate clocking in at a whopping 10.38â˜…!

Are you ready to compete for the #1 spot on this total monster of a map? If so, go check it out and drop a vote in the polls!

[Ding](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1282975#taiko/2664544) mapped by [HiroK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4050738), is here to bring a low-SR refresher to this month's osu!taiko Loved picks! This gem isn't about speed or technical patterns, it's an entry-level gimmick map that welcomes less experienced players with open arms.

When opening this map, you'll immediately notice a big note in your hitbox. More experienced gimmick players will know what's in store seeing that... Do not fret though, because this map starts out as normal and slowly transitions into the 0 BPM finisher gimmick. It's the perfect entry point for those looking to dip their toes into different taiko gimmick maps!

HiroK has done an amazing job finding balance with creativity and accessibility. Whether you're just starting your gimmick map journey or simply looking for a relaxing yet engaging challenge, I'm sure Ding will leave a good impression.

For those looking for a more challenging gimmick map, make sure to check out the next map in this month's Loved article. ðŸ‘€

If there was one gimmick map that would define my early osu!taiko days, [Michael Stiefel - Rhythm Jump Studio Rift](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1380482#taiko/5063731) by [Cookie_Tree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/502722) is definitely the one that comes to mind. If you've been hanging around in taiko community discussions, or have played in the *osu! Taiko Collegiate League 2022*, you've definitely seen this map before.

This goofy little track from known platform game **A Hat in Time** captures the essence of time ticking down, and the metronome gives players hints of nervousness throughout the map. However, once you've gotten the hang of the gimmick, this map is insanely fun to play! [Cookie_Tree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/502722), with their SV maneuvering prowess shown in their previous Loved maps, uses flying Don finishers and very slow Kat finishers as metronomes to guide (or distract) you throughout the song. As these finisher patterns never change you may think it's not that big of a roadblock, but the different patterns that accompany them will keep changing so try not to get lost in the sauce!

Already conquered the previous map in this month's Loved article? Or simply want to challenge yourself against others to some metronome-ing fun? Please consider voting "Yes" to give this map the Loved status it is worthy of and share it with your gimmick-loving friends!

Making an appearance in the Loved section once again is [katacheh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6651672), but not for the usual fanfare of bar lines and gimmick notes â€” instead, it's a hitsound map!

osu!taiko is unique, in that hitsounds affect the coloring of notes, and hence gameplay. This additional hassle makes hitsound maps far and few between in this mode.

In all, this makes [t+pazolite feat. Nanahira - Niesonae](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/974667#taiko/2040122) a unique experience, with great execution in both coloring and hitsounding. If you enjoy the map, be sure to vote yes!

On the surface, JDM may not seem too difficult to some in reading due to the map being 6â˜…, 128 BPM and 6 years old, but those who recognise JDM will recognise it for its usage in [osu!taiko World Cup 2019 Finals week 2](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2019#finals-week-2) as a **Double Time** map!

No-modding this map is a low-BPM tech challenge due to the variety of 1/4, 1/8 and especially 1/6 snapping, with 1/6 showing up as conventional 4-note patterns, doublets and entire streams at points, most notably at the end of the map where 1/8 is also mixed in! Playing this as how it was in TWC is no joke, with the 1/6 being 288 BPM and the 1/8 bursts being 384 BPM. This turns a low-BPM tech map into a battle of keeping up with the speed and constant rhythmic changes!

Regardless of if you feel like playing the map as it was made or rivaling the scores from TWC 2019, Enjoy! â”—(ï¼¾0ï¼¾)â”“â”—(ï¼¾0ï¼¾)â”“â”—(ï¼¾0ï¼¾)â”“

ExileLord in CTB is quite common amongst the Loved section and is known for songs mapped at devastating difficulty and, at times, extreme length. *Soulless* 4 did precisely that, followed by *Soulless 3*, which was shorter in length but similar in difficulty. What if it was more challenging in both ways?

Welcome, [Soulless 5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1168401#fruits). This beatmap is lengthier than *Soulless 4* by almost 5 minutes extra, coming in at over 10,000 combo, pushing the Score V1 integer limit to its MAXIMUM, with over 1.4 trillion score for an FC.

On top of this, this map features patterns that some could argue are more challenging than *Soulless 4*'s patterning in terms of difficulty spikes, but are more manageable for slower sections.

Still, this map features many resemblances to *Soulless 4*'s patterning, including double stacks, hyperwalks, and some reading tests scattered throughout with gimmicky patterning. Give it a try. This map's length and combo count already make it insane.

This one is waiting for you, ExGon.

If you've ever played multiplayer matches, then there is a good chance you've played this map before as it is a very popular pick for a lot of players (even more so when it was still new). Now, this map is turning almost 9 years old, and it is still a very well-known map in the community.

Unlike other [DakkyChan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2107017) maps, this one isn't crazy difficult â€” it doesn't have hyperwalks or other gimmicks you usually see in his maps. This is mapped in an older mapping style and focuses more on high-SV patterns and difficult jumps, sometimes getting close to being edge dashes. In between, you also have some stream and wiggle patterns, making the map heavily varied in style. While it is significantly easier than other DakkyChan maps, it still requires a high amount of consistency to do well on, as some of the patterns can end your combo if you read them too late or your positioning isn't perfect.

This is an amazing map that deserves to finally get a leaderboard for people to compete on. I encourage anyone that doesn't know this map yet to give it a try!

[Enjuxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10727985) is a staple within the community regarding gimmick maps with fair and reasonable gameplay. [silly 300 BPM thing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1731773#fruits/3539780) is a map mainly composed of precise and fast, unrelenting snaps. Hence... 300 BPM...

The gameplay for this map is nice overall: you can hold dash for almost the entire map, like most 300 BPM maps. This map also features relatively high-quality hitsounds for a map that was not meant to be ranked in the first place, so the effort put into this map is undoubtedly there. Give it a try!

There's a first for everything.

[lovely_hyahya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10318380)'s [Shuu no Hazama](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2027029#mania/4223691) includes a quite uncommon feature: invisible long notes! They are however well telegraphed and you should see them coming, along with their very prominent musical representation. Speaking of musical representation, I don't think there's any need to introduce [Shuu no Hazama](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2027029#mania/4223691) anymore â€” a song of many implementations across all modes, even being featured in last month's Loved voting with [another 7K set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1130083)!

Outside of those invisible LNs, [Shuu no Hazama](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2027029#mania/4223691) defines itself as focused a fair bit on reading and SV. The syncopation inherent to the song makes rhythm complexity higher than the average, and some of the polyrhythmic structures will definitely challenge the unprepared. It certainly requires a bit of practice to get this map down correctly.

When it rains, it pours, so you're getting a lot of [Shuu no Hazama](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2027029#mania/4223691). But it doesn't have to be a bad thing, since you can make it good by voting in the attached thread!

Welcome back [Xingyue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9614083) to Loved, it always is nice to see these more comfortable charts get a chance in the spotlight, and I can only think of a few maps more comfortable than the jumpstreams that are present in [Discommunication Alien](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1411397#mania/2909745).

I don't know about other people, but I vividly remember playing this map over and over again because of how satisfying it was to see myself slowly improving my speed, and I would often use this as a baseline for the speed that I could play at a time. Looking back on it now, I don't know if it was the best way to improve or the best indication of how good I was, but what I do know is that this map is just so fun that it doesn't matter. The patterning present isn't anything too complicated, but that is part of why I believe it is so great. Going all the way up to around 240 BPM jumpstreams, it isn't necessarily the fastest in the world, but it is a great way to practice your consistency since it is very balanced throughout.

I feel like many osu! players have struggled with talking to people at least once in their lives, and I feel like this song represents it pretty well (even though it is one of the most popular VTubers singing it). So, if you want to feel less like an alien, be sure to give your opinion by voting on this map!

To me, [Ena](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13799949)'s charts represent a lot of what the challenges of chordjack charts present to you. A great example would be how this chart in specific requires a lot of control, stamina, and reading ability. While it starts off with some streams, it immediately throws you many chordjacks that could be really startling if you don't pay attention. Control is an essential part of this chart because of the different transitions that are here, wherein you have to switch between jumps, hands, and even quads all around the chart. Not to mention, there are also different sets of jumptrills in different areas of this chart, which could also easily decrease your stamina.

Speaking of which, this chart is 3 minutes and 21 seconds long, and with only a few breaks, it could really be a daunting task to be consistent on. With an already difficult challenge of control and stamina, your reading will definitely be affected as well. Honestly, this chart has so many interesting parts, and I'm sure everyone is looking forward to see what the top leaderboard scores will be! Oh, and let's not forget, if you think 1.0x is too easy, there are rates up to 1.4x on this chart.

Are you looking forward to more stamina-draining chordjack charts in the future? Then I say that it's about time this gets into Project Loved with your vote!

Perhaps it's just a true sign of someone who enjoys charting for the fun of it?

Dating all the way back to 2016, this classic set has a style that's all too similar to what you'd see in this day and age, containing much of the drum focus you'd see in a rock chart during that time, and today as well! The approach to this song is definitely a factor in the massive popularity it has, as the full spread appeals to many players, including those just starting out and those who've got the experience. Of course, the song itself is a factor as well, considering the popularity behind it.

To all those who've enjoyed this set, you can now give it the leaderboard it's long deserved by voting in the thread!

[Ska](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10313023) has many, many possible charts that could be going up for Loved at the moment. However, it's very apparent that [Still Into You](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1709535#mania/3493274) was the most anticipated to go up next.

In typical Ska fashion, you can expect a dump that's nothing from what you'd consider normal. However, it can be argued that this is one of his more straightforward-esque of charts, containing a heavy amount of 1/4 jacks intertwined with single streams of varying snaps. This approach sounds rather unorthodox, but you'd find it shocking just how well it captures the music, as it manages to find seamless ways to transition between said jacks and streams.

As usual, there are uprates for those who don't think this is enough of a challenge on the base rate.

Are you still into this chart? If so, you're encouraged to give it your support!

I met [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656) in real life several times in my lifetime, all of which revolved around instances of [cavoeboy's osu! event](https://cavoeboy.com/). I will always remember that one train trip where he unfortunately missed his chance with a lovely German girl we met on the way. If that girl happens to read this description, I don't even think she would know what I'm talking about.

In any case, there's not really any need to introduce the legend that is juankristal. But in case you're new enough to the osu!mania community, juankristal has been one of the longest-standing figures of the osu! community, with many contributions to the tournament scene both as a player and as a mapper, including the really early days of MWC ([think 2015](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2015)). I say as a tournament contributor, if anyone were to ask to bring up one single name among the many long note pioneers that have existed within the history of osu!mania... Well, juankristal would be the one name that people would converge to.

*No.39* is yet another entry to Juan's infamous *timing hell* series. What does "timing hell" even mean? Okay, so the textbook definition of a "timing hell" mostly revolves around fast coordination, also featuring a lot of staggered shields and minijacks that make it really difficult to last throughout all of the map. Timing hells are often really draining for stamina and focus, especially when high scores are paramount to a tournament victory, and *No.39* was in fact concocted for the [MWC 2022 Grand Finals](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K#grand-finals). It is definitely not the easiest of the timing hell series, and it packs a punch even for seasoned players.

Now that we're done with the textbook definition, here's the *actual* backstory behind the "timing hell" nomenclature. Well, allegedly, as I'm kind of paraphrasing a story that I've been told second-hand. When juankristal was mapping his first timing hells, he had a bit of trouble on properly timing the map. If I recall correctly, even after a fair amount of help had been gathered to time this map, there were *still* timing issues that occurred during the mapping process, which in turn provoked the quite humorous label of "timing hell" on what otherwise was pretty much idiomatic mapping by juankristal, as he's always had (and still has) a very unique and recognizable style of LN mapping.

Ask us about more tournament fire camp stories in the thread after you drop your vote for this Loved entry. Or maybe ask us on whichever common Discord server suits you instead. We're pretty much deep within retirement centers at this point.

If I remember correctly, it's been a while since we've introduced you to a challenging high-difficulty LN map. This time, we're introducing [HAVOX](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/653504#mania/1385278) by [LostCool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766374) for those who want to challenge the limits of their LN skills!

How do we describe this map... a classic boss map? It's a barrage of tricky patterns at a fast BPM, which makes the map deserving of that label.

Dense LN streams, lots of grace notes, and mash-type fast staircases form the tricky patterns that are unique to LostCool, creating a difficulty level worthy of this magnificent song and challenging many players.

If you're up for such a challenge, make your voice heard by voting!

This month we're going to nominate this map by 2 ETs, [Kim_GodSSI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2218047) and [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737). The map's style is based around releases, requiring that you bring your abilities on LN releases and tricky patterns to the table. Your reading ability and finger coordination are tested as well. If the 155 BPM diff is a piece of cake for you, then you could try the top diff, which is sped up from 155 BPM to 192 BPM and was featured in the 4th stage of the [7K LN Zenith Dan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1220647#mania/2764028). Anyway, good luck on challenging this!
