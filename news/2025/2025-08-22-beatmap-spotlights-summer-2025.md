Even though it's August already, the sun is still shining brightly outside. So what else is there to enjoy other than a full sweat-on run through the best beatmaps of the last months, carefully selected by the **Beatmap Spotlights Curators**!

## How do I participate in the Beatmap Spotlights League? {id=how-to-participate}

To be able to participate in the Beatmap Spotlights playlists, grab yourself the latest version of the [osu!(lazer) client](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download).

Once you're done installing and logging into your account, head over to the `playlists` tab in the `play` section and find the Beatmap Spotlight lobbies, denoted by a little green `Spotlights` indicator. You can also toggle the filter to show only Beatmap Spotlight playlists in the top-right corner.

Changing game modes is as simple as clicking one of the four mode icons at the top left of your screen — it'll be whatever game mode you played last on osu!(lazer) by default.

Once you have submitted a play on any of the beatmaps featured in the playlist, you will be able to check your placement in the seasonal rankings, as well as enjoy your shiny assigned division badge on the top of your user profile.

Check out the respective game mode seasonal rankings:

#### Beatmap of the Season - Curators' Pick

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-08-22-beatmap-spotlights-summer-2025/2282492.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2282492#osu/4883166)

**[SOUND HOLIC feat. Meramipop - Koiiro no Yume (NekuMagetsu) \[lit120's Hard\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2282492#osu/4883166)**, created by [lit120](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3109248)\
*primarily suggested and described by [DigitalHypno](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4384207)*

This map is a role model when it comes to recreating the old map style we all know and love, which is why it was chosen as the map of the season!

The mapset as a whole is a tribute to a [2009 map of the same song](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/11426), and both difficulties offer a gameplay experience that feels both nostalgic and fresh at the same time, using similar rhythm choices and even some of the same custom skin elements. Despite being a tribute map, everything about it feels like an upgrade from the original, with clean patterns and hitsounds, more custom skin elements, and even a longer mp3 that features the full five minutes of the song.

In short, this is the perfect map to give you the purest osu! experience: chilling out and peacefully clicking circles to a catchy song. Have fun!

Fun fact: [Andrea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33599) nominated both the original 2009 map and this new 2025 map.

#### Beatmap of the Season - Curators' Pick

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-08-22-beatmap-spotlights-summer-2025/2347284.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#osu/5048624)

**[Supire - Dead Aire (Jayceko) \[Nwolf's & Jayceko's Inherited Misfortune\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#osu/5048624)**, created by [Jayceko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19951350) and [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766)\
*primarily suggested by [nevqr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14269506)*\
*described by [Yasuho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8458835)*

Let's all take a well-needed breather and go back to one of the greatest maps the [osu!taiko World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025) had to offer. Of course, we are talking about [Supire - Dead Aire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2347284#taiko/5048624) mapped by [Jayceko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19951350) and [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766), this year's Quarterfinals tiebreaker.

Amazing design and song meets beatmapping extraordinaire — a collab we didn't know we needed. The techy mapping style is greatly supported by this song's neurofunk atmosphere. From start to finish, players receive plenty of difficult snapping and slider velocity changes and a custom song experience that can very easily cause goosebumps. Also remember to turn on the storyboard by [binarie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15632854) for the full experience.

What are you waiting for? Make sure to go play it if you haven't already! And if you have... PLAY IT AGAIN!

**[IOSYS - Chanteikku Sanyousei no Itazura Daisensou (Spectator) \[Rocma's Rain\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2281583#osu/4879141)**, created by [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276)\
*primarily suggested and described by [Morusya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13681464)*

Summer looks to have been a plenteous one for osu!catch. And what could be better to kick off the seasonal spotlights with than everyone's favourite IOSYS? Of course, a [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) map to boot!

Rocma, better known by their complex and technical maps, continues to surprise us once again, this time in the minimalist area. Their map for [Chanteikku Sanyousei no Itazura Daisensou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2281583#fruits/4879141) is an excellent demonstration of how even with a simplistic approach, one can create a rather interesting and fun map. The unusual usage of playfield and standstills create an exciting experience for fans of reading and control maps that you don't want to miss!

This Rain difficulty is sure to appeal to both new players who are just learning osu!catch and Spotlights veterans who can demonstrate their high level of play with additional mods!

*primarily suggested and described by [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785)*

This season, we are thrilled to highlight a remarkable [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) created exclusively for the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_7K). Composed by the talented [technoplanet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/193) and brought to life through the expert mapping of [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), one of the community’s finest 7K mappers, this masterpiece stands proudly as our Beatmap of the Season.

Prepare for an unforgettable challenge! This chart delivers a perfect harmony of rice and long notes, combined with unconventional, high-intensity patterns that will keep players engaged from the very first note. It demands physical precision, technical mastery, and impeccable coordination. A true test for anyone aiming to conquer its most intricate sections. As the music builds toward its epic final climax, the map transforms into an immersive journey, each note meticulously emphasizing the song's story and emotional progression.

We are beyond excited to present this beatmap as the highlight of the season, confident that it will deliver an unparalleled gameplay experience. Join us in celebrating this original creation, and show your support for both the map and its stunning soundtrack, crafted exclusively for osu!.
