As the year draws to a close, it's time to celebrate the season of joy and togetherness with a fanart contest!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-11-14-winter-2025-fanart-contest/banner.jpg)

Colder days and rising festivities set the perfect stage for osu! art connoisseurs to showcase their creativity and...

**Draw any of the osu! (or community) mascots in a winter theme or setting!**

We return to a broad theme for the winter season, and also to the early contest time frame like years past (wow, Halloween was just two weeks ago!).

The winter season also comes with frigid weather and snowy landscapes, unless you live on the flipside of this big blue marble of ours. The same applies to the theme of your drawing: if it's plausibly winter in your drawn scenery, you're good!

If the broad theme makes you short on ideas, don't worry! In these art contests, there's no such thing as art block. If you are somehow in possession of an art block, throw it away and replace it with one of these art ideas:

- Yuzu impressing everyone with his ice skating skills.
- pippi cozying up with hot chocolate during a snowstorm (and procrastinating on winter homework).
- Alisa knitting everyone plush toys of themselves.
- Mari out-fireworking Mani with the cooler-looking fireworks on New Year's Eve.
- Aiko rolling up Chirou into a Chirou-sized snowball.
- The osu! cast around a campfire on a quiet winter night.
- Mocha inviting everyone to a Christmas turkey dinner... or fried chicken... or to see a weird straw goat... or whatever people do for winter festivities.

Feel free to use these ideas or bring your own, or mash some together or extend others (also known as brainstorming).

If you're wondering who these mascots we're always talking about are, check no further than the [wiki](/wiki/Mascots). If you're feeling curious but know little about anyone other than pippi, our main poster girl, [Mocha](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/mocha/Mocha_Documentation.pdf), [Yuzu](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/yuzu/yuzu-hq.pdf) and the pair of [Mani and Mari](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/mari-mani/MariMani_Documentation.pdf) have design reference documents you can check out (by clicking the links in this sentence)!

## Rewards

As tradition dictates, we're providing a handsome suite of rewards to complement your frosty artworks:

- A selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu** and receive **3 months of osu!supporter**.
- The top 3 will receive fancy bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations.
- The top 4 will be featured as [**limited-time selection of default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations).

Speaking of profile banners, be sure to nab any of the existing (and short-lived) [Halloween 2025 Fanart Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-09-19-halloween-fanart-contest) banners before they disappear forever!

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Winter 2025 Fanart Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it's your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** Otherwise, it's not an osu! contest, is it?
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** In a time that is traditionally associated with joy and celebration, the vibes need to play the part!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw or trace someone else's work.
- **Generative art programs or methods (such as AI) are NOT allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We will know if you do this. If we somehow miss it, the community won't. Don't sully your legacy as an artist!
- **Participants must keep a full file containing all of their entry's layers available.** We'll only ask you for this if we think it's needed to ascertain any claims regarding plagiarism or the use of generative art tools. If you don't/can't provide us this within a timely manner when we ask, we'll have no choice but to pull your listing from the contest, sorry!
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to any corner of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536**. This is automatically checked via the website, and the contest listing won't let you submit an entry even if it's off by ONE pixel. Export your creations at the correct resolution!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** The circular spot in the middle shows where the main-menu cookie will be when inside the game. Factor this in when designing your piece, as anything inside it is likely not going to be seen. This doesn't mean leaving a big circular hole full of nothing in the middle! Be creative. *Make sure you don't leave it visible in your end result.*
- **Do NOT leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.**
- **If you're using characters from other intellectual properties, do so sparingly.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using excessive representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work — the contest is about osu! foremost, after all. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Got any questions, or any urgent matters that need to be looked at? Don't hesitate to [send Hivie a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) for any inquiries regarding this contest!

With all that said, it's time to lock in. Whenever you're ready, head over to the [Winter 2025 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/269) and drag-and-drop your entry into the box with the plus sign in it.

You may reupload your entry to your heart's content if you want to make any adjustments, but you only have **21 days** to do so before the doors close off forever (4 December 2025, 18:00 UTC), so don't brood over how many snowballs to sketch in the background for too long.

Don't forget to also tag your social media posts with `#osufanart` for the world to see!

Best of luck with your festive creations!

—Hivie & Walavouchey
