Between Thursday and Sunday three weeks ago, osu!'s UK community put together a bunch of LAN setups, made a tournament bracket, and got ready for another round of the biggest UK meetup in Kettering!

The meetup between October 30th and November 2nd was announced [back in September](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-09-16-osu-uk-epic46). With the eventful weekend now all over and all of the attendees comfortably sipping tea at home (or so one would presume), this is where you can read about how things went!

If you're not an avid reader, no worries. Here's the social-media-length highlight reel:

## Taskmaster

One more event was in store: [chromb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10238680)'s "osu! Community Taskmaster", where members of the osu! community were spurred into completing various tasks both online and IRL, such as:

- Recreating an iconic osu! background using any means
- Recreating osu!'s theme song "nekodex - circles!"
- Make the best looking toast

The final round was held on the venue's main stage, in preparation for which the participants had to complete some tasks during the LAN! [ilw8](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14167692) ended up winning the round, congrats! (The overall winner is to be determined.)

## Other fun stuff

So many things happened that warrant mention, even if we don't have footage of everything:

- [fudge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11592896)'s swift hands won at the PC building speedrun booth with a time of 7.801 seconds!
- There was a pub quiz full of unexpected shenanigans with team *kettle eggs* dominating the show (at least among the osu! participants).
- Watch parties for the ongoing [osu! World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025) were set up at various points during the event, even with a screen atop a trash bin right before leaving the venue.

... and that's just the tip of the iceberg (people did make one).

Meeting the people we've gotten to know online never fails to remind us of how tight-knit the osu! community really is. Thank you everyone for attending and to the production staff for tirelessly making these experiences happen!
