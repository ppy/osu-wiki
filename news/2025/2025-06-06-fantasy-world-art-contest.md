Join us on a fantastical adventure where rhythm, art, and magic converge!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-06-06-fantasy-world-art-contest/banner.jpg)

As the summer solstice draws near, so does the time for our seasonal art contest! Let's see how our resident osu! artists make the most out of their creative juices under the intense heat of the sun — or cold, depending on the hemisphere.

This would be no fun without some theme to go by, however. This time around, we're asking you to...

**Draw the osu! mascots exploring a fantasy world!**

Swords and magic, castles and dungeons — pippi, Mocha, Yuzu, Mari and Mani have suddenly been transported to an unknown world! What kinds of adventures await them, and will their travails ever lead them home?

With that kind of setting, we'd be surprised if many ideas don't come to mind already. There's a whole world of them after all!

- pippi and Mocha browsing a forest flea market for fairies and wisps.
- Yuzu and Chirou ~~getting lost in~~ leisurely exploring a labyrinthine dungeon.
- Taikonator and Don requesting apprenticeship from a mythical colossus.
- Don and Mocha opening a potion shop.
- pippi and the crew receiving an invitation to an elven tea party.
- Mani and pippi braving tempestuous mountain trails.
- Mari diligently studying grimoires while Mani falls asleep trying.
- Chirou struggling to defeat a cute (definitely not bad) slime.

As long as your drawing has any kind of *fantasy* element, you're good!

## Rewards

Unfortunately, participating in this contest won't magically transport you to the fabled osu!verse, but it'll still give you opportunity to score some pretty sweet rewards!

A selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu** and receive **3 months of osu!supporter**, plus the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations, alongside being featured as  [**limited-time selection of default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations)!

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Fantasy World Art Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it's your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** Otherwise, it's not an osu! contest, is it?
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** Everyone from all age brackets deserve to enjoy our mascots, after all.
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw or trace someone else's work.
- **Generative art programs or methods (such as AI) are NOT allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We will know if you do this. If we somehow miss it, the community won't. Don't sully your legacy as an artist!
- **Participants must keep a full file containing all of their entry's layers available.** We'll only ask you for this if we think it's needed to ascertain any claims regarding plagiarism or the use of generative art tools. If you don't/can't provide us this within a timely manner when we ask, we'll have no choice but to pull your listing from the contest, sorry!
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to any corner of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536**. This is automatically checked via the website, and the contest listing won't let you submit an entry even if it's off by ONE pixel. Export your creations at the correct resolution!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** The circular spot in the middle shows where the main-menu cookie will be when inside the game. Factor this in when designing your piece, as anything inside it is likely not going to be seen. This doesn't mean leaving a big circular hole full of nothing in the middle! Be creative. *Make sure you don't leave it visible in your end result.*
- **Do NOT leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.**
- **If you're using characters from other intellectual properties, do so sparingly.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using excessive representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work — the contest is about osu! foremost, after all. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Got any questions, or any urgent matters that need to be looked at? Don't hesitate to [send Hivie a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) for any inquiries regarding this contest!

*Many thanks to [leeian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12595640) for cooking up some dedicated art for this contest's banner!*

Got all that? Time to lock in and head over to the [Fantasy World Art Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/249) as soon as you finish up your entry and drop it there. You may reupload your entry as many times as you need for any adjustments, but you've got **20 days** to do so before the doors close off forever (26 June 2025, 18:00 UTC), so don't brood over which line to re-colour for too long!

Good luck with your quest, traveller!

—Hivie, RandomeLoL, & Walavouchey
