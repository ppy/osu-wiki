Autumn leaves fall fast, but 'Quick Play' is faster (at least, in theory). Say hello to osu!'s brand-new matchmaking system!

The demand to add a "matchmaking" system to the game has not gone unnoticed. Rising popularity on some community solutions such as auto-hosting bots and full-on external matchmaking services have only reinforced this idea.

As of the late October osu!(lazer) update, it's finally our turn to try dabbling in a similar system, official and integrated within the game client. It was named about as fast as it was made: [quick play](/wiki/Gameplay/Quick_play)!

We hope you'll join over the coming four weeks for a system stress-test, with the addition of over 250 new maps (including mods) to the pool, global rating [leaderboards](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/quickplay/osu/1), beatmap selection voting, and more. Of course, the team will also be participating!

## But what exactly is quick play?

For those who still haven't checked the latest update video, here's a quick rundown of what quick play is by the hands of [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) and [smoogipoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1040328) — the minds behind quick play as a whole!

Quick play is an attempt at branching out into more ways for players to play and compete in the game. As opposed to solo leaderboards and [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) which allow players to compete in a global environment, quick play offers a much more direct approach to competition, by facing players against each other to test their mettle! In turn, quick play allows players to measure their skill relatively to their peers, while providing a much more direct way to interact with the community — not dissimilar to how multiplayer lobbies work.

The name of the game lies in its name: *quick* play! The system aims to provide a very casual experience for players who just want to hop into a lobby and get into the nitty-gritty of things. No need to create a lobby, wait for players to join, wait for everyone to ready up, and manually rotate the host between players. You get the same experience at a much quicker and steady pace from a selection of pre-curated mappools across all game modes!

More about the project's inner workings can be found in the [wiki article](/wiki/Gameplay/Quick_play) for the curious.

## Quick play launch event

The system has been live for a month, but we haven't made a huge deal about it (apart from mention in the lazer video and release notes).

In an attempt to get more players to try out quick play, we've planned four weeks of test runs. During each of these four weeks, we will test various iterations of how the system could be used, listening to user feedback and watching system metrics along the way.

Each week, the matchmaking system will switch between **1v1** and **free-for-all (FFA)** battles, and map pools that are either **manually curated** or **randomised** across *all Ranked Featured Artist beatmaps*:

| Dates | Pool type | Matchmaking type |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| December 6th – December 13th | Manually curated | 1v1 |
| December 13th – December 20th | Featured Artist | 1v1 |
| December 20th – December 27th | Manually curated | FFA |
| December 27th – January 3rd | Featured Artist | FFA |

While the manually curated pools are an expansion of the existing pools players have been able to play so far, we also want to experiment with pseudo-randomised pools constructed from the [Featured Artist beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?c=featured_artists&s=ranked) to add a discoverability aspect to the system, and potentially improve replayability for some users.

## The future of quick play

The evolution of this system rests in your hands! While it's still in its early stages, the team is actively reading your feedback and trying to figure out what works and what doesn't.

More importantly, it is worth mentioning that even though we just released this system, there is an ongoing effort to rapidly shape it into something **more competitive**, which will be coming online in the coming months. While these initial tests will allow us get a small glimpse on how players feel about the current system's core ideas, don't get too settled as there are large changes already in the works!

Big thanks to everyone who has already tried out this new feature. Also let's not forget the people in the map pooling community who took on the task of curating the selection maps. Or the community designers that stepped in and helped shape the UI/UX of the system.

For those who are willing to provide feedback, you'll be able to find a dedicated [`#quick-play`](https://discord.com/channels/188630481301012481/1440912440224120882) channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) as well as a [discussion page](https://github.com/ppy/osu/discussions/35506) in osu!'s GitHub repository.

Stay tuned for more announcements, changelogs, and news about the system in the coming weeks.
