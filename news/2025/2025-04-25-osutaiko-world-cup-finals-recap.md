With the two teams in the winners' bracket having already secured their podium placements, only one precious spot in the Grand Finals was left for the 4 lower-bracket line-ups to fight over. After Saturday's matches, it came down to a climactic match-up between the powerhouses of Chile (#6) and Taiwan (#5), fresh off confident 7–3 victories over the United Kingdom and China respectively. The stakes were simple: win, and you reach the osu!taiko World Cup 2025 podium.

Taiwan's ban was interestingly [BilliumMoto - Sentinel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354654#taiko/5069626) (HR2) despite their strong history on the fast HR slot, likely a result of Chile's intimidating 3.06 million team score in their previous match. Chile responded by banning [Ludicin - Signal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354876#taiko/5070177) (NM6) into the very tech-oriented Taiwan squad, followed by a pick of [cosMo@Bousou-P feat. HARU - LowSpeed Fake Lyric](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354609#taiko/5069510) (FM2)... that led to a quick break point from Taiwan! ::{ flag=CL }:: [ulko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669)'s 99.6% HD full combo on the brutal antimod wasn't enough to hold the pick, but ::{ flag=CL }:: [chibamasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16067522)'s 99.48% run on [TOMOYU & Supire feat. RIHINA - greenREgeneration](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354626#taiko/5069549) (HD1) stood tall above the rest to put Chile on the board with a counter break on Taiwan's first pick.

After staving off a huge second half comeback to take Chile's second pick of [cosMo@BousouP feat. Hatsune Miku - DeroDeroDeroDe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317287#taiko/4962143) (HD2), Taiwan finally broke the break streak with a dominant win on [hugepulse - Kaitei Gensou Toshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1955875#taiko/5069532) (NM7), with ::{ flag=TW }:: [HarryAda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12892087) narrowly missing out on a 99.5% full combo that would give the winners' bracket a run for their money! Chile held on with three amazing HDHR scores on [Umeboshi Chazuke - Galaxy in Toybox](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/559156#taiko/1182564) (FM1) to make it 2–3, Taiwan printed a point from the polyrhythmic [KERO - Color Printer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2167213#taiko/4572334) (HR1), and Chile kept up on [KNOWER - Time Traveler](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354840#taiko/5070071) (DT1) by way of not one but three full combo near-misses on one of the week's toughest maps.

Now up by a score of 3–4, Taiwan seemingly found an extra gear that Chile couldn't quite seem to match. Two full combos on [Spire of Lazarus - Big Hat Logan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354620#taiko/5069531) (NM5) with an unreal 3x100 from ::{ flag=TW }:: [HarryAda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12892087), three scores with one combined miss on the highly stressful [Amanogawa Converter - Never play me](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354618#taiko/5069528) (NM4) for one more break point, and one tightly contested, high-accuracy battle on [Rahatt - Gunoi Chop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354610#taiko/5069511) (NM1) later, team Taiwan had done it.

With a huge 7–3 win over a terrifying opponent in Chile, a team that still deserves huge congratulations on their best finish ever at 4th place, Taiwan came out on top of the brutal Finals lower bracket, advancing to the Grand Finals.

## Score highlights

In a later stage like the Finals, there is no avoiding scores that seem absolutely inhumane to a spectator. For players who have never played osu!taiko themselves, and even for players who are longstanding members of the community, some of those scores are incomprehensible.

- One of those scores last weekend was the unreal double S score from ::{ flag=JP }:: [_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196) on the very experimental and difficult NM2 pick, [Terminal 11 - Echoes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354615#taiko/5069524). The Japanese player has outscored every other player in their match against South Korea with zero 100s and outstanding gameplay.
- It takes a lot of confidence and practice to pick any mod on an antimod pick, but to go all the way with **two** mods and scoring a full combo despite this... definitely deserves a mention. This is exactly what ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910) did. Both of these players have not missed a single note in [cosMo@Bousou-P feat. HARU - LowSpeed Fake Lyric](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354609#taiko/5069510) (FM2), and thanks to the godlike accuracy of 99.60% on ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027)'s side, South Korea won the pick.
