The 29th cycle of the Community Mentorship Program is upon us! Get ready to delve deep into the world of mapping, modding, or storyboarding.

The Community Mentorship Program serves as a place for upcoming mappers, modders, and storyboarders to develop their skills under the guidance of more experienced members in the community. If you've ever found yourself wanting to expand your current knowledge, this might just be the opportunity you need.

Over the course of a cycle, you'll have the opportunity to learn from your mentor, participate in various mentorship events such as speedmapping contests, organise guest difficulties for your mapsets on our job board, and more! 

On the public side of things, [our Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Ft2FtXmBgx) offers general mapping discussion, feedback channels, the guest difficulty job board and more! We also announce mapping opportunities for tournaments and other relevant events on the server. If you happen to be running an event that you feel is relevant, feel free to reach out to the [Organisation Team](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dVbDmk2Z6RsosS8rN11cfjCPMLKMuCjrICOVqTW2KH4/edit?usp=sharing)!

If you're experienced in mapping, modding, or storyboarding, and have a desire to take those who are new under your wing, then consider joining us as a mentor! In the [forum announcement and rule thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2027351?n=1), you'll be able to apply right away. If you're only just getting started and are eager to hone your skills, then signing up as a mentee might be what you need!

For this following cycle, the timeline is as follows:

If you are a mentor or outside party interested in running or trialling a new event on the server, feel free to reach out to us!

If you or a friend are curious about the rules and which mentors you can apply for, please go to our [forum announcement and rules thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2027351?n=1) for more information.

We're looking forward to the mappers, modders and storyboarders of tomorrow!
