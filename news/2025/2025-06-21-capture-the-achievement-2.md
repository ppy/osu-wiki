The first iteration of [Capture The Achievement](https://cta.sheppsu.me/) received much positive feedback and helpful criticisms. We're now back with a second iteration that's bigger and better! You can check out teams and achievements related to the previous iteration [here](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/1).

**Capture The Achievement 2** is an event where teams of 1–5 players compete to complete as many "achievements" as possible. Achievements are like medals: they have a completion requirement, sometimes hidden, sometimes challenging. The event will start with 10 achievements and a new one will release every 4 hours, totalling 100 achievements across 15 days. Then there's one extra day to do a final grind for points. You don't have to be active the entire event — you can simply play whenever.

For specific details, please check the [CTA website](https://cta.sheppsu.me/). Join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kuE5mTZgqK) for announcements or if you have a specific question.

## How do I participate?

Go to the [CTA website](https://cta.sheppsu.me/teams), log in with osu!, and hit the register button. Once registered, you can create a team, join one, or be a free agent. 

If you pass screening, you'll be able to participate.

## What if I can't find a team?

No worries! Everyone who registers is a free agent by default, meaning you'll be automatically assigned a random team when the event starts. You can also opt out of being a free agent and play solo if that's your thing. 

## What does an achievement look like?

An achievement has a title, description, tags, and possibly one or more beatmaps. You can also see how many completions it has and how many points it's currently worth. The red border means your team hasn't completed it.

Many achievements are riddles involving obscure osu! knowledge. This is where you and your team pool your heads together to investigate where the answer lies, until a brainwave appears that allows you to connect the dots.

The solution to this particular achievement is playing [Super Mario Bros Medley](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1281#osu/11517), a map that got both [WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) and [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983) into osu!, as explained by their comments under the map and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T5F0Zzy6ps) from Doomsday's YouTube channel.

If you click the dropdown, you'll see who on your team completed the achievement. You only need one person on a team to complete an achievement.

### Competition achievements

Competition achievements are special types of achievements that have their own leaderboard and reward more points depending on your placement. These ones can be re-completed by any player on your team if it improves the old completion.

You can see your team's placement alongside other teams' placements, but you won't see their names until after the event ends.

## How does it work?

Once the event starts, you'll see a progress bar and submission button. Clicking the submission button tells the server to check if you've completed any achievements. 

![Completion progress and submission example](/wiki/shared/news/2025-06-21-capture-the-achievement-2/example-4.png)

The server checks your recent scores in all modes and your user profile. The server also utilises private in-game chat channels for some achievements (marked with a "chat" tag), which can be completed without submitting.
