## Format changes

For this year's 4K MWC, we've decided to retire the dedicated Slider Velocity (SV) slot. This means you won't see any dedicated SV slots or SV patterns in other categories. It was a tough call to make, as we are aware of the large SV playerbase that looked forward to the map every week. This change is a result of many factors, which you can read in detail in the [MWC 4K 2025 Changes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALxnlQR4UKBCFw_m1YjD0j5yS33vTqnq-YcIp6_N38M) written by our head mappooler and advisor [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576).

With SV gone, mappool sizes and win conditions needed to be adjusted. The new arrangement means that the Round of 16 and Semifinals pools are a bit smaller, and the number of wins needed for those rounds has been reduced accordingly. Here's a table outlining the current bracket format:

| Stage | Win condition | Mappool size |
| --: | :-- | :-- |
| Round of 32 & Round of 16 | Best of 9 (first to 5) | 6 RC / 3 HB / 3 LN / 1 TB |
| Quarterfinals & Semifinals | Best of 11 (first to 6) | 7 RC / 3 HB / 4 LN / 1 TB |
| Finals & Grand Finals | Best of 13 (first to 7) | 8 RC / 4 HB / 4 LN / 1 TB |

On the staff side, we've added a new role: **playtesting managers**! They'll be in charge of keeping the playtesting process smooth and organised.

As always, for more details pertaining to the tournament, please refer to the **[osu!mania 4K World Cup 2025 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_4K)**.

## How do I register?

**[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/51)**

Please note that teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded. **The deadline for registering is July 31, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to submit yours before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu!mania 4K global ranking is #5,000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues while singing up, email [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh).*
