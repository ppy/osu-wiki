From the osu! World Cup's Finals mappool to our Featured Artist library, **XenjeS** is part of osu! until the end of time.

Ukrainian producer **XenjeS** found their start in a familiar fashion: they watched a YouTube video of someone playing [The Big Black](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41823) when they were a teenager, downloaded the game, and feel in love with the obscure musical niches that make osu! what it is.

Unlike most people however, **XenjeS** took their musical interests a step further by drawing inspiration from artists like [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) and [Getty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/128) to create their own aural creations in FL Studio. Nearly 10 years after this whole journey, **XenjeS** is here today as one of our Featured Artists!

Mappers are lucky today. They're getting both quality and quantity through **29** tracks offered on [**XenjeS**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/482)!

**XenjeS**'s presence reaches deep into osu!'s tournament scene. They've produced original tracks for the [Ukrainian osu! Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2050742), [3 Digit World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/3WC/2025), [COE 2025 1v1 Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/COE/COE_2025), and [Resurrection Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/RESC/2025), along with official projects like [A Labour of Love](/wiki/Contests/A_Labour_of_Love_Contest), [osu!catch World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025), and most recently the [osu! World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025) with *Inorganic Dystopia* below!
