The longest-running annual beatmapping contest for novice mappers, the Newspaper Cup (NPC), has closed its doors and is ready to present its winners!

[NPC 2025 kicked off back in January.](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-29-newspaper-cup-2025) It was originally a Chinese mapping contest to promote novice mappers, which had its first iteration in 2015. Throughout the past years, the Newspaper Cup has strived to encourage fresh bloods into mapping and find new talents across the entire mapping community.

This year, participants were able to choose from any track they liked from the [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) library. With a total of 79 entries across three tracks, the competition among new mappers has been *exciting*, to say the least.

Today, let's have a deeper look at the winning entries, and check out what the judges would like to comment about them!

### 1st place: [Camellia - Dance with Silence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374180) (mapped by [PEALEERD_TAK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6214002))

> 相当有表现力的一张图，对滑条的运用较为合适，且flow也很好，打起来比较舒服。(This is a map that expresses the music very well. The mapper managed to use the sliders in a fairly solid way. The map has nice flow and good playability too.)

—[Pata-Mon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6149313)

> I feel it's pretty fitting for the song overall. Patterns are fire and very well reasoned, and this is one of my favorite entry.

### 2nd place: [Eisyo-kobu - Faithtival](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374192) (mapped by [Mimosa M](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24010320))

> Extremely impressive entry with technically superb visuals and supremely consistent ideas and structure. This sort of map has been done (09kami, yf_bmp and a couple other entries in this contest) before but I feel some of the patterning explored here pushed it even further beyond the existing ideas. Great job!

—[Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119507)

> 好！(Great!)

—[Pata-Mon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6149313)

> Did very well in reflecting music elements, love the dense visual for the first half of the map and most patterns matched the music well, good work.

—[Luval](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22414293)

> Very cool map! I enjoy your kickslider usage for emphasis, and the entry in general is very clean looking. I really like how the map also changes style and uses different ideas throughout the song.

—[-kevincela-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/266596)

A side note that -YeLing- participated and winned the screener's pick at the [May 2025 Monthly Beatmapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-12-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2025) with the same song but in a quite different style. Both of the maps are amazing, so please do check [the other map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374132) out!

### 4th place: [Ludicin - Signal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374038) (mapped by [JukedEm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17387300))

> I think it's very good, with many patterns that match, such as being particular about the details, using symmetry, and combining shapes.

—[Satellite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1661227)

> Good map, don't have much to say about it.

—[Alty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16407988)

### 5th place: [linear ring - enchanted love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374228) (mapped by [Phten02](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16678364))

> Very interesting map! A great example of how to make a messy structure work even if I think it was a bit too messy especially with slider design at points. Also a very technically challenging song to map and you did a great job at rising up to that challenge.

—[Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119507)

> Pretty outstanding design among all entries, flow is good and visual style is clean I like it, can see this mapper is experienced.
