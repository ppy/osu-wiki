We made it through yet another earth orbit — happy 8th birthday to Project Loved!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

In case you're new to osu!, or have been dormant for the past 8 years, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to determine which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All the beatmaps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) of their respective game modes. You can click on the banners below for each pick to vote on the poll for that map, and there is a description underneath each banner written by a Loved captain. There is also a [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) as well if you want to view the polls directly. The voting stage lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote!

More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

As always, we'd like to thank all of you who voted in the August round! Results can be found below:

- [Results for osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2118257)
- [Results for osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2118256)
- [Results for osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2118255)
- [Results for osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2118254)

Before we move onto the picks, there's an important change to Loved maps that needs to be announced:

Following multiple discussions and an internal vote among the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), Project Loved team, and the counsel of the osu! team, **requesting beatmaps to be removed from Loved is no longer possible**. Furthermore, ranking exact copies of Loved maps (either as re-uploaded sets or guest difficulties) **is no longer allowed**.

You may find an explanation behind this change and a space to discuss it in [this forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2132780?n=1).

Let's move onto the picks now!

*description written by [Froslass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)*

Here's the Outstanding Oldies pick for this month, straight from 2010!

While this is his first Loved stint, [TKiller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/113027) is no stranger to the Ranked section, having a couple maps ranked back in 2010–2011. However, while this map wasn't ranked, it certainly gained some popularity due to its presence in the [osu! Stream Compilation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/25403#osu/86044). Being one of the later entries in the compilation, it was quite challenging for its time, even though it doesn't really have much of what players might call "streams" nowadays.

Still, it's a really good map for 2010, and showcases a style that seems to be lost in the world of modern osu!. It should be quite a fun experience! So, if you're into this kind of nostalgia-inducing ride, this one might be worth voting Yes on.

For this month's *Small Spectable* pick we got [Surassa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4916716)'s map of [Gufi - Paul](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1063644), a song very well known among the Hispanic community because this song is funny as HELL if you get it.

While this was, quote unquote, "speedmapped" by the mapper, the map is very satisfying to play. To put it simply, this map is as much as you can get when it comes to raw aim. It has a couple of death streams, but nothing you can't get by really.

If you like raw aim/consistency jump maps, this one is meant for you.

Go vote or you're \[redacted\].

For this month's Ranked Rejects, here's *Predation And Non Predation*, mapped by [Sagu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4556542), [Mithia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9748438), [nantokanaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15241257), [oatmilk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16516525), [Phten02](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16678364), and [Wien Margarete](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9334812).

I found this map through a recommendation by a friend when I wanted to play high-BPM burst-intensive No Mod 7★ maps, and boy, does this map deliver. With a plentitude of bursts, complex 1/4 rhythms, streams, jumps and everything in between, this map is a perfect pick for a NM5 slot in a tournament. It definitely shocked me when I saw it never got ranked, but hey, Loved is a chance for a leaderboard at the very least!

As a player, I definitely recommend checking this out and voting Yes. As a mapper, I'm just as surprised at this map's quality. So go ahead, check it out!

What you've all been waiting for... this month's *Gameplay Gimmicks*!!

*QUANTUM TELEPORTATION* by rustbell transforms L.E.D.'s track into a uniquely creative and satisfying aim challenge. Flowing patterns and inventive gameplay have cemented it as a classic tournament pick for the best players. Now, with its very own leaderboard, aim control specialists will finally get to battle it out for the top spots.

Just a beautiful day when rustbell is back in the Loved section, as well as you voting yes. ;)

Yeah...

This month's *Meme Monstrosities* pick is a classic to some and a cultural touchstone to others. I'm not sure I'd call it a disservice to nobodyknows+, the artist of the original song, but there's definitely something brewing here. Only the mastermind behind [Truly Truly Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/97595#osu/260838) and [A Kiss for the FLOWER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/79702#osu/222278) could have come up with this. The Loved section finally gets a revisit from one of its greatest minds, ryza (formerly known as Silynn). It's your chance to dive into 2010s NicoNicoDouga culture through this short, yet exhilarating, 8★ jump map.

Just like I'm sure whatever [this video](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm27743371) actually means has to be funny as hell, I'm sure you guys will vote yes.

This month's first *Wildcard* pick brings you all another banger from legendary mapper duo Sing and Axarious. *CROSSING DELTA* (coincidentally a collaborative song itself) can be described as a quintessential tech map, with impeccable structure, creative rhythms, and above all else, incredibly tough slider and circle tech patterns that demand your utmost control. This map is certainly no cakewalk, featuring zero breaks across its 3:34 runtime, but that makes it all the more rewarding to clear. This map has been a hidden gem in the graveyard section for years, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Shoutouts to [wobeinimacao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/350723) 🐐. He would have wanted you to vote Yes!

**OFFHAND STREAMS**

That's the name of the game when it comes to [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501)'s amazing map of [AVTechNO! (feat. Hatsune Miku) - boku-boku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1293146#taiko). While you immerse yourself in the catchy tunes sung by Miku, you can't help focusing even more on the deviously designed stream patterns. Although this map is filled with offhand patterns, this doesn't present as discomfort, and makes successfully hitting them very rewarding!

Having a leaderboard for this map would be very interesting, as putting mods on it isn't easy at all. If you want to have a challenge while competing with all the talented players on the leaderboard, don't hesitate to give this map a 'Yes' vote!

If you have been around the taiko community for some time, there's no chance you haven't seen or even heard of [7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7491106). At some point in history, this mapping powerhouse decided that making their own music for their own maps was easier than finding new tracks to map. [Bitch Gun](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1057703#taiko) is one of the results of said conclusion, and this resulting mapset has all the elements necessary to be easily identifiable as a 7_7 map. It even has a "nerfed" difficulty, to give you the illusion of free choice (you are playing a challenging map either way).

Amassing over 5K plays throughout the years, this mapset is a perfect candidate to receiving a leaderboard, but as always, the decision falls in your hands. Make sure to give it a chance, and as always, have fun!

Anyone familiar with [Salieri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11233651) would know about their high-paced mapping. [Gawr Gura - REFLECT (Assertive Hardcore Bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1695555#taiko) is no exception, featuring 170 double-BPM dump patterning that is dense yet comfortable. The catchy song and fun map combo certainly helped it grow in popularity over the last few years.

All in all, the beatmap presents a challenge to intermediate players new to this mapping style, but also presents an opportunity for veteran players to compete on the leaderboards. If you're a fan of this style of mapping, remember to vote yes!

Would you take a look at what we have here! This name should be familiar to everyone.

[Konpaku Sariel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533502) has cemented himself as the go-to mapper when it comes to challenging maps. Many of you may not know this, but [Yuki Onna](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/720163#taiko) actually comes from Konpaku's signature tournament — [the Taiko Nightmare Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/973121?n=1). The main gimmick of the tournament was its win condition: miss count. Though with maps like *Yuki Onna*, this was no easy feat.

Don't even think about singletapping this map, it won't work (I've tried ☹️). Being 400 BPM basically throughout the whole map, alting is a must. This map has everything: speed, monos, finishers with the same color as the note before (*yikes*), or even mania diffs! (ew mania). But that's what makes this map so special! The set also offers some easier diffs if you don't like speed or even if you just don't want to put up with Konpaku's *angelic* SV choices! I still remember when I got my first pass on this map, and now you can try passing it too! All you need to do is vote yes!

A bonus tip for later: if you ever encounter a Konpaku map with the diffname *Angel*, **RUN**, or face the challenge head-on! ;)

This month we have [USAO - INSANE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2261830#fruits), featuring a lot of gimmicks coming from a new mapper you probably haven't heard much about.

While USAO may need no introduction, welcome [Rektydios](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13645370) to the stage, with his assortment of 1/8 snaps and precision patterning that remind me somewhat of a GiGas map on steroids. There really is a lot of excellent ideas in this map, and the gameplay was polished by Trent a couple months ago because he saw the potential in this map to be a really good tech/gimmick challenge.

Enjoy.

It's time for a runback.

[Kuzino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/158552)'s [Holy Moon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/34729#fruits/112852) stands in the osu!catch mapping world as an artifact of olden times. Dating back from 2011, at a time when only 2 osu!catch maps were ranked, it is a testament to its era — very tight and uncomfortable spacings, precise timings, awkward old patterning, and lower AR making most of the difficulty of the map. Back then, alongside other 4Q maps by Kuzino, it stood as one of the biggest challenges a map made specifically for the game mode could offer.

7 years later, in April of 2018, *Holy Moon* was put up as a Loved pick, but failed the voting. Back then, it definitely wasn't one of the more popular Kuzino maps, but that was about to change.

A few months later, *Holy Moon* would make an appearance in the Finals mappool of [CWC 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2018#finals), as an old-style No Mod challenge — and a challenge it truly was. Even the very best players at the time struggled to achieve single-digit miss counts, despite the map's low star rating. Being played during that CWC, up to the Grand Finals match that saw China crowned for the last time since then, turned this lesser-known Kuzino map into arguably their most legendary work to date.

Now, in 2025, enough time has passed. With this map being now more iconic than when it failed the vote, we believe it deserves a second shot at the Loved category. So, what do you think? Cast your vote by clicking the banner!

Most osu! players recognize our Featured Artist [LeaF](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/73) for her unique music style, often associated with [Aspire](/wiki/Contests/Aspire) projects that challenge mappers to create unconventional beatmaps.

This 2018 mapset also features an Aspire-styled difficulty by the host [Sakary](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2984583). Its creative patterning and experimental approach make it a perfect fit for the Loved section!

On top of that, the set includes a full spread of difficulties, offering plenty of fun and interesting patterns.\
osu!catch players will also recognize the guest mappers instantly — this mapset is stacked with some of the biggest names of the game mode!

Fun fact: while Sakary has contributed guest difficulties to 6 Loved mapsets, none of their own sets have made it into Loved. Now's the time to change that!

*don't say "Loved" for 24 hours challenge*

Alright.

[Promachos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14069486) has been prolifically known for providing not only [compelling and playable storyboards](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2022456), but also contributing to a number of [high-profile storyboards for presentation purposes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2432016). Their map available for voting this month is *not* one of those.

*dont say "i can sample that" for 24 hours challenge* is a rather flamboyant and raw display of Promachos' capabilities. From what I know and remember, I believe they maintain their own Python scripts to generate timing points and transitions for SV, which I think is really cool... but also hell to maintain. Anyways, the result is really flashy and honestly a blast to showcase at your local talent show. If they still do these nowadays.

Do YOU want to showcase this map at your local talent show? Please go ahead, vote 'Yes' in the associated thread and get this map to Lov— AGH

[hugepulse - Swim in the sea of quarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1544189#mania) by [11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526)\

When you hear [Swim in the sea of quarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1544189#mania), you can kind of expect to see a chart that goes really fast, and [11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526) showcases how it can be done.

It first throws you off with an extremely fast jumpstream section, having numerous anchors and also one-handed trills, making for a very uncomfortable and challenging experience. Once that's done, you already have a chordjack section, and polyrhythms as well to go with it. The thing about this chart is that there's really so much going on, and with how fast everything's going, you really are in for an experience that can make you struggle, should you find fast charts difficult.

Once the break section's finished, you are then greeted with 30 seconds of non-stop jumpstream barrage, with the same anchors and one-handed trills that you have seen in the first half. By this point, a lot of your stamina may have already been drained. Fundamentally, this is an extremely difficult chart, simply because it's not just testing how fast you can go, but also how accurately you can execute these patterns without getting extremely tired, or rushing the patterns and sacrificing a lot of accuracy.

[11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526)'s charts have really a lot to display for players, giving for unique experiences all throughout. [Swim in the sea of quarks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1544189#mania) really gives a perspective on how difficult their charts can be, and I can't wait to see how everyone performs on the different rates that are present in this chart. Let us explore the sea of quarks together, and vote "Yes" for this chart!

[HAARPER - DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT! (Prod. Luga)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1849165#mania) by [Jhown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14772488)\
133.6 – 183.7 BPM, 2:45 | 6.08★ – 7.96★\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Jhown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14772488) has been a staple in the chordjack scene, and [DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT! (Prod. Luga)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1849165#mania/3798609) has certainly gained a lot of attention.

What makes this chart so difficult in the first place is how dense it is. Anchors can go for as long as 5 notes, and with the numerous amount of quads and hands that are thrown at you, it's certainly going to prove as a tough challenge for those unprepared. Did I forget to mention that you will be playing these at **167 BPM**? Both density and speed are certainly going to be aspects that will be tested on this chart. The only upside is that there's a few breaks in between the kiai sections; however, with how fast your stamina can be drained, these breaks will be the only moment where you will be able to breathe properly and (sort of) recover your stamina.

If 1.0x too fast, luckily, there are rates down to 0.8x. However, with how good the playerbase is nowadays, I won't be surprised if even the 1.05x and 1.1x leaderboards will get really good scores all across the board. Overall, this chart can really test your chordjack fundamentals, just because of how the aspects of speed and density are tested at the same time.

With how the limits of the chordjack skill set are being pushed, seeing charts like this really intrigues me due to the prospect of players scoring very high on them. Not only that, but this really is a showcase of [Jhown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14772488)'s charting, and with over 30,000 plays, there's definitely a demand for charts like these. If you agree, don't hesitate to vote "Yes", and give Jhown another step on the Loved stage!

[0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707) is making their second appearance in Loved, and this time around they're bringing us [INSANE INFLAME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1671838#mania/3860131)!

At first, *0DZ0*, or better known as DarkZtar within the *FlashFlashRevolution* community, didn't have much of a presence within osu!mania, but as of recently, has gained much more traction due to ranking a whole lot of maps, alongside helping in multiple tournaments. *INSANE INFLAME* is currently one of their earliest uploads, as it was requested to be used in [Speed of Light 3](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2023)'s Round of 16 pool on a 1.1x rate, but has ended up being one of their more popular charts, despite still being in the graveyard after all this time.

For a tech chart, practically everything you'd find in one is thrown at you, with a heavy amount of longjacks and bursts, but perhaps the thing that makes this chart stand out is the very neat approach to the main wubs in the song, using snaps that make it feel both technically accurate and just flat out techy, with the added graces adding a significant feel to song representation.

Overall, this serves as a great introduction to DZ's general approach to tech-y charts. Of course, there are always uprates for those who think 165 BPM longjacks are child's play. With that said and done, go vote!

I... I can explain.

[Amerom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5691061) is much, much more known for their playing over charting, but [Rainbow Rave Parade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1788538#mania/3664445) is... different. Being a collab with [Guilhermeziat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661387), it was made as a qualifier for [Torneio Brasileiro de osu!mania 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1567514?n=1), where it served as a hybrid, with... SV?

Despite how out of place that seems, it ends up playing absurdly well. A good portion of it doesn't use heavy SV, perhaps most notably the chordjack section, and the addition of SVs in the spots they are in only enhances the chart further. Unsurprisingly, there's a difficulty without any SVs, which still ends up playing like a standalone chart, but if you take the time to learn the tricky parts, it is so very worth it. If you make that choice, however, all I can do is wish you good luck on hitting the very first note.

It's truly a challenge to explain just how unique this chart is. It's heavily, heavily recommended that you give it your vote in the thread, and give this one-of-a-kind chart the spotlight it deserves.

*When Regulus is occulted by the Moon...\
When the silver disk and the white spotlight collide...\
And when the head and tail of notes combine...*

You have this, a poem with symphony and LNs. Although it's not the time where the Moon covers the star, being one of [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767)'s best-made LN maps, it's still epic everywhere, from the song to the layering and patterning. Feel the notes and streams with your hands, along with the song going up and down, along with every drum beat. You will find that you are not only playing the map, but also joining the symphony, the poem, the Moon and the star, with yourself!

This map is also featured in [SOFT6](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/6) as LN1 in the Quarterfinals. It examines the overall skill of your LN, from coordination to density, LN jacks and walls, to the epic trill buildup. It's not quite long, but it's unforgettable, and you might really want to play it for a second time!

Lastly, please vote if you enjoy this poem and the poet of long notes!

In this map, [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) carefully emphasised and distinguished the intensities and pitches of the vocals, creating a variety of LN and dump patterns that perfectly capture the essence of the music.

You may not realise this, but we love song collabs, not because solo compositions aren't Loved, but because collaborations tend to bring a unique experience that *just* isn't found in a song that was made by one individual. To share this "uniqueness", this month we not only have one, not two, but three different songs!! Each are composed by three famous artists who made their names well known in the Japanese music and anime spheres.

As odd as it sounds, this map was requested by one of [Arcwinolivirus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089)', or Arcwin's, Twitch viewers for an osu!mania mapping reward. It gained traction and popularity over the years due to the combination of his outstanding charting and the song's unique mixing (not to mention that it was also done with live mapping). This is a fairly casually patterned chart suitable for players at the "intermediate" 7K skill level!

The hybrid style of the map mixes a lot of very different skill sets, including but not limited to: rice physicality, LN coordination, full inverse, and releases, making it a hybrid fusion. The patterns are designed to be friendly and comfortable while not intrusive, making them suitable for a large audience. Whether you just reached the skill level for this chart, warming up for a key-mashing session, or *simply* just want to test your accuracy, this map is for you!

Arcwin has built an outstanding legacy in the mania community for over a decade, and he has made many, many fantastic charts for the community to enjoy! Please vote, vote, **voteeeeeee**!! Help support this chart and the mapper finally get its well-deserved place on Loved leaderboards!!

From all of us in the [Project Loved team](https://loved.sh/contributors), we hope you enjoy this month's selection and stay tuned for October! All the passing maps will appear in the [Loved beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved) shortly after the polls end.
