Favourites looked to assert dominance. Underdogs had upsets in their sights. From full combos, solo carries and last second lead changes to matches that included blowouts, nail-bitingly close battles, and everything in between, the Quarterfinals week of OWC 2025 had it all.

This week's pool was a mix of the usual and very unusual. Maps such as [Taeyang's map of *Remote Control*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351630#osu/774965) and [mizto's map of *Prismatix*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2294086#osu/4898892), mainstays in the top plays of many, contrasted with extremely technical or gimmicky maps such as [Pencilina](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/755651#osu/1590460) or [Haiboku no Altra Vita](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2412331#osu/5297696), the former a slider aim and precision pick in Hard Rock, the latter a Free Mod tech offering and a familiar map to those who kept up with [Locus](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025) earlier in the year, having placed second in that contest.

On the side of customs, a popular pick this week was [Rtyzen's Suminagashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465435#osu/5396931), a CS 5 AR 8 Free Mod pick on the shorter side, which ended up seeing plenty of extra Hard Rock mods by teams. [ULTRA RENDA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465421#osu/5396886), a reading-intensive nomod offering, and [Haunted Dance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465285#osu/5396555), a Hard Rock all-around challenge, were also hotly contested this week. [Previous CWC original *Side by Side*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465424#osu/5396889) and [China LAN original *On Seeking U*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2409840#osu/5232210) also blessed this week's pool with their presence.

This week had two [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) debuts as well!

And for the tiebreaker, a familiar face returned to osu!, as one of the earliest and most iconic Featured Artists, [Helblinde](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5), gave us a chilling yet epic song in [Nástrǫnd](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465411#osu/5396873), mapped by [funny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8473573), [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812) and [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) in a mechanically heavy, yet still distinctly technical way. Do check out the storyboard by [LowGraphics](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942) as well (maybe through the [commentary video below](#helblinde)), it's incredibly impressive!

### ::{ flag=RO }:: Romania vs. ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2625094523&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false&time=0h8m51s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

The story of Saturday was the #26 seed Taiwan and the ascension of ::{ flag=TW }:: [GAO HAO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8964050). An unheralded player to many coming into this World Cup, he would make himself into a household name over the course of Taiwan's shocking upset of #12 seed Romania in the losers' bracket round 2.

The match began inauspiciously with the teams trading picks for the first four maps before Romania stole a break point on Taiwan's 3rd pick of [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465285#osu/5396555), led by ::{ flag=RO }:: [origin_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15095811) and his 608,503 score. Romania consolidated the break point by dominating [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465435#osu/5396931) next for a 4–2 lead, after which the teams traded points with Romania taking match point advantage at 5–3.

At this point, it was do or die time for Taiwan, whose tournament lives were on the line heading into their final pick of DT1. On the iconic [Remote Control](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351630#osu/774965), they put together a strong overall team performance led by ::{ flag=TW }:: [Flyer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9767342) putting up a 906,008 score to win the map and force Romania into their own final selection.

[NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465419#osu/5396883) was their choice for their final opportunity to win the match outright. The Romanian roster for this map looked strong, led by ::{ flag=RO }:: [badeu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1473890), historically one of the best alt players in the world. However, ::{ flag=TW }:: [GAO HAO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8964050) had other ideas: he coolly and calmly dropped the only full combo on the map of the entire weekend, bringing the match to a tie and forcing the tiebreaker. The newly minted Taiwanese carry would continue his momentum into that tiebreaker, top-scoring [Nastrond](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465411#osu/5396873) with a score of 671,250 and leading Taiwan to an improbable victory, one of the largest seeding upsets in World Cup history.

---

While the remainder of Saturday’s matches were won by the higher seeds in largely straightforward fashion, two other matchups bear mentioning among the highlights of the day:

- ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil (#11) vs. ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland (#22) was a topsy-turvy affair in which Brazil jumped out to a 4–1 lead that Finland brought all the way back to 4–4 before Brazil took the final two maps for a 6–4 final margin of victory.
- ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada (#4) vs. ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany (#5), a matchup of titans in the winners' Quarterfinals, played out similarly, as Canada dominated the early stages of the match to take a 5–1 lead before a ::{ flag=DE }:: [criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659) masterclass on [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424357#osu/5276838) and [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465285#osu/5396555) notched Germany two further points, but Canada shut the door on their comeback attempt by eking out a 92,115 margin of victory on [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2412331#osu/5297696) to finish off the match 6–3.

## Sunday summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **Australia** ::{ flag=AU }:: | **6** | 2 | ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea |
| France ::{ flag=FR }:: | 3 | **6** | ::{ flag=NZ }:: **New Zealand** |
| **Poland** ::{ flag=PL }:: | **6** | 1 | ::{ flag=CN }:: China |
| Taiwan ::{ flag=TW }:: | 2 | **6** | ::{ flag=CL }:: **Chile** |
| Philippines ::{ flag=PH }:: | 3 | **6** | ::{ flag=RU }:: **Russian Federation** |
| **Norway** ::{ flag=NO }:: | **6** | 3 | ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil |

Sunday's slate featured the remaining two Quarterfinals matches and the losers' bracket Round 3 potential matches, in which LB winners from Saturday faced off for the remaining spots in the top 12. In the Winners side of the bracket, Australia sent the defending champions South Korea to the losers' bracket by a score of 6–2 including highlights such as [ASecretBox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7341183) and [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) dropping double FCs on [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2294086#osu/4898892) and FM4 with [palr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15429006) joining them for a ridiculous triple FC on [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465435#osu/5396931).

Following this, #1 seed Poland put on a clinic against China with a 6–1 victory in which they won each of their points by 400,000 points or more — though China stole the show with an [unbelievable team score](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2625999082?t=0h23m32s) on [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/755651#osu/1590460) that's a must-to-watch for all OWC fans.

### ::{ flag=FR }:: France vs. ::{ flag=NZ }:: New Zealand

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2625886328&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false&time=1h7m15s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

In the losers' bracket, the highlight match featured the New Zealand roster on a quest to make a name for themselves in OWC taking on team France, looking to overcome their demons of the past with a new-look squad. It was a surprise to many to see New Zealand qualify as the #16 seed for this year's World Cup following a placement of #44 in 2024 and an early exit in 25th–32nd in 2023, but those keeping close tabs on their roster knew they were on an upward trajectory and that they were capable of proving their Qualifier placement was no fluke. Their opponent in this year's losers' bracket Round 3 was seed #15 France, a team with a lengthy history of mixed results in OWC trying to reach the top 12 for the first time since 2022.

France got off to an excellent start in the match, opening with a break point and consolidating on their first pick of [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2218922#osu/4703382), but New Zealand put the pedal to the floor and reeled off five straight picks to take a commanding 5–2 lead, banking multiple match point opportunities. While France was able to put another point on the board on [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/11558#osu/57382), New Zealand was not to be denied, picking and dominating [Remote Control](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351630#osu/774965) for a 6–3 victory.

It was the biggest win in New Zealand's OWC history, securing their first-ever place in the Semifinals week and with it their first-ever guaranteed top 12 finish, silencing any who may have doubted their potential following their Qualifier performance.

[Helblinde](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5), one of the first [Featured Artists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists), returned by producing [Nástrǫnd](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465411#osu/5396873) as the tiebreaker for the Quarterfinals.

As one of the earliest Featured Artists, I'm sure a lot of older players are very fond of your contributions to the game in the past. How is it for you being able to return after so long?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Helblinde.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5">Helblinde</a></p>

I'm incredibly thankful, I've mentioned it before but I used to use osu! back in 2008 to prepare for Counter-Strike tournaments and I've always had a strong connection to it. Even though I am quite an old man now, it was heartwarming to see that so many remember my songs to this day. To also end up with such an amazing art team and mappers made it even better, and now my goal is to get decent enough at the game again to be able to at least pass the tiebreaker. Honestly, it has made me want to put in a little bit more effort into music again, which I never really expected.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

When it comes to the production, you were given a pretty blank slate to make what you wanted. Is there any interesting details about the track, like easter eggs or references?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Helblinde.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5">Helblinde</a></p>

While I'm not going to name all of them, "oblivion calls you home" refers to the old track that was in the Aspire competition in 2016. I used some of the same synths that I did for that track, as a bit of a continuation of what was made previously. I basically leaned in to the past as much as I could, both for the sake of nostalgia and going "full circle". And of course mania had to be mentioned in there somewhere...

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

As a player yourself, you probably have a decent understanding about what type of music goes well with the gameplay. Do you ever think of existing maps you've played when trying to compose a song for osu! or have a vision for what the map might look like? What did you think of your experience collaborating with the World Cup design and mapping teams?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Helblinde.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5">Helblinde</a></p>

Absolutely, I had a clear goal going in but as per usual it ended up nothing like I originally intended. But I wanted to have a bit of variety, looking back I could have probably done a bit of a better job with that but honestly the mappers did such an excellent job. When the last full screen jump section came on I laughed a bit because that was partly why I made it pure 4/4 without a lot of distraction in the end. The collaboration was probably one of my best experiences I've had over the years, clear communication, taking my thoughts and feelings into consideration; and everyone being really good at what they do. It was so good that it invoked a feeling of wanting to collaborate more instead of going solo as I have for so long, so that's saying something.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

We're seeing more and more osu! players pick up music production and eventually become featured artists themselves. Is there any advice you'd like to give to those looking to do the same?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Helblinde.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/5">Helblinde</a></p>

Start small, build a small community of others that are in a similar position and grow together. If you try to reach out too far initially you'll put way too much pressure on yourself, and you need that tight-knit community group to help form each other and to be able to give good feedback. It's also way easier to take feedback from good buddies. If time allows, I've considered mentoring and building a foundation for new artists to have a good space to express themselves as I haven't found anything like it.

At some point you will find your little niche where you can start adding individuality to it, that's when it gets real fun. If someone out there is reading this and considering making music, I promise that you can. I have no musical background whatsoever, but I learned through observation, failing a lot, and loving the kick that music gives you. It's cliche but if I can do it, you can too.

When it comes to lyric-driven storyboards, few names stand out in the community quite like [LowGraphics](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942). Recognised for his visual storytelling through text design, LowGraphics left us a lasting impression with his work on [Lies Playing Truth](https://youtu.be/v5ZaTeibemI) in OWC 2024 and [Veil of Ash](https://youtu.be/1a8kmvlpSj4) in CWC 2025. We now see him making a return to take on the Quarterfinals Tiebreaker [Helblinde - Nástrǫnd](https://youtu.be/k0fRmaEWty8), a challenging dark mythological design rooted in Norse lore.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

Welcome back to storyboarding! Many in the community already recognize your name from your iconic lyric storyboards. For those discovering your designs for the first time, can you tell us a bit about yourself? How would you describe yourself as a storyboard designer?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/LowGraphics.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942">LowGraphics</a></p>

Hi there, I'm LowGraphics! I've been storyboarding since 2021, some of you may recognize the first project I ever worked on which was the [TUYU Songs Compilation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1382858#osu/3063448). Having no knowledge in video production or motion design, I thought it would be an interesting challenge to try to recreate their music videos. That took a year. But now, with last year's [Lies Playing Truth](https://youtu.be/v5ZaTeibemI), I somehow actually managed to make an actual music video within osu!, and I couldn't be happier with how my storyboarding career has gone.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

Your specialty lies in lyric storyboards. However, Nástrǫnd was a very different project. This song had less vocals and a heavy atmosphere. How did the absence of lyrics affect your approach towards planning the storyboard? What changed in your workflow compared to previous lyric-driven storyboards like [Lies Playing Truth](https://youtu.be/v5ZaTeibemI) and [Veil of Ash](https://youtu.be/1a8kmvlpSj4)?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/LowGraphics.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942">LowGraphics</a></p>

In lyric-driven storyboards, the animation of the text is usually the main selling point. With Nástrǫnd, what I usually rely on for visual flair just wasn't there. The lack of vocals shifts the focus entirely onto the atmosphere and narrative, which meant the animations had to carry the emotional weight of the song on their own.

We joked during planning that the whole storyboard was going to be themed around vibe, but in reality it was a huge challenge to meet that expectation. Because the track is so intense, it felt like every second needed to be a visual spectacle. Matching the feeling of the song is the main priority, and that was a very different kind of challenge compared to lyrical songs.

For some sections, we even had to work backwards. I needed to first imagine what kind of animation would suit the mood or energy, and only after figuring out the movement and pacing could we decide which illustrations or motifs best supported that idea. It was a new workflow for me, but also a really fun way to rethink how I approach storytelling.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

Helblinde introduced Nástrǫnd with the theme of harsh afterlife rooted in Norse mythology, giving the team full creative freedom to explore the theme. Did the freedom to explore such a grim concept influence the ideas you had early on? Were there any design elements that drove your decisions?

Having full creative control can be a blessing and curse at times. On one hand, you don't have to worry about what the musician envisioned things to be like, but on the other hand where do you even start with the planning?

For this particular song, the way Helblinde composed it just left me with such a strong mental image right away, I got chills the first time I heard it. It felt relentless, almost hallucinatory. And with that thought in mind I went straight to kaleidoscopes, where everything is centred, symmetrical and constantly shifting. Right away I knew I wanted the more intense parts of the song to feel like flicking through an endless series of hallucinations. When one of our illustrators drew an eye straight out of a horror scene, it fit the idea of Nástrǫnd so well I just knew we had to keep exploring more of this uneasiness.

It's always an inspiring experience to work with a large team where each role contributes a unique piece to the final production. What was the collaboration experience like for you? Has it opened up any new directions or ideas you'd like to explore in future designs?

As the title storyboarder suggests, it's my role to plan out how the song's narrative is told. I usually come in with references and rough visuals so the team can get a sense of the direction I'm imagining. But that has its own problem as I tend to think within the limits of my own experience, so my initial ideas can be a bit tunnel visioned.

One of the things that I absolutely love about collaborating is how naturally we bounce ideas off one another. Everyone brings something a little bit new to the table, and that back and forth always pushes the concept further than whatever we had at the start. If these projects have taught me anything, it's to trust the collective experience of everyone involved.

I honestly can't say enough about how lucky we are to have such talented designers on board. Collaborations always help to push ideas further, and the end product that the audience gets to enjoy is something that I'm always going to be proud to share.
