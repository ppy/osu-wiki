Having a total of **132** entries this time, our osu! resident artists have been busy creating a variety of fantastical worlds for our pippi and the gang to explore! Now, *you're* going to be tasked with an adventure of your own to crown the victors of this magical showdown with **15** votes!

Feeling overwhelmed with the sheer amount of submissions? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a slick slideshow showcasing every entry under the tunes of [Redside - Mainquest](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351091#osu/5059397) grabbed right out of the [5 Digit World Cup 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2028931?n=1)!
