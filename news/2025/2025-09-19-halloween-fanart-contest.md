After our little Autumn detour last year, it's about time we rejuvenate our eternal tradition of celebrating spooky month with pippi and co.!

It's been two years, but for veterans of this contest it should be a welcome return to tradition! Spooky month is back and that means harrowing menu backgrounds to mortify the playerbase for the next few months.

Warm up your drawing tablets and get ready to...

**Draw the osu! mascots in a Halloween theme or setting!**

Speaking of mortifying, we recently discovered a well, which at night emanates eerie whispers of hypothetical Halloween-themed situations our mascots could find themselves in:

- "Adventurer pippi exploring an ancient tomb together with a frightened Chirou and a lackadaisical Alisa."
- "Vampire Mocha laughing at us mortals from high, with the full moon's radiance proclaiming her presence."
- "Mani and Mari eating pumpkin cakes at a Halloween carnival, but the tables, chairs and tea mysteriously float away!"
- "Taikonator and Tama taking a part-time job helping to ferry spirits across a certain river into eternity."
- "Aiko and Yuzu flying on brooms between households for tricks and treats, filling up a cauldron of sweets that'll last them days!"

How mysterious. But also convenient! Feel free to pick any of these ideas as inspiration and start drawing. If none of them sounded impressive, then you too must have discovered a wellspring of ideas already.

Now, be careful while looking down the idea well. The void beckons, yet we wouldn't want anyone to fall in too deep. The silly and spooky kinds of horror are par for the course, but please go easy on gore and genuine scares. **Remember to read the [rules](#rules)!**

## Rewards

While your art may send shivers down our spines, the following prizes will surely sweeten the scare!

A selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu** and receive **3 months of osu!supporter**, plus the top 3 will also receive fancy bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations, alongside the top 4 being featured as  [**limited-time selection of default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations)!

Speaking of banners, make sure to nab any of the existing [Fantasy World Art Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-04-01-springtime-showdown-art-contest-results) banners before they disappear forever!

## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant us permission to use your artwork in the main menu client should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and the contest (Halloween 2025 Fanart Contest).** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it's your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST follow the contest theme and contain AT LEAST one of the osu! official or community mascots.** Otherwise, it's not an osu! contest, is it?
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** Keep the actual gore out of your art pieces! Some blood is fine, just be reasonable with it.
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw or trace someone else's work.
- **Generative art programs or methods (such as AI) are NOT allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you. We will know if you do this. If we somehow miss it, the community won't. Don't sully your legacy as an artist!
- **Participants must keep a full file containing all of their entry's layers available.** We'll only ask you for this if we think it's needed to ascertain any claims regarding plagiarism or the use of generative art tools. If you don't/can't provide us this within a timely manner when we ask, we'll have no choice but to pull your listing from the contest, sorry!
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to any corner of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **Entries MUST meet the resolution requirements for a main-menu piece — namely 2732x1536**. This is automatically checked via the website, and the contest listing won't let you submit an entry even if it's off by ONE pixel. Export your creations at the correct resolution!
- **Artists should use the custom templates provided ([PSD template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.psd?2017) / [PNG template](https://assets.ppy.sh/events/fanart/templates/osu%21%20main%20menu%202732x1536.png?2017)) when composing their piece as a guideline to understand where the osu! cookie will be placed on the main menu and during the voting process.** The circular spot in the middle shows where the main-menu cookie will be when inside the game. Factor this in when designing your piece, as anything inside it is likely not going to be seen. This doesn't mean leaving a big circular hole full of nothing in the middle! Be creative. *Make sure you don't leave it visible in your end result.*
- **Do NOT leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in your submission.**
- **If you're using characters from other intellectual properties, do so sparingly.** All the official osu! mascots and the community mascots are fair game, but please avoid using excessive representations of characters from other worlds or franchises in your work — the contest is about osu! foremost, after all. Remember also that the community mascots are someone else's treasured creation, so please treat them with the same respect that you'd treat your own OCs and work.

Got any questions, or any urgent matters that need to be looked at? Don't hesitate to [send Hivie a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) for any inquiries regarding this contest!

With all that said, it's lock-in time! Whenever you're ready, head over to the [Halloween 2025 Fanart Contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/260) and drag-&-drop your entry into the box with the plus sign in it.

You may reupload your entry to your heart's content if you want to make any adjustments, but you only have **20 days** to do so before the doors close off forever (9 October 2025, 18:00 UTC), so don't brood over how many bats to sketch for too long!

Oh, one more thing: if you're looking to showcase your work among the social media crowd, make sure to tag your posts with `#osufanart` for the world to see!

Good luck with your trick or treat quests!

—Hivie & Walavouchey
