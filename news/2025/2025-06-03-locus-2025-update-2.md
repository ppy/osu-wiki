It's about time for another Locus update — we are approaching the final stretch of the contest.

![](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025/img/banner.jpg)

In case you missed the previous news posts ([#1](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-31-locus) and [#2](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-04-14-locus-2025-update-1)) or have forgotten, Locus is a multi-layered contest launched in early 2025 to bring the creative circles on osu! closer together.

Firstly, due to a few organisational delays, **the final submission deadline is now extended to 30 June 2025 (12:00 UTC)**. This results in 1 more month for all teams to complete or polish their submission.

Registrations will continue to remain open until this new deadline. If you are interested in participating or have not yet registered a team, we highly recommend you read the [wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025) for more details.

With that out of the way, we have a few other important updates for you below.

### Teaser #2

Around mid-April, we sent an email to all registered teams to provide a short video (of their choice) to tease part of their entry again. With more footage this time around, you may get a better idea of what is to come during the actual voting phase:

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/2025-06-02-locus-teaser-2.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

There will be no more teasers after this! There's only 4 weeks until submission — it's the real thing after this.

Many thanks to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) who put everything together again.

### Submission

We have created the following checklist to ensure that your submission goes smoothly:

- Ensure that you have successfully registered a team, and that all your team members have confirmed their intent as well (if you have not received an explicit email confirming this, then this hasn't been done).
  - **Your submission will be ignored if you have not successfully registered a team.**
- Please read the [wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025) thoroughly to check that your entry abides by all the rules, especially the ones relating to spread and anonymity.
- Please use the [submission page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/238) to submit your entry as an `.osz` file before the deadline.
  - It is preferable that the team captain submits. Only one person from each team needs to submit (to prevent any ambiguity or confusion, please do not submit duplicates).
  - Do not submit your entry via BSS.
- As an optional precaution, please reply to the existing email thread to let us know that you have submitted your entry.

There will be a period of roughly 1 week while we manually check all the entries to ensure that they follow all the rules. During this vetting process, we will email teams to make corrections if we find any errors (we want to give all teams a fair shot without being overly harsh on simple oversights).

**Please be vigilant of your emails during this period (30 June – 6 July).**

After all this is completed, the public voting will begin at the announcement of the next news post.

### Trial voting results

On 16 March, we unveiled the [trial voting website](https://locus.yui.tv/) — a demonstration of the community voting system to be used in Locus. We asked the question:

> What was the best osu! original tiebreaker from the osu! World Cups?

After sharing the intermediate results in our [last update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-04-14-locus-2025-update-1), more people trickled in to vote. After **378** community votes, here are the results of the top 10:

![Locus trial voting leaderboard](/wiki/shared/news/2025-06-03-locus-2025-update-2/trial-leaderboard-final.png)

Full standings can be found [here](https://locus.yui.tv/leaderboard). In order to prevent any bias resulting from the order the votes came in, the final Elo values are the average of 1,000 randomised vote orderings.

We hope that you find these results agreeable. It is difficult to predict how many votes we will actually receive for the official voting, but we hope that this trial has given the community confidence in this experimental voting system. If you have any feedback, please let us know.

Many thanks to [Komm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7671790) and [Venix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631) for coordinating this.

That's all from us for now! The next time you hear from us, it'll be voting time! (early July).

**Announcements for the contest will be coordinated through the `#locus` channel on the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)**
