The day you've been waiting for has finally come: **ak+q** is part of our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/466/header.jpg)

**ak+q**'s blend of piano, orchestral, and electronic elements has been synonymous with the mobile rhythm game *Arcaea* for years, but you might've also heard it through collaborations in *CHUNITHM*, *Groove Coaster*, *Dynamix*, *Cytus II*, *Lanota*, *RESONARK*, *DanceRail3*, [*NOISZ STΔRLIVHT*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/286). Now that **ak+q** is a Featured Artist, that list has expanded to include osu! too!

**12** tracks are part of [**ak+q**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/466), each pre-timed so you can load up the editor and start mapping.

Need some convincing? Preview some of **ak+q**'s stuff for yourself:
