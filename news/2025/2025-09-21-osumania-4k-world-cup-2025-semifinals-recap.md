While the tournament enters its final spurt, we're steadily reaching the peak of osu!mania 4K competition. Join us, as we retell this week's epic, now with an extra side of jam!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-21-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap/banner.jpg)

Words alone cannot describe the excitement from last week's matches. Even though we already had close calls on the previous rounds, nobody could prepare anyone for what would go down during the Semifinals. For some teams, "threading the needle" would be an understatement of titanic proportions. And without wanting to spoil anything, those who've been keeping up with this weekend's matches know this is only the beginning.

For those who would prefer to avoid reading **2306** words (we counted them one by one), don't worry! As per usual, [Dynascape](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8784587), [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), and [akace100](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9308128) have hand-crafted their recap in video form for you — yes, you — to enjoy.

![Semifinals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-21-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap/mappool-sf.jpg)

While the Semifinals mappool may be the same size as last round, its difficulty sure isn't the same! On top of that, this round gave us a handful of [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music), which is something everyone — players and spectators alike — are always looking forward to. With that said, let's get into the regular highlights for this pool.

Beginning with [Frums - NEERWUISSALEARNTD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431980#mania/5298316) (RC5) by ::{ flag=US }:: [hi19hi19](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1014473), you likely already know what to expect hearing who charted this, especially if you're familiar with the song. With a BPM of 238, this chart contains a heavy amount of 1/4 streams with rather long anchors mixed in. These can quickly become an issue when you factor in the bursts intertwined throughout the chart. Given the unpredictable nature of the song itself, many players were sure to find misses where they least expected it.

Wrapping up the normal highlights, [Lime - Pixel Planet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2432101#mania/5298628) (LN2) by ::{ flag=US }:: [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811) was possibly the most unique LN density chart we've got during this tournament. Ignoring the difficulty name referencing [a song by the same artist that Toaph charted for last year's MWC](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2044115#mania/4266309), Pixel Planet contained a noticeable amount of 1/6 long notes throughout the entire chart. As weird as it may sound, it ended up working heavily in its favour, offering a unique, yet familiar approach that's to be expected of the density slot.

</div>

The regular highlights have been cut rather short, as this round gave us **three** entirely new [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music), the first of which being [Ruby My Dear - Saint Patron](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431994#mania/5298336) (HB3) by ::{ flag=SG }:: [Abraxos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5025064) and ::{ flag=TW }:: [\[Crz\]FolAH1217](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6232458). The HB3 slot has become quite notorious for being one of the most unique in each pool, and Saint Patron is here to set what is possibly the best example of what this slot has to offer. Being a spiritual successor of some sort to [Croque Monsieur A Disneyland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1272922#mania/26451250), it contains tight graces, unpredictable snaps, and just about anything else you'd expect from the slot. Thanks to the impressive graphic design by the hands of ::{ flag=MY }:: [Z419](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966), the map's experience has been bolstered by an amazing artwork that players and spectators are sure to enjoy!

[Marmalade butcher - SIX BILLION MNSN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2432002#mania/5298351) (LN3) by ::{ flag=ID }:: [\[Crz\]Crysarlene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871) was this week's second original track. As seen in every other World Cup this year, [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220) has provided us with yet another song! Taking up one of the two wildcard slots in the LN category, this map ended up on the more speedy side, with most of it snapped on 1/4 at an already high BPM. That's not even accounting for the occasional higher snaps used to match the guitar! All in all, it's certainly worth giving a try, especially with ::{ flag=GB }:: [Amphy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [hourius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298)' great work with the background. For those who wish to get more insight from the artists themselves, you'll like what we have in store for you at the very end of this post!

</div>

Last, but certainly not least, we were given yet another tiebreaker! [Kou! - Ankh Natron Collider](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2432016#mania/5298404) by ::{ flag=US }:: [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093), ::{ flag=CN }:: [V1do-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17527968), ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), ::{ flag=US }:: [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811), and ::{ flag=KR }:: [11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526) brought quite the... storm? Or should we say dust storm? Either way, this tiebreaker is quite the opposite to [Kou!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/383)'s [last original tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202823#fruits/4662299), with this year's being just as impactful. With Kou!'s very familiar song structure, this tiebreaker was without question able to bring out a ton of tough patterns, whether that be rice or long notes. Especially with the huge team behind it, with ::{ flag=IE }:: [naraicat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6419788) working on the illustrations, ::{ flag=CN }:: [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799) and ::{ flag=SG }:: [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991) working on the graphic design, ::{ flag=NL }:: [Promachos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14069486) working on the storyboard, and ::{ flag=US }:: [Secondoverthree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13432062), ::{ flag=ID }:: [LenLitchu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34098325), and ::{ flag=CN }:: [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) all working on the video, this chart, and *especially* the ending are more than guaranteed to give just as much of a shock as they'll give you a challenge.

## Semifinals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| Vietnam ::{ flag=VN }:: | 1 | **6** | ::{ flag=ID }:: **Indonesia** |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **6** | 1 | ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru |
| **Hong Kong** ::{ flag=HK }:: | **6** | 0 | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines |
| Canada ::{ flag=CA }:: | 3 | **6** | ::{ flag=TH }:: **Thailand** |
| **United States** ::{ flag=US }:: | **6** | 0 | ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **6** | 2 | ::{ flag=ID }:: **Indonesia** |
| Hong Kong ::{ flag=HK }:: | 2 | **6** | ::{ flag=TH }:: **Thailand** |
| **China** ::{ flag=CN }:: | **6** | 1 | ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom |

While the results here seem like sweeps, many of the points in these matches were decided by incredibly close score margins, which is something we've been seeing more and more in these later tournament rounds. To appreciate those individual score differences, we've [compiled the highlights below](#score-highlights)!

Before that though, we want to highlight potentially the closest match we've had during the weekend. Potentially the closest match thus far as well!

### ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada vs. ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand

**[You can view the match information here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119259424)**\

    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_D1ykDqzqE?start=27&end=233" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Both teams had good reason to be nervous about this match. With an 80% pick'em prediction rate, the favourite was definitely ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand, a powerhouse team that had an unfortunate early drop into the losers' bracket. They had a taste of the podium for the first time last year, and came into the tournament looking to repeat (or even surpass!) that feat. Nevertheless, ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada was not going to be a pushover, coming in hot straight from the winners' bracket, only sent down by the #1 seed of the tournament, China.

If Canada had an advantage, it was going to be in the harder slots of pool, and that's where the match started: Canada's pick of the incredibly technical [Frums - NEERWUISSALEARNTD](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431980#mania/5298315) (RC5). What a way to start the match, with a no-breaks gauntlet by veteran mapper ::{ flag=US }:: [hi19hi19](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1014473), full of trills, minijacks, bursts, etc. Just 130 notes in, one of those bursts caught ::{ flag=TH }:: [parponger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28098890) off-guard, giving a nice early lead to Canada. Turns out, they were going to need it, as Thailand's insane ratio caused the lead to shrink... and shrink... and shrink... until the map ended with a meager *785 point difference* — not comfortable at all!

Thailand responded with more rice, picking the jumpstream consistency [otetsu - Cosmos](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431981#mania/5298317) (RC2), where an eerily similar situation occurred. Thailand's amazing ratio slowly gave them the lead... until a singular break caused it to swing towards Canada. Then yet again, by sheer accuracy alone, their lead shrank... and shrank... and shrank... until the final seconds of the map, where it flickered constantly between the two sides! It was complete uncertainty, stabilising only after the last note was played at **just 75 (!) points** on the Canadian side!

Trying to keep the momentum going, Canada went for their protect, [Kikuo - Missing, Missing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431995#mania/5298337) (LN1), which unfortunately backfired due to their lower accuracy and all 3 players missing, giving a solid victory to the Thai players. They responded in kind with [Ponchi - Anemone feat. haxchi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431891#mania/5298080) (HB1), but this turned out to be much closer than they had anticipated, with a 6-way FC. Thailand's better accuracy, however, gave them the point.

The match now stood at 2–2, and Canada decided to go back to the technical rice picks with [Various Artists - Gekishou Infinity (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431821#mania/5297927) (RC6), a vocal dump map where their better consistency gave them the victory. But Thailand turned back to the LN picks, with ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) and ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) delivering a masterclass in [Camellia - The Cat Evolved Into The Microwave-proof Cat!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431872#mania/5298044) (LN4), getting the highest scores across all matches this weekend.

The Canadians attempted to beat them back on the speed pick [Falcom Sound Team jdk feat. Kotera Kanako - Senkou no Yukue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431984#mania/5298322) (RC1), but only found *themselves* taking the misses, losing a critical point. Their opponents capitalised on this win with [Lime - Pixel Planet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2432101#mania/5298628) (LN2), where ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) outdid himself with a phenomenal 1xGreat 996k score, the highest one of the weekend. Now at match point, Canada's last attempt was the chordjack pick [-45 - Midorigo Queen Bee](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431979#mania/5298308) (RC4): but ::{ flag=CA }:: [mae0149](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9188975)'s 997.5k (Score V1) SS wasn't enough to beat back Thailand's ratios and double FC, ending the match at 6–3.

Canada exits this year's MWC in 9th–12th position, beating last year's run. Thailand only seems to be getting stronger as the rounds pass, which they proved the following day with yet another impressive victory over ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong. They've also continued their victory streak by beating Chile in their first Finals match yesterday, and will be facing South Korea today (Sunday) at 11:00 UTC — good luck!

## Score highlights

The trend continues with the Semifinals having even closer scores than the Quarterfinals. At the same time, now that we are nearing the end of the tournament, we're getting fewer matches and scores are getting scarcer. For a final time in the recaps, let us take a look at the close calls we got to enjoy over the last weekend:

| # |  |  | Pick | Score diff | Pick by | Won by | Link |
| :-: | --: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Canada ::{ flag=CA }:: | ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand | RC2 | 75 | ::{ flag=TH }:: | ::{ flag=CA }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119259424 "Match history") |

| 9 | China ::{ flag=CN }:: | ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom | RC2 | 3,256 | ::{ flag=GB }:: | ::{ flag=CN }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119270323 "Match history") |
| 10 | South Korea ::{ flag=KR }:: | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia | RC4 | 3,368 | ::{ flag=KR }:: | ::{ flag=KR }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119268578 "Match history") |

For the first time during this MWC, we saw a score gap of less than 100 points! It was once again the Thai team taking that top spot on the leaderboard for close maps (for their third time in a row!). Will they be able to continue this going into the Finals weekend, or will we see a different team take the top spot this weekend? Is a score gap of 75 points the closest we'll see, or is that elusive single-digit score gap finally going to happen?

On the match of ::{ flag=US }:: United States versus ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile, we witnessed several personal highlights. ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) showed his perfect ratio skill, getting an unbelievable 999,511 score with only 23 Greats on [otetsu - Cosmos (feat. GUMI) (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431981#mania/5298317) (RC2), which was the highest score across all maps this round! ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) proved his dominance in hybrid and long note picks, as shown by his performance in [Ponchi - Anemone feat. haxchi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2431891#mania/5298080) (HB1). He got a 997,249 score, which was far beyond what other players were able to achieve.

Lastly, we may have the exception of exceptions. On [Camellia - Dans la mer de son (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2432008#mania/5298381) (HB2), where plenty of famous players failed, only a few players achieved perfect combo. Among those, ::{ flag=CN }:: [DawnX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8534840) got the highest score of 995,201, making it perhaps the most outsanding of the whole round.

As a bonus, we got to interview [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220), composer of *SIX BILLION MNSN* for the Semifinals LN3 slot. Their commitment to their work really shone through this World Cup, and seeing the community reaction seems to only have pumped them up!

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

How were you made aware of osu! prior to this commission? What were your initial impressions seeing users mapping and playing your tracks in a rhythm game?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Marmalade_butcher.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220">Marmalade butcher</a></p>

I've never actually played it myself, but I knew about osu! beforehand through social media and such, where I learned that Marmalade butcher's songs seem to be quite popular in this rhythm game. I never imagined we'd get an offer to make a song for the World Cup, though.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

Do you believe mapping in rhythm games is a good medium to reinterpret music through gameplay? Do you think this was achieved with SIX BILLION MNSN?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Marmalade_butcher.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220">Marmalade butcher</a></p>

I think so. My music is basically instrumental, so there are no lyrics or vocals. That's why I think it'd be awesome if people could discover new things or ways to enjoy the songs through rhythm game mappings and such. In terms of high speed and a massive number of notes, I feel the interpretation is very similar. Parts like the song's ending make you feel like you're actually playing along, which is really great!

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

After having seen the players and users' reactions to the track, are you satisfied with the result of the team's efforts?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Marmalade_butcher.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220">Marmalade butcher</a></p>

I'm satisfied! I'd be happy if you enjoyed it.

Lastly, would you say this has been a good experience thus far? From the commissioning process to seeing the results of everyone's hard labour, what have been your favourite parts of the process?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Marmalade_butcher.jpg')"></a>

It was a lot of fun! I'd love to write songs again anytime! I even think it'd be amazing to do a live show worldwide through osu! someday! I hope everyone looks forward to that day!

Honestly, it doesn't really sink in while I'm making it or right after I submit it, but seeing everyone actually play it, enjoy it, and get hyped up—that's the best part. Every single one of them has passion poured into it! (I always pour passion into them!) If you keep playing and listening to the songs even after the World Cup ends, that would make me even happier!
