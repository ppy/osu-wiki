After the tournament's qualifiers concluded in December of last year, [21 different players](https://liquipedia.net/osu/KEL/3#Participants) (in addition to 11 invitees) got their chance to play against 11 top players that were invited to the event, all in a live setting, with a crowd of people!

All of this culminated in an exciting weekend in Gdańsk, Poland, where from Feb 8th–Feb 9th the community gathered, met their favourite players and content creators, and got the chance to witness top-tier gameplay live in the Kinguin Esports Lounge!

## Day 1

The tournament officially kicked off on Saturday 8th at 12:00 UTC with Round of 32, but players showed up early to get familiar with the space, get their gear set up, and prepare for the upcoming matches. The players were all situated in separate LAN rooms where anyone could walk in while they were warming up, but could also be closed off in order to allow players to concentrate on their matches.

While all that was happening, the production staff were getting ready to start the first stream of the weekend. Various camera setups for the audience and LAN rooms, the main stage audio and video, and the entire stream setup were all getting final touches after yesterday's preparations.

While major preparation already took place yesterday, there were issues here and there that kept cropping up, so the staff were on their feet the entire day making sure that all the players got a fair chance at playing without any technical difficulties, and that the stream ran smoothly.

Once everything was set up, the stream was started, and the Round of 32 commenced without any... major issues.

The goal for the first day was to have all matches between Round of 32 and Quarterfinals played out, which required immense effort on all sides to achieve. As for the matches themselves, the first part of the tournament was unremarkable in terms of matches, as most of them played out very one-sided, with a couple of exceptions.

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Rafis vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Michni (Round of 16)

The tournament may have just kicked off, but a clash of titans has already commenced! Just when everyone thought this Round of 16 wouldn't be that remarkable, ::{ flag=PL }:: [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Michni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3543130) made sure that wasn't the case! This was the first match of the tournament that went to tiebreaker, with both players consistently trading points throughout the entire match, not giving each other any room to breathe.

After much back-and-forth, ::{ flag=PL }:: [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) took the victory with the scoreline of 5–4, beating ::{ flag=PL }:: [Michni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3543130) on [Down - Kizan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2085347#osu/4368642) (TB), and secured themselves a place in the winners' bracket.

### ::{ flag=DE }:: Zeitfrost vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Kosiarek (Quarterfinals)

Right after the match between ::{ flag=PL }:: [Michni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3543130) and ::{ flag=UA }:: [RafGPio](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13705417) concluded, the casters jumped right into ::{ flag=DE }:: [Zeitfrost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11234706)'s and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Kosiarek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9086565)'s fierce battle for one of the last remaining spots in the losers' bracket, the winner of which would go on to face ::{ flag=PL }:: [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) in the Semifinals.

The cast kicks off at 2–3, with the players fighting it out at [LV.4 - Burning Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2095154#osu/4412694) (NM5), eventually leading to ::{ flag=DE }:: [ZeitFrost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11234706) winning the break point. After they failed to secure an early victory with a miniscule 35,000-point difference, the two would face off on the Quarterfinals tiebreaker — [Umeboshi Chazuke - AJITAMA Adventure OST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274953#osu/4847546).

In the end, ::{ flag=DE }:: [ZeitFrost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11234706) showed dominance and managed to slip into the Semifinals by the skin of their teeth with the final scoreline at 5–4.

With that, day 1 was concluded, and the production team along with the players that earned their keep in the brackets got their well-earned time to relax and rest.

## Day 2

Day 2 kicked off a bit later as the venue was only open to the public at 12:00 UTC, with matches supposed to be underway an hour later. As players rushed in to start setting up their gear once again, the organisers had already started preparations on their end as well.

With many lessons learned from yesterday, the latter half of the LAN was slated to run much more smoothly, and even have a 2nd stream running to allow for community members to catch any matches that didn't make it onto the main stream.

The matches themselves started getting more heated, with titans of the osu! community clashing live for the world to see, all hoping to snag themselves a top position. Ultimately, there was only one man who stood head and shoulders above everyone, acting as a final boss of the entire tournament — ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961).

### ::{ flag=US }:: im a fancy lad vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Rafis (Semifinals)

</div>

This amazing showdown was one of the two very last matches in the Semifinals, with ::{ flag=PL }:: [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) working overtime to kick ::{ flag=DE }:: [ZeitFrost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11234706) out of the bracket just an hour before, narrowly avoiding a tiebreaker scenario. Even though ::{ flag=US }:: [im a fancy lad](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4908650) had a slightly easier time with their first Semifinals match, it didn't mean this wouldn't be an extremely taxing match for both players.

At the beginning when both players traded points, it seemed as if this was going to be the first tiebreaker of the Semifinals. The closest map at this time was [JYOCHO - Kirei na Sankaku, Asahi Ningen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2108761#osu/4446255) (NM3) with only a 2,000-point difference in ::{ flag=US }:: [im a fancy lad](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4908650)'s favour.

::{ flag=PL }:: [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) had built up a slight lead in the first half, but started to lose momentum, and only won 1 of the 5 last maps. This gave ::{ flag=US }:: [im a fancy lad](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4908650) an opportunity to seize victory, which they ended up doing with a score of 6–4.

### ::{ flag=PL }:: milosz vs. ::{ flag=NO }:: NINERIK (Grand Finals)

</div>

This was it, this match would be decider of who gets get to challenge ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) in the Grand Finals. Both ::{ flag=PL }:: [milosz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13108233) and ::{ flag=NO }:: [NINERIK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10549880) are the crème de la crème that this game has to offer at the top 10 on the global leaderboards, not to mention being highly accomplished in the tournament scene.

The performance in this match was unbelievable, with neither player leaving anything on the table. You could feel the nervousness of the in-person spectators, with the tension being more palpable with every point. Both players had their moments of winning a couple of points in a row, the closest point being ::{ flag=PL }:: [milosz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13108233)'s 27,000 point win on [Camellia - Kono Hoshi de.... [Mega Mix] (20th Anniversary Remake)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2287988#osu/4881763) (NM6).

It would all culminate in a final showdown on [Camellia feat. Nanahira - Touryouka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1022167#osu/2138577), with ::{ flag=NO }:: [NINERIK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10549880) fighting for a chance at the tiebreaker. In the end, the winner was...

After all was said and done, no one was able to conquer the final boss, and ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) would be crowned the victor.

After dominating the bracket in its entirety (with ::{ flag=UA }:: [RafPGio](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13705417) being the only player to take more than 1 point from them, winning 3 points total), they would beat ::{ flag=PL }:: [milosz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13108233) in a convincing fashion, with a final score of 7–1.

A group photo was taken with all the attendees, staff and players, and that marked the end of the stream, and the 3rd edition of KEL.

Some fun was had after the fact, with ::{ flag=PL }:: [Graf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4448391) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) facing ::{ flag=PL }:: [WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Bartek22830](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6404027) in a 2v2 on nostalgic osu! maps, using insanely unhinged skins that covered the entire playfield. To add to the insanity, one player was aiming, and the other tapping!

Thank you to everyone who played, staffed, attended, and cheered the players on, both in person and online! On a personal note, I'd also like to thank the hosts — [flapczek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8210988) and [myksmyks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6840526) — for letting [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079) and myself in behind the scenes, and allowing us to run around with a phone taking photos and videos of everything. Next to that, thank you to [Daria Maria](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10806219) for letting me use their photos that they took during the event.

It's always great to see the osu! community come together and plan amazing events, and I can only hope we see more high-quality LANs just like this, and hopefully even have more news posts with IRL coverage.
