After one final hectic year of hosting 6 tournaments and a mapping contest between January to August, the Global Taiko Showdown tournament series is finally over on osu!
It has been a few months since we've finished it all up, but let's go through our last three badged events together, shall we?

## Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2025 Results

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-15-global-taiko-showdown-concludes/sgts_podium.png)

Let's start this off in one simple way: **Congratulations to Japan't on winning this final edition of the Squad Global Taiko Showdown, being the first ever non-fully Japanese team to ever win this tournament!** With this win, osu!taiko legend ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) also adds a new achievement to their already impressive track record: winning an edition of every major open-rank GTS tournament to exist! 

We cannot be forgetting the two other teams who complete the podium, however: **IAAI**, who led **Japan't** to a grueling **7-5** Grand Finals match and fell short of resetting the bracket to obtain their shot at winning the tournament, and **Haru no Tsuki**, who secured a third place finish after upsetting the third seed team in their last Finals match!

They have all shown some of the highest level of gameplay osu!taiko can showcase through a teams tournament format. Thank you all for playing.

## Mapping Global Taiko Showdown 2025 Results 

Let's now go to another spectrum of our online events, with the conclusion to our second and final mapping contest, with it seeing the team known as **唐揚げ弁当** take victory home, with **we go running** trailing them for second place, and **uhhasdl;fh ads;fhlasd;lhjg** securing a very respectable third place!

You can find the maps by all of these teams here down below!

The final GTS tournament finished with a podium of very familiar faces: players who sail from different horizons, yet would be recognised by anyone taking even the tiniest of interests in the osu!taiko scene. Let's kick things off with our heartfelt congratulations to ::{ flag=TW }:: [cheesestingy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16462012), the final GTS champion! Those who have indeed been paying attention might recognise him as the player who upset ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) in an EGTS2025 upper bracket match and exiting the tournament at top 16 (while the latter would later come painstakingly close to [winning the tournament!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes)). Flying in all the way from the Asian region, he showcased at the Dutch-based LAN event that his skills have only improved since then, for the pleasure of all those in attendance, and of those who couldn't make it.

We would also like to extend these congratulations to runner-up ::{ flag=US }:: [AuroraPhasmata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13664116), the defending champion from 2023, absolutely dominant in all 7(!) COEGTS matches he'd played prior to this year's grand final to defend his title, and ::{ flag=GB }:: [overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847), coming out of his 2023's playtesting commitment and overcoming some early stress and crankiness over the mappool to grab third place in the final day's first match. ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174), who barely missed out on a podium finish at 4th place, and whose performances stuck clearly ahead of everyone who didn't make it to the semifinals, clearly deserves a shout-out as well. These four players all proved their strength just as much as everyone else on COE's main stage.

## Original songs

As has become tradition with Global Taiko Showdown tournaments for a few years now, artists and lead GTS admin ::{ flag=FR }:: [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263) worked tirelessly and in unison to provide one final round of incredible compositions, each released for their own GTS-related event. We're covering only a handful of them in this news post in order to keep things short, but we heavily recommend checking everything out. It might take a while, but you won't regret it.

### Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2025

Each stage's Tiebreaker beatmap had its own composition, but we are only presenting two of them here. Do check the rest of them out!

#### Finals Tiebreaker

Legendary composer **[Hommarju](https://hommarju.wixsite.com/home)** launched an onslaught on the six squads who were still in the running during SGTS2025 Finals with their 5-minute composition **Deus Ex Machina (Final Attack Mix)**! Clocking at a 170-200 BPM range and an alarming 8 stars difficulty, ::{ flag=NO }:: [roufou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1109122)'s take on the song was played in the Upper Bracket's Finals match to decide the winner in an incredible 8-mod face-off!

- **[Check out the beatmap here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398669#taiko/5198457)**

#### Grand Finals Tiebreaker

Loved equally as he is feared by all rhythm games enjoyers, long-time featured artist **[Camellia](https://cametek.jp/)** returns for the third time to a GTS-related event! Drawing inspiration from his earlier albums, he worked towards nuturing a song that would serve as the final composition of the 2025 edition of SGTS... which blossomed into the behemoth that is **Paracausal Cocoon Protocol**. Ranging from 64 to a whopping **370** BPM, breaking through the 9 stars barrier at **9.23** stars, this titan of a beatmap hosted by ::{ flag=US }:: [SolaEclipse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6621158) is a collaborative work between 12 mappers whose purpose is to take down even the mightiest of players.

### Mapping Global Taiko Showdown 2025


MGTS featured a line-up of three songs, of which two had to be mapped. The contestants could tread down two different paths: take on **axis::BREAK** by **X/Y/Z** (a trio uniting the talents of **[Foodbot](https://soundcloud.com/foodbot)**, **[mrcool909090](https://soundcloud.com/mrcool909090)** and featured artist **[SiLiS](https://soundcloud.com/silis)**), or create something out of French duo **[Faxyne](https://soundcloud.com/faxyne)** and **[blobdash](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash)**'s composition, **Hatching**. In either case, they also had to tackle **ILLUSORYPROGRAM97**, a 5-minute collaborative effort between **[Kyotsugyon](https://soundcloud.com/kyotsugyon)** and **[Sh0wtime](https://soundcloud.com/sh0wtimelol)**.

### cavoe's osu! event's Global Taiko Showdown 2025

The 2023 edition of COEGTS already undertook the ridiculous task of having two mappools made exclusively out of songs composed for the event. The 2025 edition did it again, but because introducing all 26 songs would make this news post drag on for too long, only one song will be presented here: the final song released for a Global Taiko Showdown event: the Main Mappool Tiebreaker. Once again, we can only encourage you to support the effort of all of the artists involved in this gargantuan task by listening to their compositions and supporting them on their respective platforms.

#### Main Mappool Tiebreaker

**[REAL SHIT BASTARDS](https://soundcloud.com/realshitbastards)**, the duo unit encompassing the talents of **[4nzu](https://soundcloud.com/4nzu2)** and **[Supire](https://soundcloud.com/nh_supaia)**, undertook the effort of composing what would become an eight-minute long song which had to be the culmination of everything GTS-related. Under the direction of mappooler and set host ::{ flag=BR }:: [Ideal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3869519), 14 mappers were then tasked to make something out of that composition. The result is **MACHKINTV**, a 7.42 stars beatmap varying in styles coming from all over the world and ranging from 144 to 220 BPM. Mere words cannot describe this masterpiece of a song, so check it out yourself. Do not get jumpscared by the last few seconds, though. Do not say you were not warned.

## Best tournament moments

Every tournament has its set of memorable or funny moments, impossible comebacks, down to the wire matches. GTS tournaments this year were not spared of these: let's take a look at a few of them.

(yell at me (\_yosh) if i need to get the twitch links later, feel free to change things around i took the formatting for video files from a mwc recap newspost)

### Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2025

In an early round clash between the new rising stars sailing from Japan and veteran figures from the same country, team **WAKASA LIFE** looked to secure their third point on their NoMod 3 pick [Lawn Wake IX](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/966060#taiko/2691863) with a relatively comfortable 30k score lead, until ::{ flag=JP }:: [takumit25](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16662508) missed an entire pattern at the end of the map! This would have certainly be a turning point in the match for team **MANIERA**... if not for ::{ flag=JP }:: [kiyozi11](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9551196) trading some of these misses on a poorly-negociated snap change. While there were less misses, it was just enough to keep a **569** score difference in favour of team **WAKASA LIFE**, who went on to not lose a single pick for the remainder of the match.

Everything looked good for seed 2 team **IAAI** to secure their first pick on the Grand Finals NoMod 5 pick [Compute It With Some Devilish Alcoholic Steampunk Engines](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2403282#taiko/5212286)... until the client caught up, sending their narrow 353 points score lead over to team **Japan't**, with a final score difference of... **55**!

Our only in-situation Tiebreaker playthrough was during the first round of matches. Players ::{ flag=NL }:: [Cookie_Tree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/502722) and ::{ flag=FR }:: [Glassive](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12453848), respectively seeded 7 and 10, traded blow for blow on stage and then had one final showdown on [MACHKINTV](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2410842#taiko/5234943) to determine who would move on to the next set of matches and who would be eliminated from the tournament. After clawing back an initial 20k points deficit, ::{ flag=NL }:: [Cookie_Tree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/502722) eventually took the lead, but repeated misses traded by both players during a more technical section led to ::{ flag=FR }:: [Glassive](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12453848) claiming a more decisive advantage amidst the chaos later on. See for yourself.

::{ flag=TW }:: [cheesestingy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16462012) best showcased his HardRock proficiency by setting a seemingly otherworldly 7x100 full combo score on the HardRock 2 pick [The Ruthless Judgement by Mother Brain](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/5234914) against fellow Hard Rock enjoyer ::{ flag=GB }:: [overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847) in the Semifinals round to secure his matchpoint. The scroll speed increase added by the HardRock mod, on top of a mechanically-intense map clocking at a whooping *245* BPM, makes this the score of the tournament, beyond the shadow of a doubt. Don't believe us? Check the clip above.

<iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.twitch.tv/coevent/clip/CloudyEphemeralGoshawkKappaWealth-T1MIYGriAzHPauQI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In a neck-and-neck battle for the final podium spot, the eighth map of the match chosen by ::{ flag=GB }:: [overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847), [WE NEVER STOP THE BASS DROP (ft. Hanakuma Chifuyu)](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/5234373), featured as a Freemod 2 pick, saw a traditional HardRock versus Hidden battle against ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174). With a slight accuracy advantage, it looked like the American player would take the breakpoint, but a singular skipped finisher was just enough to be his undoing despite both players setting a full combo score on their respective mods, allowing the Northern Irish player to claim his fifth point of the match after dealing with the grueling 250 BPM section on HardRock at the end of the map. The score difference? **69**. Nice.

<iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.twitch.tv/coevent/clip/SourCrepuscularCamelItsBoshyTime-R6swqeJ-I2g_ZNKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Battling it out for the gold, ::{ flag=TW }:: [cheesestingy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16462012) and ::{ flag=US }:: [AuroraPhasmata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13664116) took their intense brawl to the NoMod 4 pick, [EMWEN](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/5234779). The defending champion eventually took his second point of the match, beating out his challenger's score by **a mere 1x100**... which came from the *very last note* of the map! Additionally, out of four picks by this point in the match, this was the third time in a row that both players scored a full combo at the same time, settling points on accuracy or mod difference on Freemod picks *alone*. If this is not an indicator of a good match, we no longer know what is.
