After one final hectic year of hosting 6 tournaments and a mapping contest between January to August, the Global Taiko Showdown tournament series is finally over on osu!
It has been a few months since we've finished it all up, but let's go through our last three badged events together, shall we?

## Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2025 Results

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-15-global-taiko-showdown-concludes/sgts_podium.png)

Let's start this off in one simple way: **Congratulations to Japan't on winning this final edition of the Squad Global Taiko Showdown, being the first ever non-fully Japanese team to ever win this tournament!** With this win, osu!taiko legend ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) also adds a new achievement to their already impressive track record: winning an edition of every major open-rank GTS tournament to exist! 

We cannot be forgetting the two other teams who complete the podium, however: **IAAI**, who led **Japan't** to a grueling **7-5** Grand Finals match and fell short of resetting the bracket to obtain their shot at winning the tournament, and **Haru no Tsuki**, who secured a third place finish after upsetting the third seed team in their last Finals match!

They have all shown some of the highest level of gameplay osu!taiko can showcase through a teams tournament format. Thank you all for playing.

## Mapping Global Taiko Showdown 2025 Results 

Let's now go to another spectrum of our online events, with the conclusion to our second and final mapping contest, with it seeing the team known as **唐揚げ弁当** take victory home, with **we go running** trailing them for second place, and **uhhasdl;fh ads;fhlasd;lhjg** securing a very respectable third place!

You can find the maps by all of these teams here down below!

The final GTS tournament finished with a podium of very familiar faces: players who sail from different horizons, yet would be recognised by anyone taking even the tiniest of interests in the osu!taiko scene. Let's kick things off with our heartfelt congratulations to ::{ flag=TW }:: [cheesestingy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16462012), the final GTS champion! Those who have indeed been paying attention might recognise him as the player who upset ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) in an EGTS2025 upper bracket match and exiting the tournament at top 16 (while the latter would later come painstakingly close to [winning the tournament!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes)). Flying in all the way from the Asian region, he showcased at the Dutch-based LAN event that his skills have only improved since then, for the pleasure of all those in attendance, and of those who couldn't make it.

We would also like to extend these congratulations to runner-up ::{ flag=US }:: [AuroraPhasmata](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13664116), the defending champion from 2023, absolutely dominant in all 7(!) COEGTS matches he'd played prior to this year's grand final to defend his title, and ::{ flag=GB }:: [overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847), coming out of his 2023's playtesting commitment and overcoming some early stress and crankiness over the mappool to grab third place in the final day's first match. ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174), who barely missed out on a podium finish at 4th place, and whose performances stuck clearly ahead of everyone who didn't make it to the semifinals, clearly deserves a shout-out as well. These four players all proved their strength just as much as everyone else on COE's main stage.

## Original songs

As has become tradition with Global Taiko Showdown tournaments for a few years now, artists and lead GTS admin ::{ flag=FR }:: [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263) worked tirelessly and in unison to provide one final round of incredible compositions, each released for their own GTS-related event. We're covering only a handful of them in this news post in order to keep things short, but we heavily recommend checking everything out. It might take a while, but you won't regret it.

### Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2025

Each stage's Tiebreaker beatmap had its own composition, but we are only presenting two of them here. Do check the rest of them out!

#### Finals Tiebreaker

Legendary composer **[Hommarju](https://hommarju.wixsite.com/home)** launched an onslaught on the six squads who were still in the running during SGTS2025 Finals with their 5-minute composition **Deus Ex Machina (Final Attack Mix)**! Clocking at a 170-200 BPM range and an alarming 8 stars difficulty, ::{ flag=NO }:: [roufou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1109122)'s take on the song was played in the Upper Bracket's Finals match to decide the winner in an incredible 8-mod face-off!

- **[Check out the beatmap here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398669#taiko/5198457)**

#### Grand Finals Tiebreaker

Loved equally as he is feared by all rhythm games enjoyers, long-time featured artist **[Camellia](https://cametek.jp/)** returns for the third time to a GTS-related event! Drawing inspiration from his earlier albums, he worked towards nuturing a song that would serve as the final composition of the 2025 edition of SGTS... which blossomed into the behemoth that is **Paracausal Cocoon Protocol**. Ranging from 64 to a whopping **370** BPM, breaking through the 9 stars barrier at **9.23** stars, this titan of a beatmap hosted by ::{ flag=US }:: [SolaEclipse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6621158) is a collaborative work between 12 mappers whose purpose is to take down even the mightiest of players.

### Mapping Global Taiko Showdown 2025


MGTS featured a line-up of three songs, of which two had to be mapped. The contestants could tread down two different paths: take on **axis::BREAK** by **X/Y/Z** (a trio uniting the talents of **[Foodbot](https://soundcloud.com/foodbot)**, **[mrcool909090](https://soundcloud.com/mrcool909090)** and featured artist **[SiLiS](https://soundcloud.com/silis)**), or create something out of French duo **[Faxyne](https://soundcloud.com/faxyne)** and **[blobdash](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash)**'s composition, **Hatching**. In either case, they also had to tackle **ILLUSORYPROGRAM97**, a 5-minute collaborative effort between **[Kyotsugyon](https://soundcloud.com/kyotsugyon)** and **[Sh0wtime](https://soundcloud.com/sh0wtimelol)**.

### cavoe's osu! event's Global Taiko Showdown 2025

The 2023 edition of COEGTS already undertook the ridiculous task of having two mappools made exclusively out of songs composed for the event. The 2025 edition did it again, but because introducing all 26 songs would make this news post drag on for too long, only one song will be presented here: the final song released for a Global Taiko Showdown event, the Main Mappool Tiebreaker. Once again, we can only encourage you to support the effort of all of the artists involved in this gargantuan task by listening to their compositions and supporting them on their respective platforms.

#### Main Mappool Tiebreaker

**REAL SHIT BASTARDS**, the duo unit encompassing the talents of **4nzu** and **Supire**, undertook the effort of composing what would become an eight-minute long song which had to be the culmination of everything GTS-related. Under the direction of set host ::{ flag=BR }:: [Ideal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3869519), 14 mappers were then tasked to make something out of that composition. The result is **MACHKINTV**, a 7.42 stars beatmap varying in styles coming from all over the world and ranging from 144 to 220 BPM. Mere words cannot describe this masterpiece of a song, so check it out yourself. Do not get jumpscared by the last few seconds, though. Do not say you were not warned.
