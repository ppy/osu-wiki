After one final hectic year of hosting 6 tournaments and a mapping contest between January to August, the Global Taiko Showdown tournament series is finally over on osu!
It has been a few months since we've finished it all up, but let's go through our last three badged events together, shall we?

## Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2025 Results

Let's start this off in one simple way: **Congratulations to Japan't on winning this final edition of the Squad Global Taiko Showdown, and in being the first ever non-fully Japanese team to ever win this tournament!** As a side note to this achievement, [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) has also won an edition of every major open-rank GTS tournament to exist with this final win. 

We cannot be forgetting the two other teams however, between **IAAI**, who led Japan't to a grueling **7-5** Grand Finals match, and **Haru no Tsuki**, who managed to obtain this 3rd place after upsetting the third seed team in their last Finals match!

Truly, they have all shown some of the highest level of gameplay osu!taiko can showcase in teams. Thank you all for playing.

The final GTS tournament finished with a podium of familiar faces, players who anyone around the scene would recognise. Firstly, congratulations to cheesestingy, the final GTS champion! Those who've been paying attention might recognise this as the player that upset kanten_07, who would later come painstakingly close to winning 2025's EGTS edition, in EGTS 2022's upper bracket, and flying out all the way from the Asia region, he showed on LAN that his skills have only grown since then.

Congratulations also to runner-up AuroraPhasmata, the defending champion from 2023, absolutely dominant in all 7(!) COEGTS matches he'd played prior to this year's grand final, and overdahedge2015, coming out from 2023's playtesting role and overcoming some early stress and crankiness over the mappool to grab third place in the final day's first match. An honorable mention should go to mBiscuit; even at 4th, his performances stuck clearly ahead of everyone who didn't make it to the semifinals, with the top 4 seeds all proving their strength just as much as each other on COE's main stage.
