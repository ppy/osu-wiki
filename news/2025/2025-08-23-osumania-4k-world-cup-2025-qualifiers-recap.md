The osu!mania 4K World Cup has officially begun. The rise of a new legend is upon us, so join us as our favourite teams begin their ascent to the very top of the podium!

MWC 4K is back in full swing for yet another year! With the staggering amount of **520 total registrations** and **38 teams**, this has quickly grown to become one of the most competitive years to date.

Despite some of the changes catching a handful of teams off guard, most players have been able to adapt rather quickly! And while we won't see the full extent of the changes until the bracket stages, it has been a great way to measure everyone's expectations.

Without further ado, let's get this week's recap started! We believe that many of you will find the Qualifier placements to be quite exciting.

And just like [MWC 7K's news posts](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-17-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-qualifiers-recap), we'll have weekly video coverage of the recaps by the hands of [Dynascape](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8784587), [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), and [akace100](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9308128). We highly encourage you give them a watch!

Starting the tournament off, we're given an ever so slightly different stage structure compared to last year, with the only noteworthy change being that the original stage 1, SV, has been removed. Every other slot remained the same as previous years, with the pool's size consisting of 7 stages instead of 8.

As for the highlights, a good start would be [Camellia - FM Synthesis Experiment (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2417719#mania/5256626) (HB1) by ::{ flag=US }:: [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093) and ::{ flag=CA }:: [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065). For an early-game hybrid, its approach differed a bit from previous years, with most of its difficulty coming from rice sections over long notes. That's not to say the LN department is lacking, however, as the most chokeable parts arguably lie within the heavy long note sections.

On the more LN-heavy end we have [Tanya Degurechaff (CV: Yuuki Aoi) - Los! Los! Los!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2417716#mania/5256623) (LN1) by ::{ flag=TH }:: [MyZterion-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723). Considering this LN coordination map's difficulty is akin to that of a mid-game pick, its patterns are definitely going to give a run for the players' money! Additionally, for those looking for an extra release accuracy challenge, there's an uncut version waiting for those who wish for an extra challenge!

For those unitiated on what LN Coordination is; LN Coordination is generally defined by high-tempo patterning primarily characterized by shields and decorated with LN flams, short bursts, complex staggered releases, and difficult one-handed patterning. This slot also typically tests consistency in LN patterning, as its physicality and technicality are fairly balanced.

Lastly, to round off the highlights, we've got [Creepy Nuts - Otonoke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2417729#mania/5256642) (RC3) by ::{ flag=PL }:: [Disguise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10764851) and ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576). Being a rather unexpected song for such a stage, it ended up working as a really, really difficult technical vocal dump chart. A far cry from what players would expect at a first glance! Without a shadow of a doubt, it is by far the hardest map in the pool. Players who wish to get a high-contending score can't allow themselves to be distracted while playing it.

## Qualifier highlights

After two days of non-stop lobbies, all 38 teams managed to finish their Qualifier matches in time. While the amount of teams has slightly decreased from last year, the competition remains just as thrilling — arguably even more!

![Qualifier results table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-08-23-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-qualifiers-recap/results-qualifiers.jpg)

The first seed caught everyone by surprise, with ::{ flag=CN }:: China performing almost perfectly throughout their qualifiers with all final scores being FCs! This otherworldly consistency alongside their great ratio lifted China far above and beyond their previous years. Following things up, the ::{ flag=US }:: United States managed to snatch second place by excelling in five out of seven maps. And while ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea met some trouble in a few maps, their ratio more than made up for it to remain in the seeding podium.

Subverting everyone's expectations, ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong managed to get their best placement up to date, getting seed 4 thanks to their overall score consistency. This got them 10 spots higher than last year! ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada managed to find their bearings as they squeezed into the top 8 spot. Meanwhile, the ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom and ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile traded places between seeds 5 and 6. And while ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand didn't get the best of scores, their improved roster is sure to make them a strong contender during the next rounds.

With more and more skilled players joining and returning every year, teams like ::{ flag=ES }:: Spain, the ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands and ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina all got a bump in the ranks. At the same time, ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia and ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru also did a good job against all odds. ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany, ::{ flag=VE }:: Venezuela, and ::{ flag=DK }:: Denmark all managed to climb up to the top 32, whereas ::{ flag=GT }:: Guatemala managed to qualify for their first time ever — congratulations!

Despite being eliminated, ::{ flag=UY }:: Uruguay and ::{ flag=LT }:: Lithuania were so close making it in! While they may've not qualified this year, they proved to be a force to be reckoned with. We hope they'll come back stronger next year.

Lastly, to get a better idea of each team's performances compared to last year, we've prepared a chart outlining each team's placements between 2025 and 2024 by their total score throughout the Qualifiers.

Many people underestimate how big of an undertaking preparing a tournament as the osu!mania 4K World Cup really is. Many of the challenges that the pooling team faces are transparent to the end user. As such, we wanted to interview a few key team members to give people a small glimpse into the work that goes behind running the tournament!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-08-23-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-qualifiers-recap/elexire.png)

[elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093) may not be as known as the other members of the pooling team, but their work is nothing short of impressive. Their tournament experience across multiple community tournaments did not go unnoticed by the rest of mappool selectors, leading straight to their addition to the team as of last year. Let's get their perspective working as a pooler as they begin to shape the osu!mania 4K World Cups of tomorrow!

Given your previous experiences, how do you think pooling for MWC differs from other community tournaments? What would you say you've had the most impact in? Lastly, are there any future goals, ambitions, or plans you or the team had in mind for the tournaments yet to come?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/elexire.jpg')"></a>

I must say, the overall process feels much heavier than any past tournament I've participated in. Possibly because, for the most part, MWC is the only tournament I've taken part in as a map selector, while every other tournament only had me as a mapper. Perhaps the closest thing I can compare it to was the first ever tournament I've helped in, [Speed of Light 3](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2023). With it being my first time helping with tournaments, I ended up doing quite a lot, such as being active in voice calls, and looking at how the entire pooling process went when it came to customizing the maps. I honestly don't think I could've been given a better first experience, I'm seriously thankful for everyone I met through it, and how it is what essentially spiraled me into where I am currently.

To go back to MWC, I find myself having the most impact in more "managerial" matters. Things like communicating with other mappers on where they stand or what they'd like to do, taking note of all slots currently occupied by mappers to prevent overlap, and other simple tasks such as giving a second opinion where needed. It's definitely not too much to look for, but the work allocation is seriously beneficial for all map selectors involved, playtesting managers included.

Personally, my goals moving forward would be to have more versatility, if that makes any sense. This kind of goes back to what I just said, as the range of what I do as a map selector is more focused on making things flow smoother, rather than directly monitoring where certain customs place. This weak spot of mine is definitely something I'd like to improve on for future years, and eventually into other tournaments as well.

Ever since they ranked their first map back in 2022, [V1do-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17527968) has rapidly made a name for themselves across the entire community. As they garnered more experience, they ended up giving tournament mapping a much deserved chance. Lo and behold, their efforts managed to bear fruit as they joined the mapping team in 2024! A true testament to their dedication to the art of mapping and community alike.

As a mapper, what do you find the most interesting about mapping for a specific tournament, let alone *world cups*? How was your experience mapping for Qualifiers this year, and how much different was it from bracket stages? As a recent addition yourself, do you have any suggestions for anyone whose long-term goal is to join the mapping team?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17527968" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/V1do-.jpg')"></a>

To me, tournament mapping has been the most interactive way of communicating between mappers and players. Every single custom map aims to create a challenging yet enjoyable experience for the players. Each tournament is a trove of new treasures, and I find the process of adapting to each unique playerbase very engaging and challenging.

This is no different with the osu!mania 4K World Cup — the pinnacle of all osu!mania tournaments. Your maps will be played by the most skilled and experienced players in this game. Regardless of the extra pressure, having the opportunity to create maps and be appreciated for it by players of this caliber must be the dream of every mapper. Knowing this, I work my hardest to be able to deliver my best maps. In return, I get positive praise that pushes me further in my mapping career, and nothing makes me this happy when mapping for tournaments.

Mapping for Qualifiers has certainly been a new experience for me. They're arguably the most important maps in the entire tournament given they determine the teams' seeds. The extra responsibility forces me to put in extra time refining the map, coordinating with the playtesters, and adhering to the poolers' expectations. Another significant difference is the cohesiveness required in the Qualifiers pool. Balancing difficulty across several different skill sets is no easy task after all. Thanks to our amazing team of poolers and playtesters, we were able to deliver this incredible Qualifier pool for everyone to enjoy!

I'm quite surprised by the amount of emerging mappers seen throughout this year, each one bringing something unique to the mapping scene. Those aiming for a spot in the MWC 4K, my best advice would be to be more active throughout the community. Mapping in multiple community tournaments, actively engaging with the playerbase, actively giving and receiving feedback, or even just actively playing the game. These are all good ways to evolve as a mapper while simultaneously leaving your mark on the community. Not only will this help you keep up with mapping standards, but it will also teach you the importance of pooling in tournaments.

The osu!mania 4K World Cup mapping team have been one of the best teams I've had the pleasure of working with, and I'm looking forward to seeing new faces making their way into the team in years to come!

Two-time MWC 4K winner for team USA and playlist winner extraordinaire, [mashu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12028216) has forsaken their right to play for the tournament to become a playtester for the second time in a row! Let us hear their thoughts after having been on both sides of the fence for so long.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/RandomeLoL.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063">RandomeLoL</a></p>

The transition from being a player to becoming a playtester must've not been easy. Have you been enjoying your job as a playtester, even if it meant waiving your right to play for the tournament? How important of a task do you think playtesting is when it comes to ensuring the quality of the pools?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12028216" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/mashu.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12028216">mashu</a></p>

Going from the mindset of a player to a playtester was quite a learning experience. As a player, it was more about maximizing scores, staying consistent, and taking note of strong and weak points on our matchups to know where my skill set would best complement my team's play. When I became involved in the process of playtesting, I'd learn that there were aspects of this role that were not very apparent to me beforehand. Coming from a player background, it quickly became one of the biggest hurdles I'd face.

Starting out in this role, just looking at a handful of maps really showed me just how different pooling can be from what I initially expected. It was less about how well and consistently you could perform on these maps, but more about how said map feels in the context of the tournament. Did the difficulty feel right? Does the map fit into its respective slot in its category well? Does it contrast well with other maps in the same category? These were questions we'd have to answer for each single pick that was ran through the team. Despite the challenges, I still found it very enjoyable to be involved in alongside the rest of the team to help bring tournaments like these to life!

As for how important playtesting is, I feel that it was as important as the rest of cogs in the pooling machine. The responsibility for this one gear lies in acting as a player for the tournament while providing feedback in a way that resembles the opinions of those who'll be playing it. This helps to evaluate maps from a plethora of perspectives with differing opinions. This is then used to finetune every single pick in the pool and make any changes accordingly to ensure its quality.

Despite playtesting being just as important as the rest of roles in the team, it is only thanks to everyone's collective efforts — not just the playtesters — that we were able to make these maps as fun and enjoyable as they are, both for players and spectators alike!
