The Mapping Global Taiko Showdown (MGTS) returns once again to bring avid osu!taiko mappers the opportunity to flex their editor muscles and stand their ground on who's the best out there!

## What's new?

While the contest remains single-round and team-based, we've lowered the team size from 4–6 players to just 2–3 to make the competition more accessible, and in classic GTS fashion, we're providing **three custom-made songs** to map!

Do note that you'll need to map exactly 2 of the 3 songs — please read the [contest's rules](LINK) for more details.

### Songs

This wouldn't be a GTS event without entirely original songs and beatmaps to accompany it, only this time of course *you* will be collaborating for the mapping part!

Check them all out below:

### (artist) - ILLUSORYPROGRAM97

## How do I participate?

First of all, joining the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/3mGC3HB) is mandatory for participation, because all important announcements will be communicated there.

Second, read the [contest's rules](LINK) carefully in order to understand the exact details of the contest's rules and procedures.

Your next step will be to form a team with 2 to 3 members, and have the captain [register the team in the GTS website](https://gtsosu.com/2025/mgts/home).

<MENTION REGISTRATION DEADLINE>

Once that's done, download one of the two beatmap templates below to start mapping:

- [Beatmap template 1: ILLUSORYPROGRAM97 + axis::BREAK](LINK)
- [Beatmap template 2: ILLUSORYPROGRAM97 + Hatching](LINK)

Make sure to update the beatmap creator's name to your team's captain's name in order to have a valid submission.

After you're done mapping, have your team's captain head over to the [submission page](LINK) to submit your entry.

If you're having any issues with the registration process, please don't hesitate to [send Hivie a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976)!

## Prizes

The top 3 teams that reign supreme will be awarded with the following prizes:

- **Contest points and badges:** These may be awarded after the contest has concluded (pending approval).
- **Ranked status:** The top 3 teams' entries will be fast-tracked to the Ranked section if the mappers choose to.
