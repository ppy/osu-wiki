Anyone who's paid attention to tournaments throughout the last few years has probably heard of **SiLiS**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-02-08-new-featured-artist-silis/header.jpg?1)

With a decade of experience arranging music for concerts and performing in local Chinese Orchestra groups, **SiLiS** has transferred his knowledge to the realm of rhythm game music production, having produced an ever-growing collection of [bespoke music](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) for osu!.

The Ranked section is no stranger to **SiLiS**'s work either, with maps like [Reminiscing Onward](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2241960), [GAME MAKE OVER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2123356), and [Isekai Magistrate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2262171) showcasing his talent.

Here's what you're actually here for: **23** new songs on [**SiLiS**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/434), each paired with a pre-timed beatmap template.

See what's in store for yourself:
