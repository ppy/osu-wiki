**MARETU** is a legendary name in VOCALOID, combining heavy metal, chiptune, and techno-pop to create incredible instrumental compositions. As our 504th Featured Artist, it goes without saying that his music is extremely suitable for osu!, already having been featured in mapsets such as [DeRandom Otaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5156153)'s one for [Umitagari](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/966574#osu/2023147). As one of the most popular VOCALOID artists in the world, **MARETU**'s music is now available for your circle clicking enjoyment.

**12** songs are a part of [**MARETU**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/504) for all your mapping needs!

**mimizu** is the second new Featured Artist. As one of the forefront artists behind the Kasane Teto revolution of 2025, **mimizu** creates fun, upbeat songs using Kasane Teto, our favourite VOCALOID gremlin. Known for incredibly catchy and fun instrumental arrangements, **mimizu** is no stranger to rhythm gaming. Heck, they have a whole song themed around taiko: [Tatakina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpHt9ys-6I8)!

**5** new songs are a part of [**mimizu**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/505)!

## Vocaloid Mapping Contest 3: SWAP//DUET

The [**Vocaloid Mapping Contest** (***VMC***)](/wiki/Contests/VMC) is back!

The last contest expanded the scope from just osu! to every game mode, and introduced the Vocaloid Appreciation Team's first Featured Artist addition of [iroha(sasaki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/399). Since it's been a while since the last event, you may wish to refresh yourself on the [outcome of the last VMC here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-04-07-vocaloid-mapping-contest-2-results)!

This time, the spotlight shines on **two Featured Artists**: **MARETU** and **mimizu**. Teams of two will work together across three unique phases — **PARALLEL**, **SWAP**, and **DUET** — to create the best VOCALOID maps possible.

- **PARALLEL:** Each teammate maps a different artist's song.
- **SWAP:** Partners swap songs and remap each other's picks with a completely new interpretation.
- **DUET:** Partners must collaborate directly to create a single cohesive mapset.

Full rules, judging criteria, and song downloads are available on the [contest wiki page](/wiki/Contests/VMC/3) and the [contest website](https://www.vat.gg/vmc3).
