There are two states of existence: one before and another after you've listened to **ZVLIAN**, our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/455/header.jpg)

**ZVLIAN** is an experimental electronic musician from Germany whose work masterfully mixes club-oriented beats and expressive soundscapes. Or in simpler terms, **ZVLIAN** makes awesome music, and we're bringing them to osu! because of it.

Totalling **12** tracks, [**ZVLIAN**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/455) is packed with pre-timed templates for some of osu!'s future tech mapping marvels.

Take some inspiration from a couple **ZVLIAN** songs that have already been translated into circles:

Honestly, there isn't much more to cover. [**ZVLIAN**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/455) has what you're looking for: `.osz` files for a bunch of cool songs. By the time you're done with these, they'll be `.osz` files with cool songs *and* cool circles/sliders.

As per usual, another artist is already on the docket for next weekend! Stay tuned.
