Today is the day your ears have been waiting for.

**Juwubi** is a Filipino producer and arranger with unlimited versatility. Any genre with `-core` on its end is within **Juwubi**'s wheelhouse, along with anything orchestral, rock-based, and whatever lands in between. In short, we think **Juwubi** is cool, and that's why they're officially part of osu!.

A set of **5** tunes have been added to [**Juwubi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/490), each pre-timed for your mapping amusement.

Words can't do this music justice. Experience it for yourself:

### [Juwubi - NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/490/UWU%20EP/Juwubi%20-%20NEVER%20GONNA%20GIVE%20YOU%20UP.osz)

[This map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2341735) hosted by [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929) was made specifically for this Featured Artist announcement, and [Kingling](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7010761) played it at [COE 2025](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event) specifically for this Featured Artist announcement!

There's more music to be found on [**Juwubi**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/490). Peruse as much as you need, then start your next map.

You know the drill by now. A new Featured Artist announcement is coming next weekend, so stay tuned for that (and probably another clip recorded at cavoe's osu! event).
