This osu!catch World Cup promises to be one for the ages, as many teams and players are returning and aiming for the top. It's also notably the edition with the most countries playing, with a grand total of 44 countries that competed for a spot in the Round of 32. The ones who qualified got to play this past week, so let's look at how that went.

The recent osu!catch World Cups have had a trend of mappools getting noticeably harder every year, and this edition is no exception. While still approachable for every team that qualified, some maps left even the most seasoned teams struggling to secure FCs.

One such example would be the second No Mod map, [Island of Orchids](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384624#fruits/5156307) (NM2) mapped by [Malai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4863096). Featuring very inconsistent and technical stream spacings and shapes, it ended up being one of the toughest maps this week and a testament to the rising difficulty of these mappools. The song also comes from friend of the community and Featured Artist [WangleLine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7994819), which we always love to see.

We also got to see some new names on the mapping side, with [Des9](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5404711) making his first CWC appearance on [Battle Junction -1209-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384629#fruits/5156313) (HD2) in collaboration with [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768) for the mandatory low approach rate Hidden pick. [-Hex-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8630988) also joined the team with [Vitalization](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384668#fruits/5156387) (DT1), a comfy but still challenging consistency map.

As a novelty, a specific non-custom map was featured in the pool for the first time in several years, that being [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598)'s [Euclid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384644#fruits/5156336) (MM1), a classic of a past mapping era. It received a few balancing tweaks, but it was definitely a surprise for the players who got to play a genuine older map in a World Cup setting, something we haven't seen in quite some time.

Another highlight of the pool was [No Hints Here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384656#fruits/5156354) (TB) by [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284), this week's tiebreaker. It's not often a song this chaotic is mapped, let alone chosen to be used as a World Cup tiebreaker, so it was quite a sight to behold. The song constantly switches between wildly different song genres, making it very difficult to get comfortable on, especially with the map reflecting the changes in genre shifts, featuring a ton of contrast between sections.

Unfortunately, matches in the Round of 32 don't usually reach the tiebreaker, so we didn't get to— wait, what?

Usually, you would expect the Round of 32 to be quite one-sided, with the higher-seeded teams having a clear and mostly undisputed advantage over the lower-seeded teams. This is what happened [last edition](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-05-29-osu-catch-world-cup-2024-round-of-32-recap#round-of-32-results), with only a few contested matches on the same round.

This year, however, had quite the Round of 32 — a total of four matches went to the tiebreaker, a most unexpected outcome. All of them were between teams that had fairly similar seedings and only one of them ended up in an upset, that being Colombia (#18)'s win against Mexico (#15), but it still made for one of the most exciting first weeks in recent CWCs.

An unexpected matchup this past week was the United States (#1) vs. South Korea (#32). These two countries have been dominating the scene for several years and have faced off many times in Finals or even Grand Finals of previous CWCs.

Pretty much all the previous South Korean players retired from tournament play, which resulted in them not even having a team last year. This year however, a new generation of players managed to get a squad going and qualify. In a twist of fate, their return to the World Cup was met not with your usual first-round opponent, but with a rematch of past Finals — just a little earlier in the bracket than you would expect.

One of the most exciting storylines of the osu!catch World Cup since last year has been the rise of the Icelandic team, being by far the least populated country to participate.

Last year, they managed to qualify, and did the same this year, despite the competition being harsher than ever. What they didn't manage last year, however, was winning any points in the bracket. This year's Round of 32 match was looking rough for Iceland (#29), as they were facing Italy (#4). So it was to everyone's surprise that their first ever map win in the tournament would end up being in this match, as well as their second, with a final score of 5–2 for Italy. Team Iceland is a gift that keeps on giving, and they sure don't look like they're about to stop.

### ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany vs. ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore

The very first match of this osu!catch World Cup set the tone for what was to be an incredible Round of 32. On paper, Germany (#13) is a team that's used to going pretty deep in the bracket, and Singapore (#20) often ends up dropping out early on, so Germany would be the clear favourite. In practice though, this match was a roller coaster of emotions for both teams, and couldn't have been closer.

Starting off with a [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384668#fruits/5156387) pick, Germany looked confident. Both ::{ flag=DE }:: [Lume](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4691991) and ::{ flag=DE }:: [wonderleif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14744799) got FCs right away, which is even more impressive given the fact that this was wonderleif's first ever CWC appearance.

Singapore managed to answer back with a successful pick of their own, on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384639#fruits/5156330), a notoriously tricky map in this pool, on which they managed to win convincingly, despite another FC from Lume. Germany didn't let that point loosen their focus, picking [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384633#fruits/5156317), the only convert of the pool. They proceeded to win the point, showing that their picking strategy was well thought out.

At this point, Singapore couldn't afford to let Germany get the first break point of the match, but unfortunately for them, Lume got his fourth FC in a row on [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384631#fruits/5156315) followed by wonderleif, a repeat of the first pick of the match. No one was there to match these scores on the side of Singapore, and they were now down one point. The situation got even more dire after another successful pick by Germany on the control-heavy [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384641#fruits/5156332).

Now standing on a 3-point lead, Germany was ready to close the match, whether it was on another break point or on their next pick. Singapore managed to win their pick with a consistency gamble on [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118392467), after which they would also snatch a break point on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384624#fruits/5156307) where captain and veteran ::{ flag=SG }:: [He Ang CTB](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2451381) managed to get an FC streak going. Now the score was 4–3, and Singapore chose [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384644#fruits/5156336) as their last pick. This ended up working out as well with a most impressive double FC from ::{ flag=SG }:: [[Eun]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3788536) on No Mod and He Ang CTB on Hard Rock, the latter ending up with a fourth FC in a row.

Singapore had managed to climb their way back to a tiebreaker from a 4–1 deficit. Germany had to lock in and perform to avoid being sent to the losers' bracket, and after a long and intense map, they pulled through, ending Singapore's streak of points. This match unexpectedly turned out to be one of the most exciting of the week, and we couldn't have hoped for a better start to the tournament.

### ::{ flag=BE }:: Belgium vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

Another exciting match was Belgium (#14) vs. China (#19), which had a similar setup but with a different outcome. Both teams were evenly matched in seedings from the Qualifiers, and despite China placing slightly lower, they've been known to be a scary opponent in early rounds these past years. This was one of the most anticipated matches of the weekend, and it ended up delivering.

Right from the get-go, Belgium looked solid. On China's very first pick of the match on [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384646#fruits/5156338), they managed to score a break point by only 7,000 points. After a convincing win on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384624#fruits/5156307) from Belgium, featuring an impressive FC from ::{ flag=BE }:: [Jezse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11390632), the close points would come back. On China's [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384632#fruits/5156316) pick, they once again missed out on a point, this time by less than 2,000 points, with one SS on each side, ::{ flag=BE }:: [ElSkeffe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6283136) for Belgium and ::{ flag=CN }:: [dazzulay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1948043) for China, respectively. And again, on [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384641#fruits/5156332), the score difference would be of only 14,000 for Belgium.

Despite their best efforts, Team China found itself down 4–0, and Belgium only had to win one point to close out the match. However, the momentum would shift on their next pick, [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384639#fruits/5156330), with only 3 misses across their players. They weren't about to go down without a fight, and continued their comeback on Belgium's next pick, [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118392467), with FCs on each side for ::{ flag=CN }:: [Cyphos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9740698), ::{ flag=BE }:: [Jezse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11390632), and ::{ flag=BE }:: [[ Ajia ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17578266). It was once again a very close point, but this time it was in China's favour. Their consistency and relentlessness were being rewarded, and they carried on to their [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384633#fruits/5156317) pick, which they successfully won.

However, unlike the Singaporeans who managed to get to a tiebreaker from a big score deficit on their own match, it wouldn't be the case for China as Belgium managed to close out the match before that with a great showcase of consistency on [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384631#fruits/5156315), for a final score of 5–3. The whole match was very intense with many close points, and it's always very hype to see the losing team make a comeback, even if it doesn't always end up on an upset. Go watch the match if you haven't!
