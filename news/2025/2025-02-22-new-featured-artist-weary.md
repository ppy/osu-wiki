Once upon a time, **WEARY** produced his first piece of music. Half a decade later, he landed in our Featured Artist library!

Filipino producer **WEARY** is an electronic music savant, focusing on progressive house and melodic dubstep, yet capable of tackling just about any genre in the field.

**13** awesome tracks are here to prove it, all available from [**WEARY**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/460) as pre-timed beatmap templates. Given [osu!(lazer) now supports beatmap submission](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-02-20-osulazer-updates-february-20-2025), it might be time to give mapping a shot.

We can talk about music all day, but listening (or playing maps) is the best way to experience **WEARY**'s sound:

There's more where that came from. See [**WEARY**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/460) for even more tunes and pre-timed `.osz` files (a.k.a. what you'll need to start your map).

What's happening next weekend, you ask? Perhaps a new Featured Artist. Or perhaps not. You'll find out soon enough.

Stay tuned.
