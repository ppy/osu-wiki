It's about time.

If you haven't heard of **Ice** by now, you might have never played a rhythm game before (osu! included, somehow).

Games like *maimai*, *Chunithm*, and *DJMAX* have featured **Ice**'s tracks throughout the years, and **Ice** has also operated behind the curtains in rhythm games as the music director for Rayark Games (the studio who made *Cytus*, *VOEZ*, and *Deemo*) and NEX.

Meanwhile on osu!, **Ice** has had no shortage of involvement in [osu!'s music scene](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music). From tracks created for events in the [Global Taiko Showdown](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS) series to the osu! original *Nostalgia Sonatina Op.3* from [this year's osu!catch World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025), **Ice**'s sound has likely penetrated your eardrums more times than you can count. If not, you're a lucky individual — you get to hear **Ice**'s iconic classical-electronic-infused style for the first time.

Over **20** tunes are part of [**Ice**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/484), quite a few of which you're bound to recognise.

This is just a taste of what **Ice** has to offer:

### [Ice - Nostalgia Sonatina Op.3](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/484/Songs/Ice%20-%20Nostalgia%20Sonatina%20Op.3.osz)

Yeah. That's a lot of music. And even more is available on [**Ice**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/484) with pre-timed beatmap templates (a.k.a. the things you'll need to start your own maps).

That's all for this week, but the Featured Artist train is still far from the end of the line. Stay tuned for another artist reveal next weekend!
