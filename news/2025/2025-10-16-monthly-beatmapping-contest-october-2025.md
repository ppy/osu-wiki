Your friendly neighborhood mapping contest is back.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/monthly-beatmapping-contest.png)

That's not much of a surprise though. The [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is a mapping contest that runs every month, so it'd be more unexpected if it didn't return.

Anyway, this month's contest is for **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch** mappers:

- [osu!taiko contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/265)
- [osu!catch contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/266)

osu! and osu!mania will be here next month! If they're not, every mapper will receive 1 osu!coin as restitution.

This article covers results from the last contest, plus criteria for this contest. Skip around with these links:

A certain someone is curious what happens when you reach double the [contest point](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) threshold for achieving the *Elite Mapper* title. We might have the answer fairly soon...

### Limitation

The Monthly Beatmapping contest would be the lamest contest in this game if it were the same every month. That's why we have *limitations*, a.k.a. special rules added in each contest to keep things fresh!

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [GiGas](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7300747) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

We've done a contest where we asked you to make maps less than 4 stars. Today's contest however isn't for babies.

This month's limitation: **your beatmap must be at least 7 stars.**

Judges will be evaluating your expertise across all categories: musical representation, structure, and the hardest part of this contest, i.e. creating something that's properly playable.

#### osu!catch

Difficulty settings are the first thing you choose when making a map. Usually you're free to choose whichever settings you want, but this time around, you have to do some math.

This month's limitation: **the sum of *circle size* and *approach rate* settings must equal 10.**

Every variation of these will affect your map overall, so make your choice wisely. And just to be sure you aren't disqualified because decimals break your brain, you may want to use a calculator.

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must choose *one* of the month's beatmapping [limitations](#limitation):**
  - **osu!taiko:** your beatmap must be at least 7 stars.
  - **osu!catch:** the sum of *circle size* and *approach rate* settings must equal 10.
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Submissions must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
