The renaissance is upon us with Resurrection Cup returning for a 2025 iteration — with more bangers, more customs and a large focus on competitivity!

[Resurrection Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2076778), or ResCup for short, is an annual open-rank Team VS tournament that attempts to bring a breath of fresh air to the top-tier competitive tournament scene.

## Original music and original maps

Over the past couple years, we have had the joy of sharing 40 originals with you. You can expect that trend to continue this year as well since, after the Qualifiers have finished, we will be releasing multiple original songs in every single mappool. If you thought last year was good, you bet we are going to surpass expectations this year as well, so be sure to tune in.

22 of last year's songs will also later be released as part of an album. To get a feeling of what this tournament has to offer sound-wise, here's a sample:

## What's new?

While Resurrection Cup mostly remains the same as what you are used to, we are changing things up a tiny bit. This year, instead of 4v4, Resurrection Cup will feature a 3v3 format with teams of up to 5 players! Furthermore, all players in a team are required to be from the same geographic region. More on that on our [website](https://rescup.xyz/)!

As to be expected from us, we have a lot of surprises up our sleeves this time around as well. With a legion of new mappers and artists joining our ranks, we are sure to bring you countless memorable original songs and many, many custom beatmaps designed and fine-tuned by experienced mappers, mappoolers and playtesters.

You can head over to the [website](https://rescup.xyz/) to find out more details about the overall mappool structure as well as other relevant rules.
