The first iteration of FTMC is on its way with the chilly autumn air! Are you ready to start your holiday mapping?

With the temperatures dropping rather quickly, we would like to give you a warm welcome to the **Fall Time Mania Mapping Contest**'s debut!

This mapping contest originated from its close seasonal partner, [STMI](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2050785?n=1), which was an osu!mania 6K contest with the goal of getting more players interested in the key mode. After the contest's success, we now want to welcome all mappers by allowing submissions **from 4 to 10 keys!**

In FTMC 2025, you'll submit one difficulty of one song from osu!'s [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks). The judging criteria are listed below, including a gimmick you'll need to adhere to. Other than that, the editor is your canvas! You may map as your heart desires as long as you follow the rules!

## Schedule

Please note that any schedule changes will be made known in the contest's [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/p8bwdrjExr) as well as through the forum post. Please keep an eye out on these outlets to receive the most up-to-date news regarding the contest.

- **Submissions must adhere to the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) as well as the [osu!mania ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/osu!mania)**. The winner will have a guaranteed BN for their map.
- **Submissions must not be publicly revealed until results are out, which includes sharing the map and/or submitting it through the editor**.
- Cut versions are allowed only if the song comes from the Featured Artist listing, the cut makes sense, and it's appropriately indicated as such with `(Cut ver.)` in the map's title.

- The allowed key modes range from 4K up to 10K. For this contest, 1K–3K and 10K+ key modes are not allowed.

## Submitting your entry

Submit your entry through the **[contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/268)**. You are allowed to resubmit your entry anytime before the mapping phase has ended. Here's a quick overview on how that works:

- When you're done mapping, export it through the editor.
- Once exported, drag and drop the `.osz` file onto the submission box in the [contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/268)
