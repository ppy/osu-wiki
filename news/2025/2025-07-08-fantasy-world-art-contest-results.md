**986** voters recognised [**Triantafyllia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17084594)'s portrayal of pippi and Alisa as Madoka and Homura, displaying their contrasting personalities much like the lovely roses and noxious lycoris flowers enveloping them, yet intertwined through a bond unbroken by space and time(s).

This is an inspired entry on many levels, earning it the top spot of this contest. It'll be awaiting future beholders on the client menu and profile pages around the community.

### peppy's Picks

Everyone got 15 votes to propose the next line-up of osu! main menu artwork, but we hear you, 15 votes weren't enough. To squeeze some more unique fantasy goodness into the game's main menu, we invited osu!'s main dev [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) to pick out his favourites:

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/banners/Maqmoon.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/winners/Maqmoon.jpg)

Following your first successful quest, you want to treat yourself with the hefty stash of osu!coins you acquired during your adventure. As it turns out, [**Maqmoon**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33452645) knows a place and recommends you to take a gander at some awesome potions freshly brewed by Mocha herself!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/banners/TESTER%20KIPUATKA.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/winners/TESTER%20KIPUATKA.png)

pippi casts FIREBALL and Mocha casts WATER SHIELD of blinding colours in [**TESTER KIPUATKA**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32067567)'s entry which was too good not to include on osu!'s main menu.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/banners/year-bear.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/winners/year-bear.png)

[**year-bear**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12178754) showed us the terrifying hijinks that the osu! cast were up to, with mage pippi and sword fighter Mocha turning tail against Taikonator 3000, the final boss of the dungeon. Meanwhile, Chirou, Mani and Mari get to experience slightly less stressful moments.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/banners/Deemuru.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/winners/Deemuru.png)

[**Deemuru**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12850994) brought to life a world of adventure for sword master Mocha and mage pippi to explore, not to mention in fashionable style and with excellently crafted equipment to accompany their travails.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/banners/Selithrarion.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/winners/Selithrarion.jpg)

We don't know what kind of curious alternate dimension [**Selithrarion**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4613388) managed to cook up where osu! looks like this instead of the circle clicking game we all know and love, but the idea has received peppy's seal of approval so we wish pippi's alternate universe twin "pippy" good luck on their journey.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/banners/Pyo.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/249/winners/Pyo.png)

[**Pyo**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6641784)'s lakeside spot of cute frogs, fairies and sunshine ended up being the perfect resting spot for goat Mocha and witch graduate pippi's day off.
