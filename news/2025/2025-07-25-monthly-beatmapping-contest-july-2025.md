## Beatmapping

### Limitation

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest would be stale if not for *limitations*. These are extra rules/prompts that mappers need to consider when making their maps, ensuring each month's submissions have their own features!

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [GiGas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7300747) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

You might be accustomed to freely using slider velocity changes throughout your maps, but due to unforeseen circumstances in the slider velocity economy, rations are being put in place.

This month's osu!taiko limitation: **the average of all slider velocities should be ~1.00x.**

Calculating this manually would be really annoying, so you can use [this tool](https://mappersguild.com/contests/mbc) instead. Any map within an average slider velocity in the range of 0.95x and 1.05x is acceptable for this contest!

Given this limitation is about balancing low and high slider velocities, you can expect a good score in the "limitation" judging category if your map uses slider velocities in interesting ways, as opposed to a map with a constant 1.00x slider velocity.

#### osu!catch

Where should you place hyperdashes? "Wherever the song justifies a hyperdash" might be your answer, but this limitation takes that question a step further.

This month's osu!catch limitation: **all hyperdashes must be placed on the same `x` coordinate throughout the map.**

To be extra clear, this is about the object with the hyperdash, *not* the object being hyperdashed to. For those who don't speak osu!catchlish, this means all glowy red fruits should be on the same `x` coordinate.

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!taiko:** the average of all slider velocities should be ~1.00x.
  - **osu!catch:** all hyperdashes must be placed on the same `x` coordinate throughout the map.
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Submissions must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
