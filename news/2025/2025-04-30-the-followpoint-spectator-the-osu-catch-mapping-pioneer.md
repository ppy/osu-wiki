Have you ever looked at osu! interviews and thought to yourself: "Hey, aren't there too few mapper interviews?" Well, today is your lucky day, as we are interviewing Spectator, one of the most iconic osu!catch mappers out there!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-04-30-the-followpoint-spectator-the-osu-catch-mapping-pioneer/banner.jpg)

You know how there are players, mappers and [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators), right? And it's not exactly common for one to do two, or even all three of these activities, but [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) is exactly this kind of person! While being a top player [peaking at rank #2](https://web.archive.org/web/20120701011805/http://osu.ppy.sh:80/p/pp/?m=2) and winning multiple [osu!catch World Cups](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC), he's also a mapper with many works of his in both [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) and [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved) categories. He's also a Beatmap Nominator, and not just a regular one, but an [Elite Nominator](/wiki/People/Elite_Nominators) with 145 beatmaps pushed to Ranked in 2024! And in addition to all this, Spectator is also a part of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) — truly a jack of all trades!

Now that you have an idea how big of a community figure Spectator is for osu!catch, let's get to hear what insights he has to bring! This time, [-Isla-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759) is joining in with questions as well.

Hi Spectator! Let's begin with the usual, how would you introduce yourself to the people who don't know you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

Hello everyone, I'm Spectator. I've been playing osu!, mainly in the osu!catch mode for almost 15 years. I used to focus on playing, but these days I'm probably more known as a mapper. I also nominate maps as a Beatmap Nominator and help moderate the osu!catch community as a Global Moderator.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

How did you find osu!, and what was your impression of it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

Back when I was 14, I was active in the Super Mario World ROM hacking community, and some people there recommended osu! to me. I found it really interesting—not just because I could play a wide variety of songs, but also because I could create my own maps.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

Why did you choose to be an osu!catch player among all game modes there are?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

I played standard too, but I was just better at osu!catch, which made it more fun and motivating to grind.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Is there a specific memory from osu! that stands out to you? If so, which one?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

There are a lot of great memories, but the most memorable one for me was the Grand Finals match of the [osu! Catch The Beat World Cup 2014](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2014). Our opponent was Germany, a team full of outstanding players like [NoteKuroi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/186642), [Nyan-Zapo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/480676), and [DeathXHunter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/405326).

Due to a DDoS attack, we had to replay the match without a stream, and it was one of the most nerve-wracking moments of my osu! tournament career. But somehow, I performed better in the rematch and managed to win the World Cup for the first time. Even to this day, those three players from Germany remain some of my best rivals in the game, and I'll always be grateful to them for the unforgettable memories.

Okay, now let's move on to mapping. What caused you to start mapping in osu!catch? Was there any particular reason or a person that motivated you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

When I first started mapping, osu!catch specific maps used to be unrankable. I mostly tried mapping just for fun, and received some positive feedback from other players. There was an old forum for every osu!catch player and I used to share my very first maps [there](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/21061?n=3561).

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-04-30-the-followpoint-spectator-the-osu-catch-mapping-pioneer/forum_post.jpg)

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

As someone who's been mapping for a very long time, do you have any tips or advice on how somebody would comfortably and efficiently get into mapping without any previous experience or knowledge?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

If you're new to osu!catch mapping, I'd recommend using the osu!lazer editor — it's a lot more intuitive than stable. As for mapping itself, I'll just quote my favorite line from [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134): "Just let your creativity flow." You don't have to be good at mapping to enjoy it, you might enjoy it first and improve along the way.

For more mapping tips from expert mappers, I recommend joining the [osu!catch Modding and Mapping Hub](https://discord.com/invite/ZuxFc4q) Discord server. There are plenty of people there who are willing to help and give feedback on your maps, so never hesitate to ask questions!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

What do you think of the current state of osu!catch mapping compared to let's say 10 years ago? Did it change a lot, and if so, was the change positive or negative in your opinion, and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

It's definitely changed a lot, in a good way. I still enjoy old maps, but over the years, the ranked section has brought so much variety, and now there are so many different styles and aspects in maps.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

Is there anything specific that you'd want to change in modern mapping if you could?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

Not a whole lot, but I do hope more mappers start breaking the mold and trying new things. As a nominator, it's pretty easy to find clean maps these days. However, it's still hard to find the maps that are unorthodox or push boundaries, such as low AR, small CS, hyperdashless, and other creative gimmicks. I'd be more than happy to nominate more of those.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

If osu!catch had a dedicated editor from the start rather than the standard editor, what would be different in your opinion, if anything?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

If we had a dedicated editor, our community might have grown much bigger, just because many mappers didn't give up and kept mapping for our mode.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

Are there any specific mapping styles that you like more than the others, and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

For my own maps, I usually stick to a simple style because I believe that every aspect of music can be expressed without being overly complex. I also value aesthetics a lot, so I'd say what I care about most when mapping are playability and visual design.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Isla-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17745759">-Isla-</a></p>

And as a bonus to the previous question, are there any mappers that you like or that inspired you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

Back when I started osu!catch mapping, there weren't many osu!catch specific maps, so I found most of my inspiration from standard mappers. I was really impressed by [RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883)'s mapping style, and later on, mappers like [Cherry Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1156742), [Frostmourne](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/199669), [Shiirn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/465126), and [Charles445](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/85000) also had a huge influence on me. In the modern era, [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) and Jemzuu have influenced me the most. They're capable of so much in the editor, and I'm always picking up ideas from their work.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

Before moving to the other topic we'd also like to congratulate you on recently achieving Elite Nominator title! Would you mind telling us what was your motivation to contribute so much to the beatmapping scene as a nominator during 2024?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

What brought me back to being a Beatmap Nominator was wanting to see more variety in the ranked section. Back in 2023, there also weren't many harder maps, especially those over 8 stars, so I wanted to help bring more of them into the ranked section.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

For this section, let's talk more about playing part of the game. Both as a top player and as a mapper, what are your thoughts on implementing osu!'s performance point [combo scaling removal](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-10-28-performance-points-star-rating-updates#combo-scaling-removal) ("CSR") to osu!catch? Would that be a bad or a good thing, and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

Personally, I'd love to see CSR implemented in osu!catch as well. Grinding the same maps over and over for an FC was one of the most stressful and draining parts of the game for me, and it eventually made me stop playing. If CSR were introduced to osu!catch, I believe it could motivate not just new players, but top players too.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Are you still playing competitively outside of osu!catch World Cups, or have you fully moved to mapping?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

I've mostly shifted to mapping, not just because I don't have enough time to grind, but also because I feel like I no longer stand out as a player.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

You have one specific score, [disinteGration by RINYA.G \[Collapse of the World Machine\] +HDHR](https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1956830227), pinned in your profile. Is there any story behind this or some other reason it's pinned?

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-04-30-the-followpoint-spectator-the-osu-catch-mapping-pioneer/score.jpg)

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

I was in a Discord voice chat, randomly trying maps with mods, and somehow FC'd it first try. I thought it's pretty unique to not have my top pp score as [iLLness LiLin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/777109#fruits), so I decided to pin it.

Before we get to the end of this interview, let me ask you a few more questions. Are there some goals in osu! that you are still planning to achieve? Either in general or mapping specifically.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

I want to reach 100 ranked maps, but aside from that, I don't have many goals. I'd like to make more memorable maps of my favorite songs, but more than anything, I just want to enjoy the game itself.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

If you could meet any osu! player IRL, who would you want to meet the most, and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

I met up with [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [wonjae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5032045) for the first time in Korea a few days ago, and it was an amazing experience. If I get the chance to meet more osu! players, I'd love to meet [Daletto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7592136), [Kukkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7811952), [-Luminate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4778689), and Jemzuu. They're not only the mappers I look up to, but also my closest friends in the game.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

And as the final question, do you have anything else that you'd like to mention?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Spectator.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598">Spectator</a></p>

In my 14 years of playing osu!catch, I've seen countless people come and go. To each and every one of them, thank you for the memories. Even after I quit the game, I'll never forget the experiences I had here.

Also, a huge thanks to everyone in the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) and Beatmap Nominators of osu!catch for spending their time to make osu!catch a better place. And lastly, thank you MegaMix for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed!

And that concludes the interview. Thank you to Spectator for joining us and sharing their experiences, and of course, thank you for being a *spectator*! We hope this has been a fun read!

See you next time! <3
