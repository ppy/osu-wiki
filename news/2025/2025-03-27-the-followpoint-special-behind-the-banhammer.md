Ever wanted to get some insight into how Global Moderation Team works? Then now is your chance as we've interviewed the GMT leaders themselves, so come and have a look at our (sometimes silly) questions!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-27-the-followpoint-special-behind-the-banhammer/banner.jpg)

Welcome, strangers and returning readers! Like you've already read in the title and the short intro, this post of The Followpoint will be an unusual one, talking about a team inside osu! instead of an individual person. The [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) (usually referred to as GMT) is one of the essential and oldest osu! teams, consisting of community members who mainly focus on player moderation. Its [wiki article](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) explains things really well, so you should give it a read if you haven't yet!

We're still an interview series, and for today's news post we interviewed **all 3 current leaders** of the Global Moderation Team: [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724), [Kobold84](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533) and [Venix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631)! Be warned though, please don't expect this to be all serious and reveal every secret or something. We tried to make the questions interesting while also remaining a little bit silly. ðŸ™ƒ

And now with the small introductions done, let's get to the interview!

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Hello, for starters let's do a question about history! In the past GMT were called Administrators, but why specifically?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kobold84.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533">Kobold84</a></p>

At one point Admins had [the same usergroup](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) we have now, but that was from before I even heard of the game. Some curious users could refer to [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074341/https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/GMT) but this group didn't really have anything to do with the GMT. As for the term itself, "Administrators" must have been used only because of the phpBB default user title for users with the admin control panel.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Why are GMT members' names red in osu!(stable) chat despite the usergroup having green colour?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kobold84.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533">Kobold84</a></p>

IRC shenanigans. Due to the chat system the stable client is integrated with, all users with an operator status (mod powers) are red, so it's not just us who are red! Admins and devs also have this color and of course the full-red NAT.

As with many things, this is fixed in lazer.

> peppy clarification: It actually has nothing to do with IRC, and more to do with there originally only being one moderator team. peppy wishes it was still this way rather than there being 10 different teams.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What are the key differences between a regular GMT member and a leader of the team, do you have any additional tasks for example?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

When it comes to day-to-day things, leaders aren't dissimilar from other members of the team, however we have additional tasks and duties to perform.

We not only perform moderation tasks ourselves, but also work to facilitate and moderate internal discussions on various matters, whether it'd be ideas on improving the team, a current process, or a contentious matter within the community.

We make ourselves available to every member for any issue that they might have, and are ready to talk to them and make sure their voices are heard.

There's a little bit of "admin work" involved as well, mostly relating to the intake and departure of team members, making sure that people aren't completely inactive, but that's small compared to everything else.

At the end of day, regardless if a member is a leader or not, we are all just trying to make sure the game is safe for everyone, actively host and participate in community projects and events, and deeply care for this game and its community. The leaders are just there to make sure everything is running smoothly in every way possible.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Do GMTs deal with inappropriate usernames and how does that usually happen if so?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

The GMT does not directly deal with inappropriate usernames, however we do see the community reporting the names, and we forward them to the appropriate team, so keep sending those reports in.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Some may know that if your username is deemed inappropriate then it will be changed to "Slowpoke" followed by the first available number, but what is the origin of this idea? Is there any special story behind it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Venix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631">Venix</a></p>

We've had this rolling joke around for a while now, where moderators would react with :slow: emoji (containing Slowpoke PokÃ©mon image) when somebody acted on a report, or a case that was already handled by someone else.

This later escalated into a more general and wide Slowpoke spread in the moderator communities, notably with [Civil oath](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3216107) building identity around it; Slowpoke naming strategies arose from that momentum just as well and somehow sticked around to this day.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Speaking of which, how many "Slowpokes" are there currently?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Venix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631">Venix</a></p>

1386 and counting.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

While many players are aware of the bi-weekly osu!dev catch-up meetings on the official server, little is known about the internal discussions or processes within the GMT itself. So, can you tell us how your team meetings typically work?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

As of this year we have quarterly GMT meetings, and there's a couple of things we have to solidify before even scheduling a meeting.

A month or so before the meeting, the leaders along with team members create an agenda where the team collectively decides which topics we need to discuss. The agenda remains open and editable up until the meeting itself.

A few weeks before the meeting we establish a date and time that fits the most people, since there's around 70 members in different timezones, and when the time comes, we go through all of the topics, take meeting notes, and either conclude discussions, or figure out next steps.

The GMT leaders will then work on the next steps, and make sure everything's followed up on.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Have you as the GMT ever had situations where you weren't sure if the player should be punished for something or not, and how did you handle such cases?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kobold84.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533">Kobold84</a></p>

A good rule of thumb is to always ask for more opinions if you're not sure of something. The process is streamlined, we regularly ping and confirm with each other before committing. So to answer your questions, yes, this happens all the time.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Was there ever a case where the players' reaction to some rule made the GMT change it or a punishment for breaking it? And if so, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing, and why?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kobold84.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533">Kobold84</a></p>

It happens sometimes, a reaction to something sparks a discussion and we then clarify whether it was really the right move or not. In some cases it's a good thing, because if you keep doing the same thing the same way, it's bound to become outdated. And since moderators have a skewed perception on many things due to their experience (we tend to see things from a moderator's perspective and not from an average player's), a reality check from the community every once in a while helps the team make the best decision.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Are GMTs taking part in updating rules on [this wiki page](/wiki/Rules), for example, can a normal GMT member start a discussion about changing some rule to make it more clear?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kobold84.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533">Kobold84</a></p>

Yes. The current rules page was reworked in 2017 and the GMT had a more direct control over what was on it. We gathered suggestions for specific rule changes and had a vote afterwards. Most of the time the implemented changes haven't been major rule changes â€” the vibes are out of our control. After all, we don't set the vision of how the community should be moderated, we only upheld it.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Since the GMT [user group page](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) refers to the NAT as their sibling team, who do you think would come out on top if these two were put into a boxing ring?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

We'd whoop their butts any day of the week. If we were to just put the leaders one up against another, put me against [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976) and I'd KO him without breaking a sweat.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Why do some channels listed on [wiki page about GMT](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team#grouped-by-languages-moderated) not have any moderators assigned? Is it because said channels aren't very active, or does the team just not have anyone speaking this language?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724">0x84f</a></p>

It can be either of those two, or both. I'd say the more common scenario we have is that we have members that speak the language, but the chat just isn't active. There are some exceedingly rare cases where some channels need moderation without active moderators, but we are actively working on closing those gaps.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Speaking of which, I've heard of GMT applications opening for people who speak a specific language in the past, to get more people for channels that lack moderation, but how and who usually decides that a specific language needs more moderators?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Venix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631">Venix</a></p>

Usually, it's just somebody from the team pointing out the critical lack of moderators in a certain area â€” you know â€” it's not that hard to notice when things are getting out of hand somewhere.

For regular day-to-day additions it usually works the opposite way: if we have a person be active in a channel or a certain area, their candidature will be likely discussed when they are here rather than specifying a need for moderation of a certain field and then considering the addition.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Do you have any plans to have a permanent application system in the future, like what BNs have on their website?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kobold84.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3227533">Kobold84</a></p>

The short answer is we don't have "plans" to have them permanent.

The longer answer is that we've had this suggestion from time to time, and it seems enticing, since the workload is huge if we go through all applicants at once. However, this suggestion hasn't had a lot of support, and one of the main reasons I can think of is that it's important for our team to have a huge influx of "fresh blood" to lessen the disconnect between the community and the GMT. This way there's a natural rotation and no stagnant air.

From my experience with all of the apps it does seem true that with each new round, you could see positive changes within the team after bringing in dozens of new members all at once. Hopefully, the [current apps](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-03-09-gmt-apps-now-open) will work out the same way.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Are there any specific misconceptions about the GMT's responsibilities or authority that you think players often misunderstand and you'd like to clarify?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Venix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631">Venix</a></p>

Once in a while, you can come across the statements that the Global Moderation Team is responsible for handling account restrictions, silence appeals, or account-related inquiries in general. As a matter of fact though, this belongs to the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team)'s set of tasks.

If you are facing any issues with your account, please consult the article above and direct your concerns to one of the outlined inboxes.

And lastly, what is your favorite GMT out of context quote?

I'd like to thank all Global Moderation Team members for everything they do for osu! and their efforts to make chats a nicer place! I know that sometimes it doesn't seem like it, but they are really trying their best. I know some of them myself and they are amazing people. <3

And of course thank you 0x84f, Kobold84 and Venix for agreeing to this interview and answering my questions, I'm really glad I was given this opportunity to show a wider audience a bit more of what the GMT really is!

Now I'll say a few words about The Followpoint itself. After our [last interview](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-12-05-the-followpoint-hivie-the-man-of-many-things) things slowed down due to a lot of things happening in our lives, but now as we recover, things should get back to normal. Anyway, I really hope you enjoyed this special interview, and thank you for reading it!

Right now we cannot promise the next interview will come out on schedule like before, but please look forward to a new interview coming out hopefully soon enough, and make sure to keep an eye on the news feed! You may also follow us [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thefollowpoint.megamix.dev) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/The_Followpoint) to see more updates and question submissions for future interviews.

And as always, see you next time! <3

â€”MegaMix
