## Activities

### Cosplay show

A cosplay show was organised during the event, allowing anyone to show themselves as their favourite (or funny) character. All participants' cosplays were also judged by event organisers, choosing these works as the best ones:

**1st place** - ::{ flag=RU }:: **myfk** cosplaying Rin Kaenbyou from the *Touhou Project*. Her ribbon show during the event shocked everyone, immediately proving that she deserves that first place.

**2nd place** - ::{ flag=RU }:: **[ksuenoot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5069845)**, a winner of last year's cosplay show, with a cosplay of Burnice from *Zenless Zone Zero*. She became the only person to reach the top 3 in the cosplay shows for 2 consecutive years.

### Gaming booth

A dedicated gaming booth was set up for all osu! players where they could play *Beat Saber*, *Taiko no Tatsujin*, and, well... osu!

### Match highlights

#### ::{ flag=RU }:: [BJIADOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17031854) vs. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785)

**[View the match VOD here! (Russian commentary)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dR9aCY2Bq4w&t=2870)**

The first match of the tournament, unlike most of the viewers' expectations, became the first (and only) match that went up to tiebreaker!

::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785) was very good with his speed picks, as well as the flow stream one. ::{ flag=RU }:: [BJIADOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17031854), on the other hand, showed himself well on the snap alt and Hidden mod picks, with HD3 being the only close map (14,627-point difference!) up until the tiebreaker. The tiebreaker itself was even closer, but with a total difference of 13,725 points, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785) managed to win and advance to the next stage!

#### ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) vs ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867)

The final match of the tournament. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867), the runner-up for the last 2 iterations of MOE, now got a third chance to win the tournament. On the other end, even though ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) hadn't got this far before and actually lost to ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) last year, he also was a high contender to win it all this time.

The first half of the match went pretty straightforward: both players were easily taking their picks up until the score of 3–3. After that, something went wrong and 3 break points have happened in a row, getting the score to 4–5 in favour of ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867), leaving him with a pick at match point.

In the end, with a score of 6–4, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) got the last point and won Moscow osu! Event for the first time, breaking his second-place curse. His performance during the whole tournament was astonishing, making him one of the best Russian players without a doubt!
