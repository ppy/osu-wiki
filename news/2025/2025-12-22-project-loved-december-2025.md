Grab a warm blanket, a cup of hot chocolate, and join us in celebrating awesome maps for the last time this year!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

In case you're new here (or somehow have been living under a rock), here's what we do: Project Loved hosts community voting polls every month to decide on beatmaps to be added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps chosen are lovingly selected by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes from community suggestions. Each beatmap banner in this news post will direct you to the respective poll and the handcrafted description from a captain. Alternatively, you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for **10 days**, so don't forget to vote before it's too late! More information can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

As always, thanks for voting on last round's picks! Results can be found here:

- [Results for osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2153205?n=2)
- [Results for osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2153204?n=2)

Before we present this month's picks, we got some exciting changes within the Loved team that we want to report.

As you may remember, we opened applications for osu! captains [last round](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-11-16-project-loved-november-2025), so now let's give a round of applause to the new roster of osu! captains: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961), [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929), [seros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10562853), [Riot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4256461), [Petal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7354729), [Bernkastel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5154946), and [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552)! 🎉

Also, [Yasuho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8458835) has moved out of the metadata den into the video studio — this means we're back on track with preview videos!

Lastly, let's give a warm farewell to [Lilian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8589120) and [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9856910), as they're moving on from their captain duties.

And without further ado, here are this month's nominations!

The first *Popular Playcount* of this month is [Settia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2445897)'s map of [Shoji Meguro & Lyn - Last Surprise -Scramble-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1118549#osu/2342277).

More [Settia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2445897) up for Project Loved voting is always a good sight, isn't it?

This song was very popular in 2020, amassing over 200,000+ plays and 200+ favorites. This is one of Settia's most played maps, which really puts it into perspective. As expected from Settia, this map is a true aim test. At a base of 246 BPM and 7.6★, this map is a multi-BPM set. There exist difficulties at 271 BPM, 295 BPM and 320 BPM to test your aim to its limits.

Do you want to see this finally get a leaderboard? Go ahead and cast your vote!

Our second *Popular Playcount* selection this time is [Assailant in the Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/231911#osu/538698), mapped by [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905).

A map well known for its daunting 609-combo deathstream at a whopping 294 BPM, it offers absolutely no room for rest and stands out as a true benchmark for testing your speed capabilities. Now aiming for Loved, if you have ever wanted to compare your tapping skills with the very best players in the game, be sure to vote for this map to be Loved!

*Play at your own risk. The Loved team is not responsible for any broken wrists, strained fingers, or other hand-related injuries you may sustain while attempting this map.*

*description written by [momoyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12469536)*

Coming in with this month's *Outstanding Oldies* we have...

LunaSaika's beatmap of Lindsey Stirling - Master of Tides is a set with lots of aim patterning AND a lot of grid-snapped and geometrical patterns, which makes it ultra fun and a good aim practice map for a certain demographic. Some sections do have Hi-Speed sliders, or well, something that used to be considered that 9 years ago, beware.

I tried to push this beatmap to Ranked for 2 years. Unfortunately, the mapper has left us, so it won't be possible at this point.

VOTE YES!!

*description written by [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656)*

This month's *Small Spectacles* pick is much more than a "low play count pick".

Coming to the Loved section is [-Links'](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10804237) take on [Seru Giran's La Grasa de las Capitales](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2141945#osu). True to the spirit of the category, -Links brings a slightly uncommon genre to the spotlight with Argentinian rock — something [that also happened to make an appearance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2465419#osu/5396884) in [this year's OWC](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025)! Settle in for a chill, enjoyable alt experience with a touch of aim and rhythm control as you work your way through one of the coolest and most delicate songs osu! has to offer.

Vote yes!!

Closing out the year for our *Daredevil Difficulties* slot, we have a monster of a map: [Hollow Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/416662)' RIDICULOUSLY hard rendition of [Five Hammer - fffff](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1084900#osu).

You all may be familiar with [Luscent](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688581)'s [8★ difficulty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1290926) of the short version of this track, which also has become a staple among high skill cap aim control players. Now more than FIVE years later, I'd love to invite you to play HW's demonic rendition of the full version of this track. You'll be in for 4 minutes of near 9★ grid-snapped aim and finger control Hell, all on circle size 7. This one's what we like to call FBC (Full Body Chills).

This map is so awesome I'm going to tell you to vote YES Five times.\

This will be the last time we see our *Ranked Rejects* slot this year, so here's to an Uma 2025 with [Various Artists - Ms. VICTORIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1935569#osu).

WE ARE BRINGING BACK PEAK SONGS TO STREAM MAPS. Like usual, the mapset that [lushifer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13356408) put together for us features many difficulties for all ranges of players to compete on, ranging from 5★ to 7.8★. The top difficulty, mapped by [Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119507) (a fantastic addition to this beatmap spread), was featured as the stream map pick in the [osu! World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025) Semifinals. You'll need to max out your Speed, Stamina, Power, Guts, and Wit to pass this one.

Make sure to vote "YES", or you'll finish in last place...

This month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* is getting a little... Lively...

Anyway, [moph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2233878)'s take on [Will Stetson's Live In Life](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1977290#osu/4104690) finally gets a shot at Loved, welcoming both a new mapper and a returning artist to the section. This deceptively difficult swing map will test your rhythmic understanding and aim control as you work to parse its patterns, all while dancing along to its magnificent song. Buckle up, as this map never lets up and is a ton of fun for those with the rhythm-game genes.

Will already pretty much said it for me, so I'll reiterate: "After all, you've got to live in life — and vote yes!"

Guys, you aren't going to believe it... One of the greatest achievements in osu! history has been claimed... An astounding 4 pp play of all time, on the one and only...

Anyways, for the waning year of 2025, we have our pick for the *Meme Monstrosities* category, [foooouurr pp](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1137280#osu/2375531). [Woey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3792472)'s map of an iconic remixed clip of [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) achieving his iconic first Hidden Hard Rock Full Combo on [United](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/237768#osu/550235) is quite the experience, to say the least.

The half-minute map is a showcase of [OliBomby's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6573093) [sliderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/f6sijp/sliderator_sliderates_your_sliders_into/), released earlier that year in 2020, with lots of variable slider velocity changes mapped to the distorted and pitch-shifted vocal clips. Watch your step with these fairly deceptive sliders, as you will need multiple tries, and perhaps even analysis in the in-game editor to make heads or tails of them!

Be sure to drop a yes vote for more brilliant 4 pp plays!

Wowwww. Seems like [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656) bummed out this month and forgot to nominate [Mahloola Regional Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1853003?n=1) customs. I guess I gotta get on the case... 🔍

To start off our final round of *Wildcard* picks for the year, we have [nooj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271086) and [Feiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3214844)'s technical map opus on [Project-G - Chronokinesia (Xykrome) (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2135377#osu). This might be one of the most relenting tech maps you will ever play. Starting after just the one-minute mark, you do not get a single break until the map reaches its end two and a half minutes later. In combination with the stunning visuals the two mappers present, this beatmap is a must-play to any high-level tech players looking to grind out a consistency score.

Do you think you have what it takes? Vote YES on this map's voting poll to find out...

Good heavens, would you look at the time! It's time to get your dancing shoes ready because oh boy, you are gonna need them for this one.

For one of the Wildcard picks this month, we've got a map from one of the biggest representants of Asian mapping culture, [Snow Note](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/643394)'s [Vandalusia Kai - hora de verdad](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/184534#osu/441740). At a not-to-be-underestimated BPM of 280, the map challenges your abilities to aim quickly, tap quickly and transition from alt and jump patterns to shorter bursts, paired with a very Spanish Flamenco-influenced track.

Are you up for the challenge? Or is the "hour of truth" too much for you to handle?

WC3? I thought this was NM4.... these new mappoolers just ruin everything...

This month's final *Wildcard* pick is [Altai's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5745865) [Juggernaut - Rebellion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1880627#osu/3871738). Straight from [OWC '22](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2022), Altai puts your tech fundamentals to the test with a mix of slider tracing, cutstreams, and aim control. And if you feel Altai's difficulty is a bit out of reach, you can always give the Wispy difficulty a try instead.

Good luck, and vote yes!

For the most jolly time of the year, the Loved team is bringing you a very jolly collab! [YOASOBI - Idol (Imaginary Reality Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1978895#taiko) is a collab with 15 different difficulties by 15 different mappers across 4 countries and 2 continents! I'm sure a lot of you are already familiar with the original song "Idol" by YOASOBI from the hit anime "Oshi no Ko", however, Imaginary Reality, also known as [Takehirotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794), came through and spiced it up with this speedcore remix. The thumping beat combined with the smooth guitar riffs and beeping SFX, this song has transformed into a different animal but the same beast (or should I say beat?).

Ranging from mid 6 stars to a daredevil level of 9.9 stars, if you're ready for a speedy challenge, look no further! This is definitely the map for you to try out! Be sure to call your friends and family, aunts and uncles, dogs and cats to vote for this map!!

This dopamine rush of a marathon map was custom mapped for [Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2021) and is one of the most memorable picks of the Grand Finals pool.

This map is truly special, but I don't want to spoil everything. You should play it to experience it by yourself and vote YES if you want this map to become Loved!

An unspoken Project Loved rule states that each month, at least one 9★ Japanese-style dump map has to be selected. December, of course, is no exception!

This [xi - PEACE BREAKER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1712580#taiko) set includes two very challenging, but also very distinct difficulties by [aHTaonN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4655546) and [syaron105](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8741695), with both focusing on constant snapping changes and crazy bursts. While aHTaoN's difficulty's main challenge comes from mechanically demanding bursts and complicated colour changes, syaron105's difficulty goes beyond. It adds crazy snapping changes that will humble even the best tech players around.

Vote "YES" if you want this monolith of a challenge to become Loved!

[IMANU - Monchou (TRINIST Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1692990#taiko/3459500) by [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501) is a low-BPM tech map for all current or aspiring tech virtuosos! Originally, this was mapped for [Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2021 Finals](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/SGTS_2021) as an NM3. Monchou gets its difficulty from the multitude of snappings and rhythmic changes, rather than being exceptionally high BPM like you may expect of a Finals tech map, including 1/4, 1/6 and 1/8 patterns as well as occasional usage of 1/5, 1/12 and 1/16 snappings! Monchou constantly throws uniquely complex patterns and rhythms at the player, requiring absolute precision and focus to be played accurately!

Give *Monchou* a try and see how your accuracy holds up!

With each mapper bringing unique ideas and various challenges to the map, this map will test you with 300 BPM speed sections, constant streams, tech sections and SV, with most of this occurring throughout the map at different BPMs due to the song's regular BPM changes between 150–300 BPM!

Pomegranate is great fun and a challenge truly deserving of a late-stage tiebreaker. Try it out to test how well rounded your skills are, and remember to vote "Yes"!

Hello. It's time for everyone's favorite Speed Map! This time, we're introducing [TrySail - Adrenaline!!! (J-Core Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/674549#taiko/1427256) made by [_mp1506](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/674549#taiko/1427256)!!

If you're a fan of Speed Maps, you've probably heard of this one! This is a 350 BPM double-BPM map where a storm of 1/4 patterns will hit you hard! The notes density is high, but the patterns are relatively easy to hit, making it a good practice map for speed maps!

Also, this DT map is a simple one, that even players lacking confidence in their skills can thoroughly enjoy, so I highly recommend giving it a play.

Continuing the [TWC](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC) trend from Horiiizon's pick this month, we've decided to choose a map with a ginormous amount of aura — [Gunoi Chop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354610#taiko).

[Gunoi Chop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354610#taiko) is an osu! original hallmarked by [Rahatt's](https://soundcloud.com/rahatt_bc) signature Balkan breakcore sampling, and what better way to map it than to utilise a Balkan mapper as well — [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091)! The word on the street is NM1, lots of doublets, plenty of 1/6, and a short stream part to test your endurance. Some say that there's even a cheeky speed-up waiting for you two-thirds into the map!

So, are you ready to take on Skopje's Final Boss? You didn't get it from me, but I heard that voting "Yes" will vastly improve your scores!

[The Map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1850669#taiko) is ***THE*** map that should be familiar to everyone who has a taste for difficult tech maps.

Originally mapped for the [Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022), the map has some of the most ridiculous, unique tech patterns and colouring. *The Map* is a very eerie and atmospheric song, and [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) absolutely nails the song rendition to a tee. Prepare to have your eyes glued to your monitor: one mistake in the map and it's all over.

Although OD 8 might not seem like much to seasoned taiko players, taking the map's difficulty into consideration, I believe you should be proud just by reaching 97% accuracy.

Some of you might be wondering what the map in question is, but all you'll have to do is download *The Map* and see for yourself. ;)

We get it. Not everyone is good at tricolour and barline gimmicks, and not everyone enjoys them, so let's take a look at a **REAL** gimmick map.

[Falling](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1963585#taiko) is a classic raw reading challenge mapped by none other than [clockbite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16736934). We are all used to the same old tale of yellow notes and barlines, but what about low SV with dense patterning, SV streams and overlapping notes? Falling has it all. Don't let the low star rating fool you, because if you blink, you might miss what happened on your screen!

If you're feeling extra confident, make sure to try the map with mods to prove that you're a true gimmick champion!

Last but not least, have you ever wondered what would happen if you combined mania and taiko? And no, it's not TaikoMania. 🤫

[Bestest Frenemy!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2410747#taiko) is an unconventional SV map that gained notoriety in the [jorttt tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2082409?n=1) by using a relatively unexplored concept: storyboard SV. The base structure of the map comes at around 4★, but that's not where the true difficulty comes from.

Choppy SV is the name of the game, and staying on rhythm is more than key! Throughout the entire map, your brain will be constantly asking: *"Is this pattern 1/2? This one looks like 1/6... But these notes were so far apart from each other!"* After a few attempts, though, I'm sure you will get it down. If maps like this interest you, I highly recommend checking out the other storyboard maps from the aforementioned jorttt tournament.

As always, feel free to give the map a shot and turn up at the polls to vote. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! See you in 2026! 🎄🎆

**Subject**: MISSION BRIEFING - PROJECT "[SUPERNOVAE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1823516#fruits)"

Attention. You have been selected for a three-stage expedition into a celestial event coordinated by Lead Singularity Engineer [Sutavv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5320583). This is not a standard expedition. What you will be undertaking is a long and dangerous descent into a cosmic singularity that challenges every known law of spatial navigation.

Due to the sheer magnitude of the entity, the mission has been divided into three phases.

**PHASE I: Entering the Nebula**\
Your primary objective will be to adapt to the local pressure. The Nebula is inherently hostile from the first coordinate, so you will be expected to find your rhythm and stay in control immediately, despite the high-intensity structural patterns surrounding you. Do not get overwhelmed before the mission truly begins.

**PHASE II: Hypergiant Collapse**\
As you approach the dying star, your consistency and focus will be tested. You will encounter gravitational anomalies and structural patterns never before recorded. Navigating these unclassified distortions will require techniques you have neither prepared for, nor have been trained for. You must not waver, as any misstep could cost you your life.

**PHASE III: Supernovae**\
The final destination. The Supernovae, a blinding release of pure energy, the death of a star. The speed, frequency, and structure of the incoming matter will be of levels never seen before, demanding a level of control, focus, and reaction that pushes human limits. The explosion will be short, but of a mind-blowing intensity. If you manage to come back unscathed, you will be the first human to come back from a Supernovae.

You are now aware of the contents of the mission. However, an expedition of this scale requires approval from the members of the project. Do you believe our explorers are ready for the mission? The choice is yours.

[Fauzan 2000](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9317817) is no stranger to the Loved section. Their eccentric and challenging, but uniquely fun style has made for some of the most memorable graveyarded maps in the osu!catch section, and [Aa Kenran no Yume ga Gotoku (Epsilon Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1116685#fruits/2332790) is definitely one of them.

Filled with tons of cool ideas and patterns that you don't really find in the Ranked section, this map was at one point a multiplayer classic and a great test of skills outside the boundaries of those typically found in Ranked maps. Nowadays, this map isn't considered as crazy as it was back when it was submitted due to how much mapping has evolved since then, but it clearly did introduce some new flow and pattern ideas that were ahead of its time. Even if it is aged, it's still a blast to play and feels very unique compared to the average 7-star map, so give it a shot!

Clean patterns, fantastic chill Touhou music, and a rich history of tournament usage with various mods make it one of our suggestions for the upcoming Loved project voting.

Although the map's CS 3 and AR 8 settings might not be a big challenge for top players, adding a few extra mods should make it enjoyable for everyone and bring back great memories for many of our players.

Classical music. Most would think of it as calm and relaxing, with maps of the genre likely to be slow and easy. Well, this is definitely not the case for [Flight of the Bumblebee](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1959678#fruits/4060734), mapped by [100](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10887159), turning classical music into an endgame speed and stamina map.

At a BPM of 208, much above the comfort range of almost every player out there for maps of this style, the minute and a half of continuous wiggles, antiflow streams, and tapdashes is not for the faint of heart. It might be short, but it pretty much never stops once it starts.

If you think it would be a great addition to the growing collection of speed maps in the Loved section, vote yes!

[Li Huayu - 996](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2148865#mania) by [Ainer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13371424)\
140 BPM, 2:22 | 2.71★, 2.71★\
*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

You wanna know the funny story about trying to get [Ainer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13371424) to the Loved section?

First things first: Ainer has been an iconic presence for years within the SV community, although often within the shadows because of account troubles. They semi-recently got their account back and have been significant contributors to the tournament scene, not only for SV, but also in other categories such as LN, and even rice! Overall, I've been respecting Ainer as a prolific and versatile mapper, and a quite underrated one at that.

It shouldn't come to you as a surprise that I have attempted to slot an Ainer entry before, but it was decided that it would be a better fit for the Ranked section after polishing, Ranked-friendly SV tweaks, and a full difficulty spread. That entry was none other than [Elevator](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1986520#mania/4126482), which now boasts critical acclaim and kickstarted a small trend of ranked SVs along with [WYNEHOUSE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1986990#mania/4127532).

Fast-forward 2 years to now, I've realized that despite being one of the most iconic SV mappers of all time, Ainer does not have any Loved entries. So let's get to promoting one of their most feared concoctions, one that is *most definitely, never even in a million years,* 100% unrankable.

[996](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2148865#mania), not to be confused with 67, 420, 69 or god-forbid, 727, is an elegant technical display of an SV mapping device that was popularized by... \*checks notes\*... [my own SV take of Digibuprofen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062256#mania/4311995)? I mean, the device has definitely existed for a while, but I do think its execution has improved a lot from its official MWC feature. Anyways, I don't think the gimmick in question has an official name, but it essentially consists of one quad, a complete 0-BPM freeze, and notes that you have to read ahead. What do we even call it? The "read-ahead gimmick"? "Freeze reading"? "Za warudo"?

In any case, it's a really interesting reading challenge, and one that requires a fair amount of training, especially the way Ainer chains them within the main drop. I think it will make for a pretty unique entry in the Loved section, and I'm also looking to push more of that as the years go by. Like, comment and subscribe if you agree. Uh, I mean vote in the thread, same thing.

*Come on Barbie, let's go party~*

[-Shiraishi-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19914734)'s [Barbie Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1948708#mania/4035657) certainly grabbed quite a lot of attention, and it being a chordjack chart certainly helps. Being one of the more popular patterns that players train, this chart has a lot to offer in improving your reading and stamina capabilities.

[Barbie Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1948708#mania/4035657) leans towards the density aspect, featuring a lot of hands and quads that can easily make you tired. Included are also a lot of anchors, testing your dexterity and stability as well. Not to mention, this chart only contains one "long" break overall, giving you only one chance to recover. Overall, there are many tests that this chart provides, and personally speaking, they have definitely given me a lot of trouble playing consistently, especially with the patterning.

Despite chordjacks being one of the easier patterns to accurately hit, you are definitely very prone to getting a lot of bad judgments, specifically 100s and 50s. If you are not paying attention to how this chart's flow is going, you may be in a lot of trouble. Through [Barbie Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1948708#mania/4035657), you will definitely be trained very well in the chordjack skill set, and if you think that 1.0x is too slow, well, rates up to 1.4x are present.

It's safe to say this song has quite the reputation behind it, and that continues to be proven even further with [hna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12335541)'s chart of [The Words I Never Said in D&B](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1619509#mania/3306566)!

When it comes to hna's charting history, this ends up being on the somewhat older end, as it was what started her jumpstream charting journey, being heavily inspired by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707)'s work. It's a very straightforward and laid-back jumpstream chart, with the density not being too high, and the BPM being on the lower end at 172. Even then, there's still rates up to 1.4x for those who wish to challenge themselves further, but hey, who knows? Even if you're not as experienced, the light density might make this more playable than you would assume.

Regardless on if you're trying to challenge yourself or not, it's heavily recommended you give this a play regardless, so give it your vote in the thread!

[Dillon Cooper - Knuckle Up](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1329797#mania) by [axtrmnt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5639397)\

*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Knuckle Up](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1329797#mania/2755265) is an extremely difficult technical chart. Not only does it contain a lot of confusing patterns to hit, they are also thrown at you relentlessly. You are thrown with essentially a mixed bag of many patterns, acting as a continuous barrage of tests for your technical ability. The chart is only a minute and 25 seconds long; however, the lack of breaks make up for it, which is why stamina is definitely a factor to this chart as well.

Overall, [Knuckle Up](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1329797#mania/2755265) is a great chart for testing how good you can play technical charts that require you to have exceptional reading skills, as a few rushes or late hits could easily ruin the run. After all, there are only 1,478 objects in this entire chart, meaning that there is a small margin of error only. This means that should you drop even a few greats or a few misses, that would be a huge decrease in the score or accuracy that you will be getting here.

Additionally, rates up to 0.7x are present, which could be a massive help in understanding how the chart works altogether. Numerous players may even try to push their limits even further, which is why rates up to 1.2x are also here in this chart.

This chart has been notorious in the 4K rhythm game scene, and this has definitely been proven and tested by many players all across the osu!mania 4K community. As always, don't be afraid to share your thoughts in the thread, and vote what you think is best!

[Laur - Exitium](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1213588#mania) by [Superoverclock](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620652)\
260 BPM, 2:17 | 1.09★ – 6.42★\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Exitium](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1213588#mania/2527197) is a set with numerous difficulties, each having their own challenges. From the [Easy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1213588#mania/2527197) up to the [DESTRUCTION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1213588#mania/2525713) difficulty, there are many ways for players to have fun in this chart, as there are difficulties that are present, catering to every skill level. It should be no surprise that this chart is extremely popular, and [Superoverclock](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620652) has done a great job in being able to attract players from all levels with this difficulty spread of theirs.

Something that is pretty common with all of the difficulties is the presence of streams/roll-y patterns. It makes sense, considering the kind of song *Exitium* is, as it is a pretty fast song with a BPM of 260. Not to mention, all of the charts here are more "rice-oriented", meaning that there is not much LN challenge that will be brought onto each chart. This would mean that most of the difficulty would come from properly reading the rice patterns, as the speed can really make you trip a lot and get confused on certain sections of the chart. Expect a lot of chordjacks, split-trills on the higher difficulties, and as what was mentioned before, streams/roll-y patterns thrown at you.

Honestly, there are many more surprises to come, but I think it's best that players are able to check this out for themselves without spoiling too much. If you want to see more charts that have spreads which are able to let everyone in the community play for fun, then I suggest giving this a positive vote!

While [MapleSyrup-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1192936) is mainly known for his 7K charts, he's also very much capable of charting in the 4K key mode, and [The New Moe Groove](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/738804#mania/1559176) proves his skill very well.

[The New Moe Groove](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/738804#mania/1559176) is a long note chart, focusing more on the release and coordination aspects. This chart was used in a few tournaments, some being the [2019 edition of the osu!mania 4K Philippines Nationals](/wiki/Tournaments/oPHN/2019_4K#semifinals) (1.2x used in the Semifinals round), and the [2nd edition of the osu!mania LN Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/2#round-of-32) (1.0x used in Round of 32). From its usage in tournaments from 2019–2020, this was certainly a popular chart in order to train LN release/coordination fundamentals, as it is able to showcase aspects of different release timings, LN walls, and also density in general.

All in all, this is a great chart for practicing LNs, regardless of skill set, and this being OD 6 gives even newer players a shot at being able to play these kinds of charts, allowing them to have a sort of "entry point" for learning how to release LN properly. It can be very forgiving; however, this will certainly have a very high ceiling in terms of scores, especially with those density sections that players can "metronome" to a certain degree. Regardless, there are many short LNs that can easily throw your momentum off, and it certainly will damage your score quite a bit.

If 1.0x is too easy, rates up to 1.4x are present, and Double Time is certainly an option for many players as well. Considering the wide range of LN skill sets it covers, and also the numerous rates present in the chart, I think that this definitely deserves a lot of attention, and can be used in order to welcome many players into the LN skill set.

Are you a new and upcoming player wanting to learn how to play long notes well? Do you want to relive the older years of LN gameplay? Or do you simply just want to see how well your scores are against many of the best in the world? If your answer is yes to any of them, then I think it's about time we definitely give this chance a shot at Project Loved, and vote yes!

We're going to nominate another nice practice map mapped by qodtjr after months! The song is somewhat well known already, and the map itself is mainly arranged by the chordstream, while arranging some delay bursts for the intense vocal as well. Also, it contains some jumptrill patterns, which may be a good part for you to do some hand adjustment from the brackets and chordstreams but it also can be a barrier that makes it even harder for you to get used to the following brackets after it! All in all, this map is comprehensive, and we have different rates for players with different skills to practice!

If you're interested in this map or song, please vote for us!

*description written by [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785)*

We're back with another K-pop series, featuring the latest set made by [xNett](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4998501)! This is his 3rd pack for you K-pop fans who want even more songs and maps to play, which is even further extension from previous series and different focus compared with his previous 2 packs!

The mapset includes 11 difficulties, and this time there's a hard difficulty designed to help intermediate players get used to playing LNs. But don't relax too much! While the lower diffs are more beginner-friendly, the higher ones still pack a huge amount of pattern variety that demands versatility and coordination. They'll absolutely catch you off guard if you don't know how to time your key presses properly. The higher difficulties feature tons of shields and inverses that you'll need to master if you want to handle the more advanced patterns!

This is currently the last K-pop set that xNett has released so far, and we're really proud of all the work he's contributed to the community, especially for Christmas and the final month of 2025. We hope you enjoy this set, and don't forget to leave a positive vote to give this mapset the recognition it deserves!
