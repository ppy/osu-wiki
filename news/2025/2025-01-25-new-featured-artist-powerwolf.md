Two decades of power metal experience have arrived here on osu!.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/457/header.jpg)

With 22 years and 10 studio albums under their belt, German band **Powerwolf** has made a name for themselves among metalheads and circle clickers alike. Introduced to the Ranked section through [Christ & Combat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1013426), **Powerwolf**'s double-bass-packed tracks serve as both a training ground for stream players and a demonstration of sheer aural intensity.

A total of **14** songs are part of [**Powerwolf**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/457). If you're not picking out a pre-timed `.osz` already, your priorities are out of line.

### [Powerwolf - Christ & Combat](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/457/Blessed%20and%20Possessed/Powerwolf%20-%20Christ%20%26%20Combat.osz)

We've had **Powerwolf** in our backlog for a long time — since before [COE 2024](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2024), where [Optimism](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2064831) blasted through the streams of [Christ & Combat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1013426) by [piroshki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7645522) using only his thumb and index finger. We're not sure how it's possible either, but the proof is here:
