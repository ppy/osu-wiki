Producers and bands aren't the only musicians in osu!'s music library. Vocalist **AKA** is joining the ranks of our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/516/header.jpg)

Inspired by the likes of [*Annabel*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/234), *Hanatan*, *yanaginagi*, *EGOIST*, and *Emi Evans*, **AKA** is a virtual singer from France whose voice resonates with emotion and undeniably elegant tones. Active throughout the doujin and rhythm game spheres, she sings original songs and covers that you might've heard from *Muse Dash*, *Lanota*, *Paradigm:Reboot*, and a bunch of other familiar places!

To an osu! player, the most familiar of those places is [**AKA**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/516), where **8** tracks are pre-timed and ready for mapping!

**AKA** actually made a subtle debut in [*0 K*'s catalogue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/424) with *Panorama*, but more osu! players may recognise her from a couple recently Ranked maps:

[**AKA**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/516) has more songs than that. 4 more to be exact. And they're all about to be mapped by you.

We have two more artists planned for the rest of the year! One this weekend, and another on... another day. Stay tuned.
