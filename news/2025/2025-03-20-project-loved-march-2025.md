Welcome back to 2017!

This week marks the 8th anniversary of my very first scores set in osu!, and thus the anniversary of my involvement with this game. I want to celebrate by nominating [CLICK](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/589494#osu) as March's first *Popular Playcounts* pick. Arles maps are no stranger to the loved section, but what sets this mapset apart are the **SIX** whole additional guest difficulties for you to choose from. Some of osu!'s most well-known graveyarded mappers of this era ‚Äî [Yusomi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4174940), [Settia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2445897), [Necroluttah](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2917471), and more ‚Äî can be found in this set, each providing their unique and recognizable style on this classic dnb remix.

I have very fond memories of these mappers and their maps, and I hope this nomination can convey some of those same feelings to you all. Enjoy!

*description written by [momoyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12469536)*

[CENSORED!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/489566#osu) is such an awesome mapset.

Ranging from 1‚òÖ to 6.4‚òÖ difficulties, this set doesn't disappoint. Simple yet engaging, easy yet hard, this set has a big audience yet to be reached! And I have to admit, I truly respect the dedication the mapper put into this, with the years of mapping and remapping ever since 2016 until he was satisfied. Such efforts caught my attention and I truly believe this mapset deserves to be Loved.

Please consider playing this. You will definitely not be disappointed in the slightest.

It's all hazy to me now, but I remember stumbling upon this map for the first time and thinking ‚Äî wow, this is new. Like, *new* new. Different, and charming. I grew fond of tech maps since, all thanks to [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328) among many others. That was 8‚Äì9 years ago. Looking back at it now, it still feels as fresh as it was before, like it hasn't aged a bit. Funny how my memory serves me ‚Äî it's why I keep coming back.

Anyways, this is my pick for *Outstanding Oldies*: rrtyui's [NEW Astronomas](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/442034#osu) from 2016. I would say that this is a bit of a hidden classic, but I can only speak for myself. If you've never heard of it, I'm gonna let the map speak for itself ‚Äî give it a go, and you'll see what I'm onto.

It's about time! This month's *Small Spectacles* slot is going straight to [hamano](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9714032) for his incredible illustration of [boa - Twilight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2088022#osu/4375662). This map is a masterful representation of the chaos and intensity in the track, skillfully captured through each unsettling slider shape and intricate flow pattern. With custom hitsounds turned on, the map takes on a whole new dimension, telling a hauntingly unique story that'll send chills down your spine üëªüëª.

In all seriousness, *Twilight* is a truly creative piece that perfectly embodies the wild lyricism and eerie themes in boa's work. It's the kind of map that draws you into its dark, twisted atmosphere and keeps you hooked until the very last note. This is definitely one for the books, so don't forget to cast your vote and show some love for this amazing creation!

Vote yes, and let this map shine! üåü

A known mapset among mappers, [8284 vs. wa. - Adularescence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/733702#osu) is a popular BMS track featuring iconic guest difficulty mappers such as [UndeadCapulet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2523533), [gowww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/119404), [squishyguppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4116573), [Flower](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1033017) and [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669)!

Mapped back in the big old 2018, he clearly managed to add all sorts of spices to the mix.

He clearly put every ingredient he could into this mapset.

This mapset is the definition of mixing every legendary mapper possible and putting them all together in a very enjoyable techy alt map. Believe me, I enjoyed this map very much and I'm glad to be able to help this be Loved by the community!

A mapset based on clean and elegant patterning, *Fly Me To The Moon* features a mix of 140 BPM jumps and dynamic streams that perfectly capture the vibe of this vaporwave rendition, while also creating a decent aim control challenge at 5.97‚òÖ. And to really amp up the experience, be sure to immerse yourself by enabling the storyboard and hitsounds!

Being graveyarded since 2022, I think it's time that this map finds a welcome home in the Loved section, and if you think so too, cast your vote!

This map makes me feel like a Victorian-era child eating a hot cheeto for the first time.

[Heilia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9823042) can only be described as an absolute wizard in the editor, and this map of [Komorinu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1964563#osu) is what happens when you let him cook. This map is straight gas from start to finish, with gnarly full-screen sliders and crazy improvised rhythms. Of course, it's not just fun to watch in the editor, as the heavy tech and aim control elements make for a varied, unique, and particularly brutal playing experience. If this all feels a little too high-octane for you, legendary mapper [AIR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2070688) has also offered a fantastic guest difficulty in their iconic style.

Heilia is one of my favorite mappers right now, and this map might just be his best work yet. I hope you enjoy!

And when that final kiai hits... it's pure bliss as you lock in one last time to complete this piece.

[Marmalade butcher - Amanita](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1720005#taiko) mapped by [sendol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4433058) was used in [TWC 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2023) and the [Taiko Suiji Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/TSC), making it a very famous and challenging mapset.

At first glance, this mapset looks like it was made for tournaments, but it contains three unique difficulties that allow you to improve your skills while playing the map with the difficulty level that suits you best!

One of the most noteworthy points is the difference in difficulty between Inner Oni and the X diff. If you are a beginner, you might think you have mastered Inner Oni and become a tech professional, but not so much with the X diff! The ending with the complex 1/6 + 1/8 snaps are so difficult that they might make your fingers cry... ;-;

Play this mapset and hone your skills in preparation for TWC 2025!!

For those who are still unfamiliar with sepiarecorders' tracks, listening to the kiai of this map will probably give you a good idea. osu!taiko has gotten some amazing maps with songs from this artist over the past two years.

One of these masterpieces is [Nascence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062816#taiko) mapped by [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719). uone manages to capture this eerie (yet playful and experimental) vibe of this sepiarecorders track extremely well with silly snappings and doubles in between regular patterns.

If you're a veteran tech player (or new upcoming tech talent) I am sure you will enjoy this map a lot. If this map is still a bit too daunting for you, I recommend trying it with the Half Time mod, or trying to counter the high SV with the Easy mod! Whatever your skill level is, I think everyone should check out this masterpiece.

Make sure to vote for uone's *Nascence* this month if you're one of the many people who love this beatmap!

Can't Believe 2021 was 12 years ago...

[Hello (BPM) 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1393879) is the track that kicked off Camellia's Hello series. By amping up 1 maximum BPM to the track every year, this has been one of the most anticipated song series by electronic music fans all over the world following new year's day. This is also, coincidentally, the year of the last [Socus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10196449) Loved map, which is crazy to think due to all of the amazing maps made by them.

This map, with an insane star rating of **10.78‚òÖ**, fully portrays the chaotic atmosphere with insanely dense patterns and extreme SV. It definitely qualifies as a map to conquer for all the drum decimators out there! Don't forget to vote for this map if you want to see some crazy scores and replays for this map!

osu!aiko players really have a soft spot for rated maps. [REDALiCE feat. Ayumi Nomiya - Little Star (Full Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1348450#taiko/2792245) by [Konpaku Sariel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/533502) is a simple, yet engaging stream map that stays fun even as it becomes faster, no matter how small the rate increase is. It's no wonder the mapset has amassed a whopping 10K plays and has seen its presence on the tournament scene too.

Konpaku himself is a rather known mapper and player in the community, which gives the mapset a good pedigree, enough for you to at least give it a try (if you already haven't that is). Go ahead, you will always have the last say after all!

Hello, it's [applerss time](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9TPkCBhNa3E)! Everyone's been waiting for it! This time the map is [Azure Moon - J.I.N.S.E.I](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1338939#taiko/2773870), made by [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349)!

This is a very challenging map with high-level difficulties typical of applerss! The lifeless difficulty in particular has very stimulating patterns, including 1/6 snaps in a 300 BPM streams, making it challenging for high-level players!

On the other hand, Inner Oni is mainly composed of 1/4 rhythms, so even if you're not a big fan of fast BPMs, it's a very good map to practise on, so please play it!

We are looking forward to everyone liking it!

Over the years, the top difficulty of [Kobaryo - PLASTIC BUNNY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/612124#taiko/1291919) by [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349) has been a rite of passage for the greatest and fastest speed players. At 370 BPM and 9.23‚òÖ it is no wonder [PLASTIC BUNNY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/612124#taiko/1291919) has garnered a reputation as a true limit test.

Unlike many high-BPM maps in Ranked which have simpler patterns with colour changes on most 1/4 patterning due to the high BPM, [PLASTIC BUNNY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/612124#taiko/1291919) has a mixture of colour changes or keeping the same colour when going into or out of 370 BPM bursts. This requires you to have absolute control due to the wide variety of patterning (especially the longer patterns which rarely repeat). The final test in the top difficulty is the last kiai, which is even denser and includes some longer patterns! For those looking for an easier (although still difficult) challenge, there is also an Inner Oni which has lower density and considerably shorter patterns!

Enjoy and take care!

This set features many skillsets being pushed to the limit (as of players' skill in 2025 anyway)! From high CS, speed, tech, low AR, you name it, this pack has it. Good luck to anyone who tries this set, because there is not a single player in the game who won't get a good challenge out of it!

There are a lot of very difficult maps with Camellia songs, but what if you want to play something easier for a change? This map by -Izayoi might be exactly what you are looking for.

Don't get me wrong, it is still not easy! But I'm pretty sure a lot of players will be able to keep up with it just fine. As long as you have the stamina and speed required to play through the fast-paced patterns, you should be able to pass it. The difficulty increases throughout the map, so don't let it catch you off guard. For players that aren't good enough to play the top diff, the set also includes a Rain difficulty which is significantly easier and very accessible to aspiring players.

This month in Project Loved we are featuring one of the most popular low-AR HD tournament maps of the past couple of years, [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636)'s map of [Hyper Bass](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1622010#fruits/3311584). Combining low approach rate with simple yet sharp streams makes this a great practice map for the Hidden fans. Feeling a bit frisky? Throwing on Double Time isn't bad as it is only AR 8! A must-play if you are a fan of the simplistic map style with some non-standard difficulty settings.

This is one of [Orca-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7958845)'s most iconic classics, and I think it defines their clean execution of concepts and style most effectively. If you are familiar with [Mafain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569493), this is essentially a spiritual sequel to it.

Built for the Grand Finals of the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2023#grand-finals), this is a really fast-paced, flamboyant display of what Orca- has made themselves known for. Full of stutters, brutal transitions, various repetitive gimmicks, and speed changes all over the place, we get a challenging SV map, but it's honestly really fun to just take on at face value, perhaps to learn the SV skillset the hard way if you're up for it!

Rest assured, the voting thread is 100% safe for work! You can go ahead and push those buttons with a free conscience. Go!

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951) is known for creating many charts that involve jumpstreams and handstreams, and [St. Scarhand](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1520413#mania/3111751) is definitely no exception to that.

In general, what makes this chart so challenging is not just the jumpstreams and handstreams that are present in this chart, but also how they are charted, alongside having additional patterns that can throw a sightreading player off. Unsuspecting players might not be aware that the start does not necessarily reflect how hard the rest of the chart is, as this is one of those maps where it gets a bit denser as the map goes on.

It doesn't even end there. Stuff like jumptrills, rolls, and even index streams are present in this chart. There are so many elements in this chart, that they can really throw anyone off if they are not careful. Did I forget to mention that there are also a few long notes in this chart? That can also make you uncomfortable, especially given how there are streams mapped alongside the LNs (good luck accurately releasing that ending by the way).

The silver lining is that the base rate of the chart is at 180 BPM, which is not exactly the most uncomfortable BPM for jumpstream/handstream charts. Should you master the chart at 1.0x, however, there are rates up to 1.4x for you to try and see how well you can still execute those patterns at higher rates.

This chart is a great example of how versatile [IcyWorld](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1383951)'s charting is, and it is no surprise that this chart was played by so many people across the world. If you think that this is a great chart as well, then I think it's about time we vote "Yes" and give this a favorable vote!

[DatManOvaDer - Busta Rhymes Goes To The Wii Shop Channel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957735#mania) by [Punnies](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8700468)\

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Busta Rhymes Goes To The Wii Shop Channel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957735#mania/2005089) is quite a short chart, lasting only 58 seconds. However, this chart is extremely difficult, containing three difficulties of increasing difficulty.

The entire theme of this chart is chordjacks. Most of the 58 seconds in this chart is a relentless set of chordjacks with rarely any breaks. While this does not sound too difficult, a lot of chordjack charts at the very least give you some sort of break section and they typically last a bit longer. Meanwhile, this one only gives you a few seconds to take a breather before going back to continuous chordjacks.

From [Wii Jack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957735#mania/2005089) to [Wii Jack+](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957735#mania/2009882) and finally [Wii Jack++](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957735#mania/2006488), the chart becomes increasingly dense. While [Wii Jack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957735#mania/2005089) might be tolerable for a lot of players, [Wii Jack++](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/957735#mania/2006488) can start to feel daunting to even some of the best players in the world. Whilst the lowest difficulty of this chart contains some hands and occasionally some quads, the highest difficulty contains hands and quads extremely often, with hands replacing virtually almost every jump that is present in the chart. This could be deadly as the presence of anchors can really make you exhausted in the latter parts of this chart.

[Punnies](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8700468) did an amazing job charting something so difficult within a minute, and at the same time being able to make a chart that is still fun to play for a wide range of players. It's no wonder so many people have played this chart already, and from that alone, I think it's about time this chart deserves a "Yes" vote for Loved!

What? Is this some sort of joke? April fools is NEXT month, you know...

...is what I'd imagine some of you are currently thinking to yourselves. Well, against all odds, this is very serious. Yes. [inteliser](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1824775)'s chart of [Fastest Crash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1385168#mania/2861591). You are seeing that correctly.

For those who've never heard of this chart, I'm sure you're questioning if this really is a joke, as the background for it is quite... interesting? All I can say is that I'd be lying if I said it didn't reflect the actual chart itself, BUT, it doesn't mean that the approach itself has nobody who enjoys it, as there's quite the audience for this chart!

It's quite the challenge to explain how the chart plays or feels since you really do question what exactly you're playing when it comes down to the overall feeling of the chart. Even then, what makes it so surprising is that every note DOES, in fact, follow the music accurately, leading it to create this very confusing feeling in which your brain tells you it's right, while your fingers tell you it's wrong. Or maybe you really just like one-hand trills that go into a minijack. I don't know. Suit yourself.

Somehow, I managed to write an entire description about this chart without bringing up the absurdly deceiving low star rating (until now), and with that fact brought up, I can now tell you to go into the thread and vote for this.

What makes this chart so great is that there are so many difficulties that can provide players of all levels a great experience. Regardless of whether you are a beginner or a veteran, there is so much fun that you can have with this chart. This being 4 minutes and 30 seconds long gives you not only a challenge of consistency, but it certainly allows you to have so much fun with the flowy nature of a lot of the difficulties here.

There are so many surprises that these charts can provide, such as SVs, some long notes, and rolls. As for the rest? We'll let you figure that out on your own. If you want to have fun on many different levels of gameplay, then I suggest it's about time to finally get this chart into Loved, by giving it a YES vote!

Another slow LN release chart, [Shinunoga E-Wa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1916300#mania/3953965) is certainly one that requires a lot of focus to play, and [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991) and [RuleBlazing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7312402) have certainly created something that will test even some of the best players in the world on their LN release skill.

The physicality requirement may not be too high, which could lead to more S ranks in general; however, what makes this chart extremely difficult is being able to increase that accuracy, to go up to the 98s and 99s, and eventually being able to SS this chart. This chart not being fast can be a deadly combination, especially if you are not prepared for what is about to come. Releases are present all across the entirety of the 3 minutes this chart has, and overall, can really make you uncomfortable should you not be familiar with how slow releases work.

Overall, this LN release chart is a great practice for your fundamentals, as patterns like this are present on faster charts as well. If you want to see how you fare on slow releases against the rest of the world, or at the very least, have more charts like this recognized in the scene, then let's give this chart a YES vote and push it to Loved!

Each map is designed to help players learn and master different skillsets, with carefully balanced difficulty levels to make the learning curve smoother and more manageable.

We're proud to present this pack to the community, offering a gateway for players to delve deeper into the world of 10K. We hope you'll support our goal by casting a positive vote for this pack!
