Hot on the heels of the breathtaking [Lazer Grand Arena](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA/2025), the osu! World Cup mappooling team is already hard at work, shifting gears into full motion for the next OWC season. Today, we are looking for **mappers** and **playtesters**, two essential roles that have played a vital part in the tournament's continued success over the years.

In case you've been living under a rock for the past decade, the [osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC) is our annual country-based tournament, organised by the osu! team in collaboration with many community members. Held since 2011, it's widely regarded as the pinnacle of competitive osu!, bringing together the world's top players and countries to compete at the highest level — the perfect way to close out the year for both participants and spectators alike.

If you wish to help in the creation of standout projects like [Lies playing Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ZaTeibemI), [AJITAMA Adventure OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJwkUiu5Bbo), [Operation: Zenithfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r459I7A-Rds), and many others, let us know via one of the forms below:

**[Click here to apply as a mapper](https://leoflt.com/forms/owc2025-mapping-apps)**

**[Click here to apply as a playtester](https://leoflt.com/forms/owc2025-testing-apps)**

*Please note: If accepted into either role, you will no longer be eligible to participate as a player in the tournament. Both forms require authentication via your osu! account for identification purposes.*

The World Cup team will forever be grateful for your future contributions to the project!
