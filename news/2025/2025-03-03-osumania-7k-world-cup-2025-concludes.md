![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-03-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes/banner.jpg)

What an amazing year this was! Not only did we get to experience a new take on the 7K World Cup with the plethora of changes that have been made to the format and production value of the series, but we may have got to witness the most exciting tournament to date. From new teams becoming legends overnight, to old rivalries clashing once (or twice) again this year.

While we have tons to cover for the Grand Finals recap, let's take a quick break to congratulate this year's champions, shall we?

## Summary

![MWC 7K 2025 podium](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K/img/mwc7k2025-podium.jpg)

Congratulations to ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea for winning 2025's first official World Cup! With this win, South Korea has amassed a total of **13 total osu!mania World Cup wins** under their belt between 4K and 7K, 8 of them being in 7K. A feat easier said than done!

While South Korea's dominance over 7K is not news to anyone, it's easy to understand the Herculean effort behind such an accomplishment. This year's teams were no joke. Competition only ever got fiercer with the increase in the bracket size, and despite the extra hurdles, South Korea remains as the undisputed champion of 2025! We'd like to extend our deepest congratulations to the team for their well deserved victory.

For those who'd wish to skip to this week's highlights, we've got you covered [down below](#grand-finals-recap)!

![Grand Finals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-03-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes/mappool.jpg)

Grand Finals mappools have always been notorious for their difficulty. And this one is no exception! In fact, the trend from past years shows that it's becoming increasingly more difficult to play with every passing year. This paradigm shift forced teams to play outside their comfort zones, who had to play while pushing their very limits.

We had a couple returning [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#official-tournament-releases) such as [DJ Raisei - T.R.A.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325366#mania/4984357) (EX1) made by [aci](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9650304) and originally featured in the [osu! World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2022), and [TWC Sound Team "Xurv Stasis Rasufim" - Kaze no Denwa (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325116#mania/4983795) (RC5) mapped by [pwhk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4887865) and first seen in the [osu!taiko World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024). What no one was expecting was that the round would feature only one new track — little did we know, quality would far surpass quantity!

Speaking of EX1, that was one of this week's standouts! [aci](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9650304)'s MWC 7K debut comes with an absolutely nightmarish map. Those familiar with aci's work know how extreme their maps can be, making this a perfect fit for the slot. The relentless nature of the map forced players to perform at their best, as even the smallest mistakes can be very costly.

The second map highlight-worthy was [Raimukun - Nyarlathotep's Dreamland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325126#mania/4983819) (LN2) by [Enie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11976455), who was able to perfectly capture a new style of LN Density by featuring a lot longer long notes. To no one's surprise, this map posed a considerable challenge for the players, and understandably so! The map is really dense, yet Despite the dense patterning, the chart also incorporates a generous amount of comfortable patterns that somewhat offsets the difficulty brought on by its density.

But what about the new track that was teased a couple paragraphs ago? Fret not, for we wanted to give it the attention it deserves, alongside its artist who will be joining us as a Featured Artist moving forward. Drum roll, please!

</div>

This week's big surprise was actually twofold! Not only did we get to witness an amazing **9 minutes** long track and tiebreaker beatmap to go along with it, but also we got the announcement that its artist, [Ludicin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/459), will be joining osu!'s [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists)!

[Lost Requiem](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325151#mania/4983858) can be briefly described as this tournament's magnum opus. Mapped by [_Kobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713), [_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750), [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196), [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525), [ExNeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7590894), [U1d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10125072), and even [Ludicin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8659666) themselves, this relentless marathon is a direct result of all creative minds in the team being put into use! This was not only an affair between the artist and the mappers, but one where multiple teams collaborated to complete one of osu!'s most ambitious projects to date.

The graphics team worked overtime with this one. Not only was the map accompanied by a groundbreaking storyboard by the hands of [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436) and [binarie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15632854), but also a showcase video worthy of admiration produced by [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) and [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991) with the trusty help of [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024). If that wasn't enough, [KM](https://twitter.com/KM2650223087343) and [Zeth](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966) with their beautiful illustrations and graphics respectively put the cherry on top of an already impressive cake.

Suffice to say, the team is very proud of the work. Seeing the community's breathtaking reaction put everyone at ease. We can confidently say their efforts did not go to waste, and this map alone is a testament to the team's dedication for the tournament!

## Grand Finals recap

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **China** ::{ flag=CN }:: | **7** | 5 | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines |
| **All-stars Red** | **7** | 6 | All-stars Blue |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **7** | 0 | ::{ flag=CN }:: China |

All good things must come to an end. And this World Cup is no exception. That said, this year's grand finale hasn't left us short of surprises! Not only did we get to witness this year's winning match between South Korea and China, but also the conclusion of the Philippines' battle against their nemesis throughout the tournament — that being China. We even got to witness a show match between one of osu!mania's best sets of 7K players to date!

Suffice to say, there's a lot to go over despite the reduced number of matches. We also got a set of [interviews](#interviews) prepared to gain some insight from the creative team involved in this week's osu! original showcase plus an interview with South Korea as this year's winners. Don't miss out on these!

And how could we forget the amazing video recap by the hands of [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895), [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550), and [Nerfox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7976724) who have been working overtime throughout the last couple of months to churn out these amazing, easily digestible recaps.

Without further ado, let's get into last week's match highlight. And contrary to what you may be expecting, this wasn't the match to decide the victors but rather its runner-up!

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines

</div>

Coming in hot from their Semifinals match, China and the Philippines faced off once again after China's initial 6–4 score. This made it possible for China to achieve their first Grand Finals appearance since 2022! However, the Philippines came back stronger than before after their hard-fought victory against Japan, seeking revenge for their previous loss. This made for one of the most intense and nerve-wracking matches of Grand Finals — let alone the entire tournament!

Unsurprisingly, both teams stuck to their original strategies. While China opted to focus on the rice pool by protecting [DJ Raisei - T.R.A.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325366#mania/4984357) (EX1) and banning [Ludicin - Signal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325160#mania/4983871) (HB2), the Philippines protected [Aoi - excez](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325127#mania/4983820) (LN1) and banned [BilliumMoto - 100 Carat Smoke Point](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325114#mania/4983791) (RC4). China's strategy proved to be the successful one, winning them their first pick on the protected map by a landslide 73,986-point lead.

The Philippines quickly responded by picking [Raimukun - Nyarlathotep's Dreamland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325126#mania/4983819) (LN2). China adjusted by switching players to ::{ flag=CN }:: [[Crz]Satori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082178) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [VanWilder](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/89545) to counter the long note–heavy chart. The Philippines held their ground, however, scoring a comfortable first win thanks to ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405)'s as the MVP of the match and their impressive 978,133 score.

This initial back-and-forth was an omen of what was to come, with each team dominating their respective picks. During this skirmish, there were some notable moments such as the Philippines' choice of [rejection - Aimai Attitude (feat. Nakamura Sanso)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325129#mania/4983823) (LN3) and [Aoi - excez](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325127#mania/4983820) (LN1) which were promptly won by them, or the Chinese rice counter-attack with [Junk - Aihana](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325135#mania/4983834) (RC3), allowing ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) to excel with a full combo 983,858 score.

Both teams traded blows up until the scoreboard hit the 5–5 mark. A critical point for both teams! China stayed true to their strategy and picked [Super Psychic Fujy - Dark Avatara Beam (Le Dos-on Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325303#mania/4984227) (RC2). Much to everyone's surprise, this resulted in a much narrower score gap than anticipated. With ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405)'s flawless performance of 987,636 points, the Philippines got incredibly close to winning! Much to their dismay however, China won the pick by a relatively slim margin of 8,704 points, squeezing the very last points they could on the map's ending.

With the scoreboard at 6–5 in China's favour, the Philippines had to make a tough choice: [MisomyL - Coming*True!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325139#mania/4983838) (HB1) or [Genesis - Absolute Evil](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325148#mania/4983851) (EX3). They ultimately chose the former, a reasonable choice due to its easier patterns and lower physical demands which benefited their team. The Philippines started strong, taking an early lead, but with ::{ flag=PH }:: [sanni666](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3036686) and ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405)'s unfortunate misses, China was allowed to regain their footing. Despite a flurry of misses coming from both sides in the final stretch of the map, the Philippines' mistakes proved very costly, and China claimed the last victory they needed with a 2,786-point lead, denying the Philippines' final chance to come back and thus, their win.

Both teams delivered a performance worthy of admiration, making the match very thrilling and unpredictable up until the very end. Congratulations to China, who were now able to face off against South Korea in the last match of the tournament! The Philippines also deserves our utmost praise for their efforts, making every match they were in very entertaining to watch. We hope to see them return even stronger in the future to reclaim the 7K World Cup Champions title that they once held!

## Score highlights

Some of the scores we saw throughout the Grand Finals weekend put the cherry on the top of what has already been a very special MWC 7K cake. It's really hard to pick individual scores from such performant players, however. In light of this, we've decided to highlight one player from each team to spotlight their best performing scores!

- Of the many charts ::{ flag=PH }:: [Ojisan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11420405) has played last weekend, including the show match, their performance on [rejection - Aimai Attitude (feat. Nakamura Sanso)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325129#mania/4983823) (LN3) (980k) and [MisomyL - Coming*True!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325139#mania/4983838) (HB1) (972k) were mesmerising.
- With our jaws wide open from before, we now have space to put in ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904)'s sublime runs on [Himeringo - Kodoku no Kakurenbo (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325113#mania/4983786) (RC1) (974k) and [Nanahoshi Kangengakudan feat. Hatsune Miku - No.39](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325120#mania/4983811) (RC6) (968k) in our mouths.
- Rounding out our carbohydrate-rich osu!mania 7K diet, ::{ flag=KR }:: [yz1155](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008) barged in with plenty more spoonfuls of rice with their impressive scores on [BilliumMoto - 100 Carat Smoke Point](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325114#mania/4983791) (RC4) (966k) and [DJ Raisei - T.R.A.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325366#mania/4984357) (EX1) (954k).

That said, we want to call back some of the most impressive scores we witnessed throughout the tournament! Even in earlier rounds, we got to witness some of the best performances of the entire tournament.

- ::{ flag=CN }:: [af-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10512663) and ::{ flag=PH }:: [sanni666](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3036686) surprised everyone in the [Round of 32](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-24-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-round-of-32-recap) with their 991k+ scores on [Neko Hacker - Shadows feat. Such](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2307450#mania/4934981) (LN1). These scores in the LN inverse category were *arguably* the best ones in the category throughout the entire tournament!
- And why were the previous scores *arguably* the best? Well, that's because the crown of the jewel had to be ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586)'s run during the [Round of 16](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-31-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-round-of-16-recap) on [Phoenix Legend - She Xiang Fu Ren (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2310775#mania/4943407) (LN1) with its 994k+ full combo score, rivaling even the best of scores in other categories!
- Last but not least, ::{ flag=KR }:: [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406) technical prowess was showcased on [The Flashbulb - Six Acid Strings](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318102#mania/4964713) (RC4) during the [Semifinals](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-02-13-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap) with an amazing score of 991k.

Again, highlighting the best of the best scores is no easy task. If we could, we'd highlight them all!

## osu! originals

It is very easy to underestimate the effort being put into the commissioning process behind every single brand-new track. And yet despite all odds, this year's 7K World Cup has given us **7** new [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#official-tournament-releases) for the osu! community to enjoy! This year was able to boast of a wide variety of genres. Moreover, artists previously uninvolved with commissions such as [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220) have taken their chance to debut in this year's tournament!

Our first interview of the week was with none other than South Korea's team captain, [yz1155](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008) alongside their teammates! We want to get some insight into the team's thoughts after winning one of MWC 7K's most exciting tournaments to date, both due to its plethora of changes and given how competitive this year seemed to be. And who better knows about the osu!mania World Cup series than a team as experienced as South Korea's?

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063">RandomeLoL</a></p>

Congratulations to the team for the win! What are the team's overall thoughts on the series thus far? What has been the team's strategy this year as opposed to previous ones? As a player, how has the evolution of World Cups felt? Has it affected the way you guys played in any noticeable way?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/yz1155.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008">yz1155</a></p>

Everyone may have slightly different opinions about this year's tournament, but our entire team agrees that the introduction of Round of 32 and the EX category in the mappools were both a great addition. Moreover, the overall quality of the mappools was great!

South Korea's main strategy was simple and clear: focusing on the opponent's weak point. Of course, teams like Japan and China are surprisingly strong. However, no matter how strong a team is, no one is a jack of all trades and a master of all. When we had a match with Japan, our team focused on LN and HB, and with team China, we focused on RC picks. I believe our strength was our balanced skill set, so this strategy proved effective in every round. This is basically the same approach we took in previous tournaments, and unless SV picks are added we'll probably not be changing strategies any time soon.

As one of the players involved, I have noticed how the team has tried new and challenging things this year. Our team had a great time with these changes! While there will always be opposing opinions when testing the waters and all should equally be respected, I hope that the mappooling team will not be swayed by them. Any reasonable participant with the correct attitude and mindset should be grateful for the staff's efforts!

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063">RandomeLoL</a></p>

With this year's win, South Korea currently boasts of 13 wins across both 4K and 7K. How do you think South Korea has been able to maintain their dominance? As a captain, how do you decide who gets to play when the country's skill ceiling is this high?

Well, the main reason South Korea has achieved first place many times in the MWC so far would have to be our significantly longer VSRG history, especially in 7K. Because of this, it is only natural for more experienced and skilled players to have grown up in South Korea. This same fact applies to other strong countries with VSRG history such as Japan, China, or the Philippines.

This does not mean that we're "overwhelmingly" better than others, such as Japan's taiko dominance. As time goes by and VSRGs get played in other countries, the skill gaps will end up gradually decreasing. Knowing this, we do not know what would happen if more people started to play osu!mania and participated in the MWC in the future. Unfortunately, not all nations are as active as South Korea is, and as long as that's the case, it will be very hard for other countries to catch up.

If I had to point out another reason, it might be that South Koreans have grown up in an extremely competitive environment, which could have influenced their skill improvements in gaming as a whole. However, I don't really see VSRGs as a competition at all, so I can't say for sure how much that has influenced others.

To me, these games are like Minecraft: a sandbox where we can play however we want! For example, we have multiple categories and play styles to choose from, such as LN, rice, hybrid, etc... just to name a few. After all, the main goal of a game is to have fun, especially with friends all around the world. When you're enjoying a game with friends, is there any more compelling reason than to enjoy the moment with them?

It's hard to ignore all the changes that have taken place this year. How does the team feel about these changes, in particular the change to the mappool format? What about the addition of Round of 32, has this made the tournament ever so slightly more competitive?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7304158" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Crusher.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7304158">Crusher</a></p>

In my opinion, the tournament has definitely improved from previous years thanks to the addition of Round of 32 and the EX category. These changes made the tournament more competitive and interesting. In fact, these were quite attractive and necessary to players. As the length of the tournament is longer than last year's, there were more things to see. The production value of the tournament has increased, and the addition of Round of 32 gave more players a chance to play in MWC compared to before. Ultimately, I believe this was the key to make MWC 7K as big as it was this year. The pools need to adapt to the players' rapid increase of skill, which is why I think the addition of the EX bracket was a good choice! I believe trying out new things will always be something positive for the tournament.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/dressurf.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406">dressurf</a></p>

I believe extending the bracket to the Round of 32 provided a fresh and exciting atmosphere for the event. If more people participate in the MWC in the future, it seems fine keeping up the Round of 32 next year too. It would be a net positive to improve the tournament's atmosphere. My only nitpick was that the EX mappool didn't really feel as hard as the name may've suggested. Other than that, I'm really thankful for the team's efforts this year by providing such great mappools! I had a great time playing them all.

I want to praise whoever suggested adding the Round of 32. For me, World Cups aren't just a competition to determine a team's rank, but rather a joyful international event for gamers. There are hardly any events in 7K after all, so the World Cup is the only event where we get to enjoy this environment. It's just my very subjective opinion, but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter which team wins. The most important thing is for everyone to enjoy this "fiesta"!

More than likely, [Ludicin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8659666) needs little to no introduction! This is, in fact, not their first rodeo in the game as they've previously composed [Echoes of Memoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2214238#mania/4691422) for [The Perennial 2024](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1924994?n=1), as well as the [myriad of Ranked sets](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=artist%3D%22%22Ludicin%22%22) they were featured in!

More perspicacious members in the community know that you're not new to the game. For how long have you been interested in VSRGs? What about osu!mania interested you the most?

I've been playing rhythm games for quite some time now. I think around 2008, I was introduced to rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero, and then I found out about osu!mania when my brother was playing it back in 2016.

What interested me about osu!mania was the convenience of playing on a keyboard. It was really easy to boot up the game and start playing. After that, I’ve just been playing ever since.

Really, I’ve always wanted to do something with music, even before playing rhythm games. I’ve been making music for a long time and have always created what I enjoy listening to. The fact that people also like what I make and that it has helped them in some way is really cool to see.

It's hard to understate the effort that must've gone into the tiebreaker. What was the inspiration behind it? How closely intertwined was the collaboration between you, the design team, and the map poolers?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8659666" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Ludicin.jpg')"></a>

I honestly have been wanting to make an orchestral song like this for a while, so when the osu! team reached out to me about making a Grand Finals tiebreaker, I figured it would have been fitting.

The only idea I really had for this song was that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world. I wasn’t too involved in the design process since I wanted every designer involved to have the freedom to build upon my initial concept. Seeing everyone's ideas come together and work so well was really cool to witness.

To many people's surprise, this year's design team had two well-known osu!mania users on board! While some users may already know about [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991) and [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604)'s side hustles having seen their work throughout the years, fewer people know about their involvement in the World Cup design team. With that said, we'd like to hear about their creative thought process for this tournament.

Both of you are well-known in the mania 4K tournament scene. Can you each briefly introduce yourselves and share what sparked your interest in applying to join the World Cup design team as visual effect designers?

Hello! Most people might know me for mapping in multiple community tournaments, or more infamously, for the SV maps in MWC 4K 2023 and 2024. What some may not know is that I have been doing graphic design and visual effects since 2022, but I became more active in design last year thanks to multiple opportunities I was given throughout the osu! community.

The main reason I was interested in joining the World Cup Design Team was the high-quality and well-thought-out designs I saw in previous osu! originals. This sparked my interest in contributing designs for osu! originals while also gaining new experience from fellow designers. I'm very glad I was given this opportunity to debut my visual effects work in Lost Requiem through the World Cup Design Team.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/CrewK.jpg')"></a>

Hi, I'm CrewK. If you've been playing mania 4K for a long time, you might know me as a former MWC 4K player from 2019 to 2024 — just a regular MWC enthusiast.

The event that most inspired me to apply as a VFX designer was seeing [Purple Palace](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569527#mania/3205077)'s showcase in person on MWC 4K 2021. The elation I felt when the original music was released still resonates with me, and I've always hoped to create something that could excite the community in the same way.

I also started making videos under the name "rua" about two years ago, hoping to use the experience I gained there to showcase my work someday. Now, I'm truly honored to present the fruits of my labor on such a big stage. If you're interested, feel free to check out more of my work as "rua" ([@rua_alfalfa](https://x.com/rua_alfalfa)).

Despite being your first design project for the World Cups, you were immediately thrown into working on the challenging Grand Finals tiebreaker project, known to require extensive planning and meticulous execution. How did you approach the theme of the song to develop a plan that would translate into a cohesive visual storytelling? Given the song's cinematic opening, were there any key elements you wanted to emphasize during the design process?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/TheFunk.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991">TheFunk</a></p>

Before we were assigned to the Grand Finals tiebreaker project, we were given some design requirements to follow, which served as stepping stones for both me and CrewK during the design process. After seeing KM's artwork and hearing Ludicin's song, the design team brainstormed lore ideas that could work well, allowing us to create a story for the first minute of the song while maintaining a connection between the song and artwork.

Some of the lore concepts included showing the players' or spectators' perspectives from a camera as they help Ludicin and Mani (the 7K mascot) uncover something within the ruins. An important relic or object was discovered inside a dome-shaped building, which we referenced from the artwork as it was a prominent element.

The song's opening was different from previous tiebreakers, taking a more cinematic approach. CrewK and I tried our best to make it look like a movie with the ruined buildings and scenic looks during our process with a lot of references from KM's artwork. With the collaboration of Sakura006, we were also able to implement character animations, making the scenes feel more immersive and realistic.

After seeing the Grand Finals tiebreaker being showcased, I'm very happy with the end product that CrewK, Sakura006, and I created for the video. We also couldn't have achieved this without [KM](https://twitter.com/KM2650223087343)'s fantastic illustrations, [Zeth](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966)'s graphic design, and [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436) and [binarie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15632854)'s storyboard work which covered the remaining sections of the song!

The team production process was exactly as TheFunk described. Since brainstorming isn't my strong suit, I'm extremely grateful for TheFunk's proactive support.

To add a few details about the production, we focused heavily on the overall color tone of the scenes to make them feel more cinematic. We experimented extensively to create a majestic atmosphere that wasn't too bright or too dark, perfectly complementing the music. Additionally, I carefully adjusted the timing of Ludicin's reveal from the blacked-out silhouette. After consideration, we determined that the best moment for the reveal was at 1:02, when the music reaches a climactic point. By synchronizing the reveal with the peak of the song, we aimed to enhance the sense of excitement and surprise for the song composer announcement.

Most of your past designs have been solo work. What was it like working in a collaborative design process? What advantages did it have over your solo experiences?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/TheFunk.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991">TheFunk</a></p>

This was my first time collaborating with another designer on visual effects, and I had a blast working with CrewK. It was fun getting to know him and seeing his approach to design. We frequently exchanged opinions and ideas on how we wanted the video to look while also sharing design assets to ensure visual consistency across all scenes.

Working together had its unique advantages as well. Since we both used the same software, it was easy to communicate ideas and make adjustments to enhance the visuals. Splitting the workload allowed us to complete scenes more efficiently, and having another person provide built-in quality assurance, which is something solo work lacks. Instead of relying solely on personal judgment, we could critique and refine each other's scenes.

Given the opportunity, I would be happy to work with CrewK again or collaborate with other designers of the World Cup Design Team.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/CrewK.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604">CrewK</a></p>

I believe that one of the biggest advantages of collaborative work is the ability to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, ultimately improving the overall quality of the final product.

This applies not only to brainstorming as I mentioned earlier, but also to the ability to give and receive technical feedback, which I found to be incredibly valuable.

Hopefully the interviews we had throughout the last couple of months gave everyone a glimpse into the tournament's inner workings. None of this would've been possible without the [team](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K#organisation) that arranged the tournament, the [players](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K#participants) who gave their all, and you — the community who supported both throughout the tournament!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-03-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-concludes/mwc7k2025-credits.png?1)

We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in making this possible, and as much as it pains us to say it, we'll have to tune out until next year! Nevertheless, the World Cups will go on. The osu!taiko World Cup 2025 is right around the corner, so make sure to keep an eye out for it!

But in case we don't see you... Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! Or something like that.
