These were the combatants for the greatest prize osu! has to offer: the World Cup. The game's grandest stage was set; all that was left was the battle of these teams' lives.

For the last time this year, [D I O](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619)'s video is available for those seeking a more visual recap!

The last pool of this year's OWC was 90% custom. There were only two existing maps present, both on DT: [Wonder Stella](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361790#osu/794750) provided the high-end fast aim in the DT pool, while [BIRTH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/175241#osu/422762) stood in for a more rounded map with a big stamina requirement on the second half.

Every other map was made specifically for this pool. Just mentioning the ones contested in every match, we first have two freemod picks in [Mmmmmmm](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475283#osu/5426056) and [Night of Knights](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475212#osu/5425907), both denser, aim-centric picks, with the latter also serving as a precision or low AR pick depending on the chosen mods. [R.I.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475339#osu/5426162) and [Guilty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475358#osu/5426197) were both popular mechanically intensive alt picks on HD and HR respectively, while [Shitodo Seiten Daimeiwaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475153#osu/5425751) was quite the opposite, serving as a low AR Hidden that was banned in all of this week's matches. Finally, the technical, precision HR pick of [EMBRYOGLYPH](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475349#osu/5426187) was also hotly contested.

As for maps we didn't end up seeing, [DIVINE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2474841#osu/5424868) was a primarily basic HR aim map that didn't see any picks or bans, which can also be said for [Kick To The Sky](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475377#osu/5426252), a map self-proclaimed to be more on the "clip-farm" side, with its difficulty more concentrated on specific sections.

As the last pool of the tournament, the plethora of [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) is something of a given. Three brand-new songs debuted in the pool this week, which we'll tackle in showcase order:

</div>

The great [Cansol](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/407) started the proceedings this week with their signature jazzy sound, giving us the frantic, yet still cool [Out of Place](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475329#osu/5426137), turned into a rhythmically active, challenging alt and flow aim map by [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929), [bob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5346261), and [oatmilk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16516525). With amazing storyboarding and graphics by the design team (all credited in the description), this original would not feel "out of place" in your favorites list!

Following that up, the illustrious [BlackY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/150) provided us with a fittingly intense, chilling track in [PANAGIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475347#osu/5426182). The Chinese duo of [yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1243669) and [Callionet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3072921) were put in charge of mapping it, making one of the toughest Hidden challenges in OWC history. This map also has a storyboard you'll surely want to check out, plus a set linked in the description with a full spread for whatever difficulty range you might prefer playing, so do give it a try!

Inevitably, we come to the Grand Finals tiebreaker. Created as a collab between five of the game's most prolific metal mappers, with a storyboard done by five of the best storyboarders out there. Design QA and illustrators far too numerous to recite reasonably. Drumroll mentally as you read this: presenting the greatly anticipated OWC tiebreaker, the capstone of the tournament, the reveal that morphs the osu! community into a pseudo-otaku TMZ, [right here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475379#osu/5426254).

A band known by all those familiar with osu!, the OWC 2025 Grand Finals tiebreaker artist is none other than the legendary [Imperial Circus Dead Decadence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35), with their almost 8-minute epic, [Yuuaku no Inori - Anima immortalis est. -](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475379#osu/5426254), a mixture of bone-chilling, fast and ferocious metal fused with frisson-inducing, epic vocals, be they at higher or lower tempos. Truly, a finale worth the wait.

## Grand Finals recap

Tournament immortality was at stake for ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961), already decorated veterans of the game's most competitive community tournaments and widely considered the two greatest tournament players of all time — both missing the final piece of the puzzle as the World Cup continued to remain an elusive final goal. Meanwhile, the United States sought to continue the lineage of the greatest dynasty the osu! World Cup has ever seen: 10 straight top-2 finishes and counting; 8 championships and counting — but their grasp on the title had grown more and more tenuous over the preceding iterations of the tournament, finally culminating in their being dethroned at the hands of South Korea in 2024.

As Poland looked on from their comfortable seat in the winners' side of the Grand Finals matchup, Australia and the United States got underway in the losers' bracket final. Discourse surrounding the matchup settled on a familiar consensus: if ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) could play at the astonishing levels he is capable of, Australia would have a reasonable chance at finally defeating an opponent they were thus far winless against in OWC history; if not, the United States' roster depth would more likely than not claim their sixth straight win against their foes from Down Under, earning their rematch against Poland.

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia

[**View the match information here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/120062857)

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2642591487&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

The early stages of the match saw ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) on the match of his life. The world #1 came out guns blazing, top-scoring Australia's first pick of [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475209#osu/5425903), putting up a ludicrous 764,565 to win a break point on the United States' first choice on the flow tapping control [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475347#osu/5426182), then somehow rising to even higher levels as he scored an S-rank 759,825 on the tech [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475370#osu/5426228) pick to take Australia to a fast 3–0 consolidated break point lead. It was a blistering flurry of scores worthy of the greatest player to ever touch the game, making it clear the U.S. would have their work cut out for them in this match.

While the ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) barrage continued unabated as he eventually top scored an astounding seven maps in a row, the United States eased into the match, which settled into a rhythm of teams winning their own picks. The U.S. won on back-to-back HR maps with their next two picks, aided by strong team-wide performance on the fast snap aim [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475358#osu/5426197) and the slider tech [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475349#osu/5426187); Australia, meanwhile, opted into more mechanics-forward maps, winning the high AR aim [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361790#osu/794750) and [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475339#osu/5426162) selections. Freemod hero ::{ flag=US }:: [BoshyMan741](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4830687) came into the lobby for the U.S. and helped them take a massive 521,093 win on the anti-mod [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475212#osu/5425907) before ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) took the lobby by storm on Australia's [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475322#osu/5426127) pick, full comboing it to move the scoreline to 6–3: match points for the last 3 picks of the match with the United States' dynasty on the precipice.

In dire straits now, the United States stayed in the freemod pool for their 5th pick of the match, choosing the dense consistency [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475283#osu/5426056) next. Back and forth the momentum swung throughout the entire 4-minute-plus duration of the map; combo fell time after time across the lobby in the waning moments, with neither team able to establish a meaningful lead. At long last, the dust settled on the lobby with the U.S. emerging victorious by just 15,244 points.

6–4 read the score: each team now had one pick remaining, with Australia clinging to a single match point on a map of their choosing. The highly volatile [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/175241#osu/422762) pick was their selection. Unfortunately for the Aussies, it would backfire on them in rapid fashion. They fell behind early, and when none of their players were able to hold a combo through the massive deathstream that was the key feature of this pick, the United States' break point was solidified. It would be their pick to try to send the match to a tiebreaker.

The final pick of the match was [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475329#osu/5426137), a highly challenging rhythm and aim control alt pick of an [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) track. Momentum from the past two maps on their side, the United States established a small lead, but once more the scoreline went back and forth, with no major advantage gained until finally, late in the match, a round of breaks from Australia while ::{ flag=US }:: [decaten](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5645231) and ::{ flag=US }:: [rektygon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7813296) held created a gap between the teams. By the final margin of 136,855, the United States forced the tiebreaker.

In the days leading up to the match, the reigning analysis was that it seemed Australia must only win 6 maps to have a better than even chance of winning the losers' bracket final — such was the belief in their roster's ability on the [tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475379#osu/5426254) with mechanically dominant players including ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902), ::{ flag=AU }:: [aknzx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9938943), and ::{ flag=AU }:: [ASecretBox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7341183) on the roster. As the long-awaited climax of the match finally got under way, though, the seemingly common knowledge was flipped on its head: ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) and ::{ flag=AU }:: [ASecretBox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7341183) both suffered uncharacteristic struggles, with ::{ flag=AU }:: [aknzx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9938943) and ::{ flag=AU }:: [cloppit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19851850/) left to contest the United States while the team's main carry duo attempted to regain their composure.

Throughout the map's-eight minute duration, the United States kept their noses out in front, with combo leads taking turns between all four players. Though the lead was never a massive one, rarely cresting the 100,000 point margin, it always remained steady on the American side. Despite the best efforts of the Australian squad in the final seconds of the map to bring the score back their way, it was simply not meant to be. The United States held on by 87,464. They had completed a remarkable comeback: from 6–3 down, they won four straight points including the tiebreaker to win the match and claim a guaranteed top 2 finish, sending Australia home in a heartbreaking third place.

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

[**View the match information here (set 1)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/120078133) and [**here (set 2)**!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/120078716)

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2644048589&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

While the Aussies saw in front of them 12 months of contemplation, of trying to come to grips with their collapse and planning for the next World Cup, the United States had a familiar foe in their headlights: Poland, who had beaten them 7–6 in the winners' bracket Finals a week before and who were one of only two teams to have ever defeated them in a Grand Final.

Poland entered the 2025 World Cup as co-favorites for good reason. They possessed possibly the greatest tournament player of all time in captain ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961), and this year's roster was possibly the best one they had ever assembled, with all the pieces in place to finally capture their second OWC victory. By beating the United States, they had shown they were capable of doing just that, and with bracket reset advantage in hand they entered the Grand Final as the tentative favorites.

The United States, though, hadn't come this far for nothing. "Spectacular" might be the best word to describe their performance to start off the first set of the match. Withstanding a ridiculous [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475339#osu/5426162) double FC from ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [milosz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13108233), the U.S. were otherwise perfect as they trounced Poland on map after map. All the small margins that had seemingly gone against the U.S. went in their favor in this match, with scorelines including a 39,434 point win on the opening [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475283#osu/5426056) for a break point and a 10,408 victory on [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475212#osu/5425907) that gave them a 4–1 double break point advantage. It was all U.S. all the time en route to a shocking 7–1 victory, setting up the bracket reset.

Questions swirled between the sets as the players took an intermission. What had gone so wrong for Poland in the first set? Was it their pick and ban strategy, or did they simply not have it on the worst day possible to underperform? How had the United States come out on this level? Was this type of performance sustainable for the American roster?

---

Strategic inquiries were answered quickly in the second set. Each team adjusted their bans, with the United States dropping their [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361790#osu/794750) ban, opting to leave it up in favor of removing [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475339#osu/5426162) from the pool; Poland meanwhile chose to ban [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475323#osu/5426129) after being soundly beaten on it in set 1, allowing [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475349#osu/5426187) through the ban phase this time.

Poland wasted no time putting their new option to good use, first picking [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/361790#osu/794750) with ::{ flag=PL }:: [milosz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13108233) putting up an outrageous 1-miss 827,613 score that proved to be only barely enough for the win, as the U.S. pulled the score gap back in the closing seconds with Poland eking out the point by just 29,338. After losing seemingly every close point in set 1, Poland finally won one such map: was this a portent of things to come?

After trading the next two picks, including Poland's fortunes flipping by winning [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475283#osu/5426056) after dropping it in the opener, they finally took their first break point of the Grand Final on the fast snap alt [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475358#osu/5426197) pick. Though the U.S. had won the map in the first set, they were unable to do the same again as ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) scored an incredible 915,488 to top the lobby by over 400,000 and ensure victory. Next, they consolidated the break point on [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475209#osu/5425903) for a 4–1 lead.

The United States took advantage of the slider tech [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475349#osu/5426187) being open for them by winning it for their next point, but their collective back was well and truly broken on Poland's next pick. Opting into yet another map they had dropped in set 1, Poland selected [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475212#osu/5425907), and what came next was an astonishing carry from an unheralded source: ::{ flag=PL }:: [Kosiarek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9086565) came in as one of their nomod players and proceeded to put up the score of the weekend with a 787,951 1-miss play. The lead was out to 5–2, but what felt more important was that the United States had now lost three of those points on maps they had won in the first set. Momentum was entirely in Poland's favor, now just two points away from the title.

After a straightforward U.S. victory on [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475370#osu/5426228) brought the score to 5–3, Poland dropped the hammer on [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2475336#osu/5426154), winning the snap-aim reading map by nearly 400k. As with the losers' bracket final, the scoreline read 6–3 with the United States next to pick, desperately trying to survive. Unlike the losers' bracket final, there was no salvation in their future.

[DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/175241#osu/422762) would be the site: it had heralded the one and only break point won by the U.S. in their comeback in their previous match and had been a winning pick for them in the first set of the Grand Final. This time, though, tragedy struck as multiple members of their tapping roster struggled through the lengthy stream midway through the map. Poland took full advantage, hammering down the final nail in the coffin to close the match out for a 7–3 win. Despite the best efforts of the American roster, Poland was simply too strong at the end of the day, claiming their ultimate prize as osu! World Cup 2025 champions.

Many in the community know [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) for her contributions as the mappooler and advisor for MWC 4K, where she has helped shape the competitive side of World Cups. This year, she also played a key role in the production of osu! originals by taking on the responsibility of translating Japanese lyrics into English. Her involvement this year includes [Veil of Ash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8kmvlpSj4) from CWC Quarterfinals tiebreaker, [Hexen Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aiV-u_bMf4) from OWC Semifinals tiebreaker, and of course, OWC Grand Finals tiebreaker [Yuuaku no Inori - Anima immortalis est. -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5b9JtprsV8). For anyone who's interested in taking a closer look at these fully singable English lyrics, the translation of all three songs can [be found in this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BXGf97ivzVmNf_OowDBDFEh9MiT1bOno7eyvf60naCQ).

Hi mint! I'm glad we also had the opportunity to collaborate outside MWC 4K. For anyone who isn't familiar with your work, could you introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your background?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576">-mint-</a></p>

Hello! My name is mint. I am an osu!mania 4K mapper and player, and I have been involved with MWC 4K's mappools since 2019. You can read more about that in my [previous interview](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-concludes). Most people will know me for maps like [Parallel Universe Shifter](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062263#mania/4312004), [LIGHT LEFT BEHIND](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062241#mania/4311938), and [Saishuu Kichiku Imouto Flandre-S (Camellia Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2342737#mania/5058169), but there is so much more that I am involved in behind the scenes, especially in the osu! World Cups as a whole, that doesn't manifest on the surface.

I became an osu!mania 4K Advisor to the World Cups in 2023 when the role was created, which subsequently resulted in my increased involvement in and oversight into the process of osu! originals. I also communicate directly with the musicians we commission for MWC 4K regarding items such as song direction. In that sense, I've been gaining a lot of experience interfacing with musicians on a fairly professional level.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

You've handled all lyric translations for osu! originals this year, working closely with musicians and the design team. What led you to take on lyric translation for World Cups?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576">-mint-</a></p>

A few things actually ended up lining up fairly well for me to land this particular gig. For one, I have taken the equivalent of two years of Japanese in my undergrad, partly to communicate more directly with some of our musicians who are not as comfortable with using English. On top of that, osu! had been commissioning more and more originals with Japanese vocals, which left the door open for lyrics translations. In particular, [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) and [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) started heavily pushing the idea that we should be making singable English lyrics for these songs, mostly for sing-along accessibility purposes.

After doing the lyrics translations for Kabocha and Aitsuki Nakuru's [Dear The Night I Loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja7NkYv2Oco) from [MWC 4K 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K), then seeing mango and Sakura working on English lyrics for Imy's [Lies playing Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ZaTeibemI) for [OWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024), I expressed my interest in doing English lyrics for upcoming songs, and so volunteered for Symholic's [Veil of Ash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8kmvlpSj4) from [CWC 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025), alongside [Himada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10959366).

Since my Japanese comprehension is still at an intermediate level, Himada carried for a lot of the actual translating, and I was more in charge of the lyric fitting. I think we did pretty well considering it was my first real attempt at something like this. For [Hexen Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aiV-u_bMf4) and [Yuuaku no Inori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5b9JtprsV8), I ended up having to solo, which made it extremely difficult. In fact, a fair bit of Yuuaku's English lyrics had to go through a couple rounds of revisions while communicating with the lyricist, Rib:y(uhki). However, all of that ended up paying off and I feel extremely satisfied with the work that I did for OWC 2025. Both sets of lyrics are very powerful, and they mean a lot to me, so I hope people can enjoy singing along with them.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

Watching your translation process made me realise how often we face trade-offs. Finding a good balance between literal accuracy and how the words feel when sung can be extremely difficult. How do you decide when to prioritise meaning, sound, and emotional impact?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576">-mint-</a></p>

I listen to quite a handful of Japanese artists and bands, my absolute favorites being Lamp, [Kikuo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/314), youまん, and ZUTOMAYO. I think that this level of exposure has allowed me to get an intuitive feel for how Japanese lyrics function rhythmically, which is notably somewhat more rigid than English. This is a pretty important concept to keep in mind for writing English lyrics, since the preservation of rhythm can also mean sacrificing flow. You will notice that for a lot of the scream sections in Yuuaku no Inori, the exact syllable count does not actually line up perfectly, but the English lines are still singable (screamable?) while maintaining fidelity to the contour of the original Japanese lines.

English is also really weird because it has natural emphasis (both on a macro and micro level) built into every single word and phrase. For example, if you take the word "believe", there is a natural vowel reduction on the "be" syllable, while the "lieve" syllable is emphasised. These sorts of things are second nature to native English speakers, but even then it rarely crosses people's minds unless you actually have to think about it. And that's just a micro level example; macro level examples would involve full phrases or sentences. All of this is required to be able to fit an English line into the original rhythm from the Japanese line.

A lot of exact meanings have to be sacrificed for these reasons, since adhering too much to the direct translations will hinder the lyrics' flow. Nerissa Ravencroft has a [good example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7doDnHRGn_Y) explaining this. Most of the time, there will be more syllables than you may feel like you need to be able to convey the same meaning, so you are pretty much forced to improvise anyways.

Take [the second chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5b9JtprsV8&t=322s) of Yuuaku no Inori, for example. The literal translation of these lines are: "This song we sing, proof that I lived / Is a prayer of black and white / Let it be your light". We're already fairly lucky with the white/light rhyme, so I started building it out from there. The exact meanings are not identical, but the emotion that it conveys is close to the same.

> *"When I am gone, this melody we sing carries on in the light*
>
> *A prayer in black and white*
>
> *It will glisten for you in the night"*

Speaking of rhymes, there is the [ending section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aiV-u_bMf4&t=272s) of Hexen Noir. I was really proud of these lines:

> *"Shooting stars fly beyond my vision*
>
> *Yet their tails are just an illusion*
>
> ...
>
> *In this world that's devoid of color*
>
> *Oh I wish you'd still hear my holler"*

They are actually pretty close to the original meaning, but I wanted to focus here on the rhymes because of the way these phrases were constructed, with a sort of call-and-response idea along with the rhythms of each line being basically identical. I felt that it was imperative that these lines had some sort of rhyme scheme, because of these kinds of intrinsic connections between the lines. Otherwise, in the choruses for example, there was not really any need for rhyming since each line felt like its own entity.

Both of these songs are also littered with metaphors and imagery, which were very important to adhere to. For the most part, this was not too difficult, but on occasion, it was necessary to add my own twist on these due to constraints as mentioned prior. One example is the line [right before the second chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aiV-u_bMf4&t=197s) of Hexen Noir, "ただ燃える命を　君へと　捧ぐだけ". I felt that the translation for this would end up somewhat clunky if sung in English, so I decided to continue the mirror metaphor from the lines before it, with the line:

> *"Broken glass that scatters everywhere, I pick them up piece by piece for you"*

indicating that the mirror was shattered due to the inescapable nightmare that it brought.

Overall, there are so many tiny decisions like these that truly brought these lyrics to life, and I'm really happy with how they turned out. Over the coming years, I intend to continue striving to perfect my craft, and write even better lyrics, not just for osu! originals, but perhaps my own upcoming projects as well.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

Indeed, your translations went beyond preserving meaning. You also made sure the English lyrics were singable, having them match the rhythm and syllable count of the original Japanese lyrics. What were your main inspirations when you did translations?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576">-mint-</a></p>

To be honest, for the longest time, I did not have much exposure to English lyrics outside of pop songs I'd hear simply via cultural osmosis. My biggest inspiration for English lyric writing would absolutely have to be [Jamie Paige](https://www.youtube.com/@JamiePaigeIRL). I only started getting into her music about half a year ago, but a lot of her lyrics have really stuck with me. [Porter Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/@porterrobinson) has also been a pretty sizable influence for me in that regard.

One weird source of inspiration for me has been [Northernlion](https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion). He is a Twitch streamer who often comes up with (usually questionable) parody lyrics on the fly, to the point where I have found myself doing the same on occasion. It's really fun to do, though I fear my friends have started to find it annoying.

Overall though, I think I'm still largely influenced by the Japanese vocal music that I listen to, including the artists I mentioned earlier. The songs that I worked on lyrics for this year are all very inspirational and amazing to listen to (even though I'm personally not huge on metal, and the three songs I worked on all happened to be, I still really enjoy them!) so I would highly recommend checking them out if you haven't done so already.

If anyone is a jack of all trades on the World Cup design team, it's Iyouka. Over the past two years, Iyouka has taken on every creative role across osu! original designs. He has worked on illustration, graphic design, storyboarding, and is mostly known for his visual effects work on video showcases. His contributions span over a dozen World Cup projects, including the Grand Finals tiebreaker [Yuuaku no Inori - Anima immortalis est. -](https://youtu.be/d5b9JtprsV8).

Welcome! I'm really glad we were able to push through this year and finally sit down for this interview. Before we dive in, could you introduce yourself and share a bit about your design experience?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Iyouka.jpg')"></a>

Heyo, Iyouka here, just a hobbyist visual designer from Malaysia. I mostly play standard, but I also casually play taiko and mania 4K. I started doing graphic design casually all the way back in 2015 and have continued ever since. One of my early designs for the community was for [osu! Malaysia Tournament 2019](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/903413?n=1), and since then I've been designing for various osu! tournaments and communities such as JOKE (Jaye's One Key Event), GTS (Global Taiko Showdown), Resurrection Cup, and Project Prism 2024.

I started my design journey with Photoshop. It was fun and all until I began to feel a sense of bottleneck, since the designs I made were always static images. That was the main reason I decided to learn After Effects and Blender to start making videos, specifically motion graphics, so I could create more animated and dynamic designs. How I got into storyboarding is quite an interesting story, but long story short, the [osu! Malaysia Tournament 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1764716?n=1) [Grand Finals tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2028305#osu/4226605) didn't have a storyboarder, so I volunteered to do it with the help of a quick storyboarding crash course from [Jerry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605973). Illustration-wise, I started because I was heavily inspired by [PewDiePie's 100 days drawing challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJDtQTTAogk).

I joined the osu! World Cup Design Team in early 2024 and have worked on multiple projects since then. Going into all of them here would get super long and boring so feel free to check out my [portfolio site](https://iyouka.carrd.co/) to see all of my visual creations from the beginning of my design career up until now.

You've worked as an illustrator, graphic designer, storyboarder, and also vfx designer. How do you juggle between so many roles? While having a good understanding of all aspects of design production, does your thought process change when you're focused on a single task compared to handling a variety of design roles?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Iyouka.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499">Iyouka</a></p>

I rarely had the chance (or dared) to do solo designs in any of the World Cup projects until [Locus 2025](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025) was announced. It was a contest that required each team to produce an original song, a full beatmap spread, and also designs to accompany the song. The production period being long enough makes it a perfect opportunity for me to stress test myself on juggling all designer roles in [a single project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjntf6P2ANg).

My weakness is actually making designs without any assets to use. Usually when I'm in a project as a GFX or VFX designer, my designs will revolve around the illustration assets. So without any illustrations to work with, I was guaranteed to struggle and would need more time to produce illustration assets that can support pure graphic design and storyboarding.

The most challenging moment when working on the Locus project was during the early phases. Since I was the only designer on the team, I had to come up with the ideas, the theme, what kind of illustration I wanted to draw, what kind of GFX I needed to design, and what kind of storyboard I wanted to make. To make things more challenging, this was an anonymous contest, so I couldn't consult other designer friends to get feedback. It was all on me.

After multiple discussions with our musician [takehirotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/428), we settled on a chess theme that could link both the music and visuals together. I would say the design flow for my Locus project was quite straightforward, following this order: setting the theme, producing illustration assets, finishing graphic design, storyboarding, doing self quality checks, and then getting final approval from the team. I'm confident to say the main reason I am able to juggle between so many roles during Locus was by sacrificing most of my sleep, especially with deadlines to meet while also working on other design projects at the same time.

That said, being the visual director of my own project did have its advantages. Unlike a typical design project, I knew exactly what the graphic designer needed, what the storyboarder needed, how much time each task would need, whether the illustration required layer separation, how large the canvas size should be, and so on — all because, well, everyone involved in design was the same person. Even so, I'd personally still prefer working with multiple designers so tasks can be done in parallel, but as I mentioned earlier, this project was also a way for me to benchmark myself.

Thanks to the knowledge and experience I gained from working on multiple World Cup projects, I was able to enhance the overall design of [Haiboku no Altra Vita](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2412331#osu/5297696) and managed to win first place in the visual category and second place overall at Locus this year. One of the things I learned from this experience is that having multiple skill sets can indeed improve your designs. However, the most important part is how all these skills are used to form a single piece of beautiful harmony, rather than just gluing assets together to call it a day and hope it will enhance the visual. While wishful thinking might work in some cases, it often takes extra touch-ups to truly make everything shine.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

We collaborated on so many projects over the years, especially visual effects videos. At this point, both of us already have a very clear collaboration procedure to align our perspectives, divide responsibilities, and to build on each other's work by sharing assets and refining ideas together. I think this is a good opportunity to recap how we brought everything together in the [Yuuaku no Inori - Anima immortalis est. -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5b9JtprsV8) video.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Iyouka.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499">Iyouka</a></p>

Yes, both of us have collaborated on many videos, both within and outside the World Cup scene. I would say that it's always a fun experience working with you, since we're usually in voice calls together with the team whenever we're making a video. It's nice to have someone working alongside you to build things piece by piece.

The [Yuuaku no Inori - Anima immortalis est. -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5b9JtprsV8) video was definitely one of the most challenging projects for everyone involved, including the two of us. With a very limited timeframe, on top of being borderline burnt out from previous projects and dealing with the song's demanding theme, it wasn't an easy production by any means. Still, we managed to successfully pull through and achieved good results. I'll walk through how our video collaboration usually works. The overall process is similar across World Cups, so this should also give viewers a clear idea of how we operate beyond the visible design output of osu! originals.

First things first, Sakura usually holds a planning meeting in the design team server with everyone involved in the project. This includes illustrators, graphic designers, storyboarders, and also visual effects designers. During the planning meeting, we all focus on translating the song into what design assets to produce. As for the video, the first step is deciding where the video ends and where the storyboard begins, with the video usually covering the opening part of the song. From there, we split the song timeline into sections and break those sections down further into individual shots. This is also the fun part of the meeting because we all join the voice call to go through a lot of reference videos to build a direction for how each shot should look and feel, and we roughly piece those ideas together to guide our execution. At the same time, we invite illustrators into the discussion to request illustration assets, layer separation, and feedback when needed. The planning phase gets wrapped up by assigning each section of the video to whoever is best suited for it. Sakura is very experienced with Live2D style character animation and scene compositing, while I'm more skilled in lyrics composition and keyframe engineering. Overall, this workflow is fairly similar across other designer roles as well. Once you understand the work division process, it's easy to see how illustrators, graphic designers, and storyboarders all fit into the same workflow.

Honestly, there isn't much to break down when it comes to execution, since the two of us have worked together so many times we already knew how to approach our individual shots. That familiarity just magically made our collaboration fast and smooth. What happened behind the scenes was just constant back and forth communication between me and Sakura where we exchanged VFX assets and gave each other feedback so each of our shots could be refined further. Considering how limited the production time was, I think we can both agree that we're satisfied with how the video eventually turned out. Once again, a huge shoutout to everyone who worked on this Grand Finals tiebreaker to make it happen.

After everything we've worked on this year, what part of these projects did you find the most satisfying? Looking ahead, are there any ideas and skills you hope to explore in future designs?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Iyouka.jpg')"></a>

The most satisfying part for me this year was being able to work on projects that combined strong music, high quality visual assets, and good teamwork. Another good example of that was the [CWC 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025) Quarterfinals tiebreaker [Veil of Ash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391791#fruits/5177767) by [Symholic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/130) feat. [Rina Komatsu](https://www.youtube.com/@RinaKomatsu). I'm a big fan of Symholic, so having the chance to create a video for their music was already very rewarding on its own. This project also came after Locus was announced, which made me much more comfortable handling the video work on my own. On top of that, the illustrations by [-pineapple-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326), [Alptraum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26496648), and [Hecatia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8244635), the graphic design by [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799), the storyboard by [LowGraphics](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942), and the lyric translations by [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) and [Himada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10959366) all made the entire process even more enjoyable. Working with the high quality assets they provided gave me a lot of room to push [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8kmvlpSj4) further, and the teamwork on this project was beyond outstanding.

By the end of this year, I've achieved many things that I never thought would be possible just by imagining them. Soloing Locus 2025 and placing in the top five, working on the osu! World Cup 2025 Grand Finals tiebreaker, securing a full-time job, and more have all been huge milestones for me. Looking ahead, I might slow down a bit in terms of overall design work, as I'm feeling quite burnt out at the time of writing. I will still continue designing, just not at the same pace in 2025 I would say. One thing I'm sure about is that I want to become more active in making illustrations again next year. It's something I really enjoy, but I haven't been able to fully commit to it lately due to design commissions and various ongoing projects. My illustration skills still have a lot of room to grow, but I'm hoping I can improve and produce something that will catch everyone's attention. Stay tuned.
