Rhythm game music is **Drazically**'s bread and butter.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/496/header.jpg)

Pure hype paired with rhythmic complexity is the makeup of each of **Drazically**'s electronic tunes, constantly pushing towards a goal of the perfect music for rhythm games. osu! is here for that journey, which is why **Drazically** is officially part of our Featured Artists!

**13** songs are part of [**Drazically**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/496), each of which comes with a `.osz` that's pre-timed (timed in advance by us) and post-mapped (soon-to-be-mapped by you).

Music doesn't need words to explain it. Use your ears:

### [Drazically - Reality:SHIFT](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/496/Songs/Drazically%20-%20RealitySHIFT%20(feat.%20Hatsune%20Miku).osz)

A special build of osu!(lazer) found its way into [COE 2025](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event)'s arcade area. [arbiter of soup](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12232503) and [Chupalika](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1926383) showed it off with [-Kazuha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29978316)'s map of [Reality:SHIFT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2335282)!

...Maybe next year we'll see osu!catch in the arcade so [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2362316) by [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636) can have its time in the limelight.

[**Drazically**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/496) is where you'll find every song above, plus a bunch more. All of them are worth mapping, so if you choose to listen to them, we hope you have the availability to map all of them too.

Next weekend? Another Featured Artist announcement. Stay tuned.
