Project Loved is back to bring some respite from the cold november winds!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

If you're new to osu!, or got hit too hard by a wind gust, here's what we do: Project Loved hosts community voting polls every month to decide on beatmaps to be added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps chosen are lovingly selected by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes from community suggestions. Each beatmap banner in this news post will direct you to the respective poll and the handcrafted description from a captain. Alternatively, you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for **10 days**, so don't forget to vote before it's too late! More information can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

As always, thanks for voting in the last round, one way or the other! Find the results here:

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The *Popular Playcount* for this month is [Seamob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10840806)'s now iconic multi-song mapset, [Multiple Artists - thing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1599852#osu/3267589).

If you've asked anyone in recent years, "What are some good tapping maps I can use to improve?" they've likely sent you this map over. It features three songs: *Infected Mushroom - The Pretender*, *xi - Garyou Tensei*, and *Metrik - We Got It (feat. Rothwell)*. It also has different BPM difficulties: 235, 250, 270, 285, and 300. If you feel like it's missing lower-BPM difficulties, no worries, because the HT mod will be your best friend.

This map is a true burst control/light stability test. It has plenty of 8-note, 16-note, and even some 20+ note streams to test your streaming abilities. This mapset garnering over 290,000+ plays and 100+ favorites shows me it would slot in perfectly for Project Loved.

If you want this to enter a Loved state, go ahead and give it your vote!

Coming in with the Popular Playcount pick, we got a [Kumo No Kireme](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/825710#osu) hosted by [Lusumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7575461).

It's not the same one Vaxei played 6 years ago by the way, this one is known for having been made for Corsace Open 2018.

It's just a very high BPM aim set, fitting for all demographics due to its complete spread from 2.65★ to 7.99★ in difficulty.

Over 100,000 people played this set, I hope a lot of you are happy to see this have the chance of getting a proper leaderboard now!!

Another high BPM / alt map coming up!!

This month's Outstanding Oldies includes [Uchouten Vivace](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/645329#osu), an old map made by [cRyo\[iceeicee\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/835998).

This map contains very geometrical / symmetrical alt patterns and a mix of high spacing jumps every now and then. It feels very comfortable to play, YET challenging on some specific sections.

Do not be fooled by the difficulty name, this is obviously far from an actual Insane.

A -TRUE TRIAL- ENTERS THE ARENA FOR THIS MONTH'S *DAREDEVIL DIFFICULTIES*...

[Azrulk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046612) makes his long-awaited debut in the Loved section with his signature slidertech in [KO3 & Reflect - Ritual of Anubis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1987765#osu/4129148). This map pushes the limits of aim control and slider tracing, a real *tribulation* if you catch my drift. Three minutes of relentless 8★ slidertech sets a high bar for entry, and by now, [Azrulk's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046612) name is synonymous with breaking the boundaries of tech mapping.

HEY MALISZEWSKI... NOBODY IS FORGETTING ABOUT THAT CORSACE CLOSED SCORE.... I HOPE YOU TAKE YOUR RIGHTFUL #1 ON THIS MAP, AND I HOPE THE REST OF YOU VOTE YES!

Although sitting at an already tough 7.22★, this map is EVEN harder than it seems, featuring crazy patterns that require high-level finger control, reading, and aim control.

Make sure to give this map your YES vote this month in its polls, especially if you think you've got what it takes to compete on its leaderboard!

I'd like to dedicate this pick to our recent Project Loved alumni [FrosIass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048), Blue Dragon or Mismagius, the one who started it all back in 2011 with [Can't Defeat Airman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/24313#osu/104229). Thank you so much for your years of service to this game, and your three years of captainship in Loved! <3

Please wish them well on their future endeavors, and of course, please remember to drop a YES if you enjoyed this trip down memory lane.

You could call me John Shun-ran with how much I love this map... It's easy to see why though, as this beatmap provides an accessible yet unique take on alt-mapping, featuring a lot of snappy and fast gameplay that also tricks up your reading, backed with a catchy track and vocals from Hatsune Miku. Shoutout to all the alt players of osu! This one's for you!

The last *Wildcard* pick of this month is [EON BREAK](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/977125#osu), hosted by [Atlust](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4086593) (formerly known as Necho) this map is outstanding in every aspect, both in its playability and in its mapping.

Created in 2019 for the osu! Mapping Olympiad contest, this mapset contains guest difficulties from a few participants that made it into the top 3, making for variety in the mapping from each of them. From an alt map, to a stamina practice map, to a circle only difficulty!

Appreciated from a majority of mappers and players, I think this map is worth bringing up to Loved! Vote yes!!!!

From the mind of [Sayira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7253958) comes [KryptoDigital - Fallen Theory](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1754808#taiko), a map that perfectly captures her signature chaotic, but fun gimmicks!

Known for her clever uses of barline gimmicks, slider shenanigans, and all sorts of other gimmicky surprises, [Sayira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7253958) crafts an experience that keeps intermediate osu!taiko drummers on their toes while never losing its sense of fun.

Originally featured as [Intermediate Global Taiko Showdown 2022](https://gtsosu.com/igts/home) Grand Finals No Mod 4, this map tested players' focus and memorization in one of the most suitable finale maps possible. Though [Sayira](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7253958) has been rather quiet in recent times, her work continues to be remembered even today.

If you're into playful maps that break the norm and challenge your reading in all the best ways, go give Fallen Theory a spin, and don't forget to hit "Yes!" if you want to see it Loved!

From 1/6 newbies to dump mapping veterans, it's safe to say that anyone who's familiar with tech maps knows about [nananass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7231722) and his unique mapping style.

If you enjoy over the top stamina-draining bursts and mind-twisting snapping changes, you should absolutely check [Yasui Yousuke - YO-KAI Disco Speed Up Ver](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/549794#taiko/1164174), a deathstream map packed with 1/6 and 1/8 on top of nass' characteristic roll-focused color changes.

If you're looking for a REAL nass experience, this is the perfect map for you.

Why are you still here? Go play it, but, most importantly vote "Yes!" if you want to see the map Loved!

[Hana Hayashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4601806)'s mapset of [Over The Fullereneshift](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1102340#taiko), renowned for its unique stream maps, is an exceptionally challenging mapset that pushes players to their limits, including the diff used in the [TWC 2020](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2020) Grand Finals.

The top diff is a stream map of 1/4 + 1/6, but its most distinctive feature is undoubtedly the unique color scheme for the notes, especially the final kiai long stream — the color scheme alone is challenging, yet 1/6 notes flow in mixed together. It undoubtedly ranks among the most difficult maps used in TWC.

I've played this map hundreds of times, but even top players struggle to maintain consistent performance. For all players dreaming of competing in the TWC, this is a challenge map I strongly urge you to play!

Also, take a look at [Jaltzu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2597417)'s [guest diff](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1102340#taiko/2308040). His mapping style is also very unique, featuring a rhythmic layout that invites mistakes...! (The flow of the SV is especially beautiful to watch, so please pay attention to that too! The volumes in this mapset are also all set by Jaltzu, nice work! ^^)

Even if you're not great at the top diff, you can enjoy Jaltzu's guest diff or practice with the nerfed top diff, THERMAL PRESSURE, making this mapset accessible to players somewhat familiar with it all the way up to top-tier players!!

Have fun!! <3

Do you like *streams*? Do you like *neverending streams*?? Do you like 'em ***FAST???*** Then you've come to the right place!

[Yurishurashushushu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1895770#taiko) is a classic stream-stamina map made by [KawaiiBass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11992585). This guy needs no introduction, he's renowned for his use of comfortable patterns and intuitive coloring, and this map is no exception!

After playing a bit of filler, prepare to be hit with an absolute onslaught of notes coming at a speed of 21.6 key presses per second, that's 324 BPM 1/4 streaming in osu! terms! Although, if you wanna go the extra mile and make your [fingers move like a spider](https://x.com/shinchikuhome/status/1624960653990699008), you should definitely try the 1.05x rate-up, which brings the total key presses per second to 22.67 *(don't say it...)*. However, streams are not everyone's cup of tea so if you ever feel like playing something a little less intense, but still speedy, make sure to give the x2 diff a try too.

I'll see you at the polls!

[frums - parvorbital](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1706274#taiko/3486429) by [\_Rise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5217107) is that type of map that screams for a leaderboard. This map sits at such a high star rating (while, dare I say, it's UNDERRATED) that only a select group of people are able to play it. However, this made [parvorbital](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1706274#taiko/3486429) very suited to tournaments, and made tournaments such a joy and excitement to watch (his map was picked as a [Grand Finals map during SGTS 2023](https://gtsosu.com/2023/sgts/pools)).

Being able to witness greatness and pure skill is not something that can only be seen once during tournaments, but can also be watched unfold on a leaderboard, and Project Loved is the perfect enabler. It falls into your hands to give the final verdict.

[rN - Hundred Voices and the Heartbroken Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2065444#taiko) features two of osu!taiko's best known mappers — [ZTH](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5258461) and [\_Rise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5217107). The chaotic nature of the song, combined with BPM changes and a speedy 356 BPM section in the middle, suits both mappers' styles well, culminating in an intense challenge for even the most experienced of players. So whether you're into the tech-focused 6.73★ difficulty, or the finger-breaking 8.88★ difficulty, do remember to vote yes!

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

[Nene Sakura](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701104/) is known for being a really good player, but they also mapped quite a lot. So far, they have three ranked mapsets and a good amount of graveyarded maps. However, no Loved mapsets yet, so this could potentially be their Loved debut!

[Uraomote Lovers](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1688031#fruits/3449861) is a very solid map. It features a lot of hyperdash-heavy patterns. If you can't keep up, you will potentially make a lot of consecutive misses. The map doesn't really require speed, but you need to be consistent with hyperchains. At HP3, the map is very forgiving, so players will likely not fail even when missing a lot. Good players shouldn't have too much trouble performing well on this map, and mod usage will be fairly common. I can see this being a good challenge for eager new players who aim to improve on such maps.

All in all, pretty fun to play. Make sure to give it a try and don't forget to vote!

*description written by [Realmaas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640)*

In the past couple of years, [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) started custom mapping for various tournaments, and showcased an amazing ability to adapt to many different styles, songs, and difficulties. Even though we're starting to see maps of his in pretty much every slot imaginable, none feel as right as his low approach rate control maps.

[CODE-COSTARICA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202815#fruits) was part of the [2024 CWC Grand Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024#grand-finals), as a control-heavy Double Time pick. With a style clearly inspired by some of the old classic converts, such as the [Kirby](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/28158#fruits/96684) [Mixes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/549969#fruits/1164568), this map offers a brutal challenge regardless of what mods you play it with. But with the many complex sliders, the irregular spacings and a high circle size, few players will even feel comfortable on the map without mods.

[ExGon's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) typical control-heavy style is pushed very far in this one, and it is both a pain and a pleasure to play. If you would like to see this map reach Loved status, please vote "Yes"!

And now for a change of pace to the tournament meta.

In the midst of autumn, [Four Seasons](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1767252#mania/3617507) is brought to you by Peruvian SV extraordinaire [Kamikho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12664851). I've mentioned instances of SV players turning into SV mappers before: yes, this is another one.

Clocking in at 220 BPM, *Four Seasons* is a bit more physical than your average, conventional SV. Also a fair bit more abrasive! As such, this may be a refreshing challenge for those who are looking for new ways to read notes... Well, everything old becomes new again at some point, right?

This file first existed on Etterna in [hi19hi19 Pack 4 - Modern Keyboardsmash](https://etternaonline.com/packs/3636), which is arguably one of the most well-known pack series on the site. Later reuploaded to osu! for [MWC 4K 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K)'s Round of 16 pool, it managed to show that the popularity truly did transfer across games.

The chart itself is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an "FFRcore"-esque chart, with lots of high BPM jumpstream, 260 BPM this time around, alongside even tighter bursts made to be very straining on your hands. That is to say, the song choice as well being a huge factor in why this is achievable.

With that said and done, it's likely everything stated here is something you're all too familiar with, so why not give it your vote?

234 – 280.8 BPM, 3:33 | 5.64★, 5.88★, 6.12★, 6.36★, 6.59★\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

We've already seen a few [Punnies](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8700468) charts in Loved and Ranked, and potentially adding to that collection would be [Sukisuki Zecchoushou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240519#mania/2579003)!

With the chart focusing on jumpstreams and handstreams, it's no surprise that this was played frequently, and with quite a few favourites as well. Jumpstreams and handstreams are some of the more popular patterns, and these are quintessential in order for you to improve a lot as a player, especially when you are still starting out. By this point though, you would have already been proficient enough to play around 230+ BPM, as at the base rate, you are greeted with this speed.

A length of 3 minutes and 33 seconds is certainly no joke, as this will definitely go the distance stamina-wise if you are not careful. The jumpstream/handstream patterns you see at the start only scratches the surface of how difficult it is, as it doesn't really showcase how difficult the chart gets as time passes on. Thankfully, you will get a lot of breaks, so you have some time to recover stamina. However, in these sections, you are forced to make no mistakes if you want to get a good score, as these break sections only contain a few notes in general.

The more you go into this chart, the denser it gets. It gets especially brutal when you get to the last jumpstream section, as this is where your stamina would have probably been reduced by a lot. It ends with a difficult stream pattern, potentially throwing you off if you are not careful enough.

[Sukisuki Zecchoushou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1240519#mania/2579003) is certainly a difficult chart for those unprepared, and with rates up to 1.2x (reaching up to 280 BPM), it would be crazy to see how players in today's level would keep up. That being said, if you want to see another [Punnies](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8700468) chart in Loved, OR want to support more charts like this in general, then I think you should definitely give it a shot and vote now!

[BEMANI Sound Team feat. Fernweh - Sakazuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1266971#mania) by [\[Crz\]Rachel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369409)\
126 – 182 BPM, 2:12 | 6.45★, 7.08★, 7.70★, 8.32★, 8.93★\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[\[Crz\]Rachel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8369409) is notorious for creating difficult charts, particularly in the chordjack skillset, and [Sakazuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1266971#mania/2633097) is no exception.

Right from the start, you can expect dense chordjack patterns featuring a mix of jumps, hands, and even quads. The thing is, you'll rarely get any breaks in this chart. Despite this song being only 2 minutes long at 1.0x, it manages to cram a huge amount of dense chordjack patterns into a short span of time, requiring proficiency in pattern recognition, stamina, speed, and overall mastery of the skillset. Being 140 BPM certainly doesn't help either, as a song this fast can give numerous players a lot of trouble throughout the chart.

If you think 1.0x is too easy, rates up to 1.3x are available. However, 0.9x also exists as a great way to train your chordjack reading and stamina.

It's no surprise that [Sakazuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1266971#mania/2633097) received so much attention, as I believe this chart perfectly encapsulates the essence of a challenging chordjack density map. If you think so too, consider voting in the thread and putting it to the test against the best players in the world!

[Thank You Scientist - Chromology](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1203542#mania) by [Davvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10047413)\
120 BPM, 9:41 | 4.49★\
*description written by [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093)*

Time for something much more... *unique*.

[Davvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10047413) used to be around for making charts of songs you'd rarely ever see in the game, with a very notable one being their [previous Loved nomination](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1592995#mania/3253520). This time? [Chromology](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1203542#mania/2506167)!

Right off the bat, you might notice the awfully long drain time of 9 minutes and 41 seconds, which is absolutely nothing to scoff at. The patterns themselves are rather hybrid-y, with heavy long note usage among some trickier rice sections. Even then, it's safe to assume a big appeal behind the chart is the song choice, as metal jazz fusion isn't something you come across often! Especially combined with the drain time as stated, the song and chart both go through a ton of different and unique approaches, leading to a diverse but enjoyable experience.

This chart has had a large, but niche audience for the longest time. Now, you can bring that for everyone to see by voting in the thread!

An old one, but a good one.

*Reimei* is one of those rare gems that people stumble upon, enjoy, forget about, and discover again months or years later in a throwback session. I think [Toaph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811) dug this one out for [SOFT6](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/6), while I was introduced to this map through one or the other French national tournament. It was once again, more recently featured within the [osu!mania LN Tournament 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2107840) early game and has always stood as one of [Feraligatr's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7439226) cleanest LN executions. Some may be more familiar with Feraligatr through their other monikers: Drago, Dergo, Kamuy, Nimis.

*Reimei* as an LN map is a quintessential introduction to high-level coordination. It ebbs and flows, but is slow enough that you'll have to think twice about which fingers to let out between transitions. I personally think it's a bit of an underrated and underrepresented aspect of LNs, and this is where the most unique maps stem from. However, it's also really hard to get right because it requires strong conceptualization mapping-wise, which Feraligatr has been historically renowned for.

Do you crave some noodles? You know where to get them. Thread. Vote. Yeah. You know the drill.

*description written by [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785)*

If you're one of those players who miss the nostalgic feeling of old anime and classic O2Jam-style patterns, then you've come to the right place! This pack features a variety of songs from the Spring 2017 anime season, a time filled with some of the most iconic and hyped openings of the era. For this release, [LostCool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/766374) has charted numerous maps across different styles, offering a versatile selection of patterns to enjoy.

The variants in this set include several charts focused on rice patterns, emphasizing skillsets such as speed, delay control, chordstreams, and occasional jack sections. Meanwhile, most of the charts feature denser LN wall patterns combined with shields and unstable releases. These use similar speed-based patterning concepts from the lower difficulties but add greater challenge and accuracy demands, requiring both strong reading ability and precise tapping. Without good accuracy and versatile skill training, you'll definitely be in for a tough time!

Overall, the concepts draw heavy inspiration from old school O2Jam-style patterns but are refined for a smoother, more enjoyable experience. Unlike many older charts, this set minimizes unnecessary spikes and messy sections while maintaining that nostalgic feel. We hope you'll support the map by leaving a positive vote!
