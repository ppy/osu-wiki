44 teams entered the tournament, each carrying the hopes and dreams of their country's communities. Every week saw the elimination of teams more and more prestigious, often ending their journeys sooner than they had hoped. But for the select three who managed to carve their path to the very last round, a glorious podium finish awaited them.

Join us as we look back at this year's World Cup, through highlights and interviews from the ones who brought it to life!

## Summary

![Podium](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-29-osucatch-world-cup-2025-concludes/podium.jpg)

*I wake up, there is another coronation of glory...* Congratulations to Argentina who have been crowned our 2025 osu!catch champions for the first time in history! This is not only Argentina’s first osu!catch title, but also their first win across all game modes, a historic achievement for the country. The reigning champions, the United States, were defeated 7–2 in Grand Finals, finishing as runners-up. And finally, Finland secured a spot on the podium in third place, also a first for the country.

Will this be the start of a new Argentinian dynasty in osu!catch World Cups? Only time will tell — but this victory may well mark a turning point in the tournament's history.

This Grand Finals mappool was without a doubt one of the most difficult we've seen in osu!catch history. With most maps demanding very high mechanical execution and in-depth coverage into each specialised skill, even the remaining teams were pushed to their limits. [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636)'s [Kyokugen BON Odori](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402724#fruits/5210989) (NM2) is a prime example of this, requiring players to hit brutal 230 BPM wiggles alongside heavy tech patterns. As for stamina picks, [Nidoking](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7034422)'s [Angel dust (2016 Radio Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402805#fruits/5211177) (NM3) demanded constant wiggles at a high level of precision, coupled with a low approach rate, across two ruthless minutes of play.

For other slots, players were greeted with some familiar faces. The classic [Daletto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7592136) Hard Rock stream map appeared in the form of [Pain Remains I: Dancing Like Flames](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402732#fruits/5211006) (HR1), alongside the typically unorthodox [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) Double Time control pick with [MYS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402781#fruits/5211124) (DT4). The [osu!mania 7k World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K) Grand Finals' tiebreaker, [Duplicity Shade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1698284#mania/3469849) was also featured as a convert pick in the pool, but as a [cut version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2403136#fruits/5211965) (NM4). The result? A hellish stack gauntlet that overwhelmed every player.

[WangleLine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/427) made her appearance earlier in the tournament with [Island of Orchids](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2384624#fruits/5156307) being used in the Round of 32's mappool. Since then, she's been officially welcomed as a [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-07-13-new-featured-artist-wangleline), and this time her music returned to the mappool as an osu!original with [Goodbye To Your Vicious Cycles](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402735#fruits/5211009) (HD3), mapped by [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462) and [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466). This dark and gritty neuro drum and bass song was the perfect match for them both, who turned it into one of the most terrifying Hidden picks to date. Extremely demanding on both the reading and mechanics, the map and the song are sure to leave players feeling like they went through a nightmare after playing it.

Here we are — the most anticipated part of every World Cup mappool reveal: the **Grand Finals tiebreaker**. And once again, it absolutely delivered. [Yooh](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/218) was back with another World Cup tiebreaker, this time in the form of [Eternity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402789#fruits/5211146). Mapped through a massive collaborative effort by [Zyzyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2888013), [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114), [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284), [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811), and [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466), this beast of a project served as the perfect culmination of everything this tournament had been building toward.

Featuring several original character designs from illustrators [Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312), [HiROdoge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15251809), and [Xiaoraini](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3607337), brought to life through the graphic design work of [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799), [Boolmaster Flex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5394681), and [hourius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298), all combined in the mind-blowing storyboard by [Kuroise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127), [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323), and [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762) — this map hides a mountain of lore and secrets. There's more to experience than words can convey. We strongly urge you to go check it out for yourself!

Throughout the tournament, many people contributed to these mappools, working behind the scenes most of the time. ::{ flag=US }:: [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466), advisor and mappooler for the past three years, will be retiring from his position after this edition. We had the chance to ask him for his thoughts and reflections on his time working on the osu!catch World Cups.

Being an advisor for CWC taught me so many life lessons throughout my 3 year tenure. Due to the workload and management skills required, it made me aware of how I operate as a person as well as what I value. I think that alone made the job worth it to me, however there are parts of the job itself that kept me excited and motivated.

Getting to work with [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) and [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891) on [osu!originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) made me ecstatic. Spending time finding applicable artists that could potentially make an original for our mode is extremely exciting and something I take a lot of pride in. For me personally, [Ice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/484) was the artist that helped get me into rhythm games back in 2013. Getting to request him to make an original this year has got to be one of my favorite moments… ever! It really made me feel like everything came full circle.

I’ve always viewed this role as one that allows people to have fun with a game I care so much about as they play in the biggest tournament catch has to offer. While being an advisor may be hard, my best piece of advice is to find aspects of the job you yourself enjoy and let that motivate you. It’s okay to be a little selfish sometimes if it allows you to do your best and I think thats something everyone needs to hear.

Finally, id like to thank [F D Flourite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2459589) and [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891). These two people believed in me as I did in them, and I wouldn’t have managed in this position without them. I truly loved getting to be an advisor for the last 3 years and hope the person that fills my spot loves it as much as I do.

It is with a grand total of **9** [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) that the tournaments ends, all from very different genres and styles. Many individuals worked tirelessly to make this all possible, from the artists themselves to the illustrators, graphic designers, and storyboarders who helped bring this fantastic line-up to life. Each and every one of them is truly its own experience, so even if you can't play the maps, be sure to give them a listen and appreciate the incredible work that has been put into them.

## Grand Finals recap

### ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

**[View the match information here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118732915)**

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&parent=osu.ppy.sh&time=1h5m4s&video=2517677050" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

It was now time for the long-awaited Grand Finals. Argentina (#2) and the United States (#1), the two clear favourites, standing head and shoulders above the rest, would face off once again. One year ago, Argentina was the one coming out of the losers' bracket in the ultimate match, only to lose 7–4. This time, however, Argentina had sent the United States to the losers' bracket, defeating them in the winners' bracket final 7–4. After a decisive 7–0 victory over Finland, it was now time for the rematch — of both last year's grand final and this year's winners' final.

In their previous match, most of the mappool didn't really favour one team over the other, with both teams contesting each other on most picks — it mainly came down to match performance. This time, however, with the continuous rise in mappool difficulty, and especially mechanical difficulty, it was unclear whether the United States could keep up with the Argentinian roster. All of their core players are well-known within the community for their prowess on fast and stamina-draining maps, which can't really be said about the American roster as a whole, whose strengths mainly lie in other skills.

This would be shown right away with the explosive [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402793#fruits/5211154) being banned by the United States, and the slower, more precision-focused [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402748#fruits/5211044) being Argentina's ban. The first pick would be the same as the one from a week ago, [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402733#fruits/5211007) for Argentina, comfortably won. The United States' first pick, [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402856#fruits/5211272) would be closer, especially thanks to ::{ flag=US }:: [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006) FCing the map for the second time in an hour, but Argentina still prevailed.

They would continue comfortably winning their own picks, with [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402923#fruits/5211451) next, and [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402735#fruits/5211009) later, with a ridiculous 896k from ::{ flag=AR }:: [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283). It looked next to impossible to beat them on their own territory, and this would go on for the rest of the match.

Fortunately for the United States, they still had strengths they could rely on. They picked and won [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402762#fruits/5211092) and [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2403136#fruits/5211965), two of the more awkward and control-based maps. They were only down one point, but with how strong Argentina looked on their own picks and with their best maps now being out of the equation, the situation looked dire.

Argentina went for [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402724#fruits/5210989), one of the more mechanically-demanding picks, and won as expected, with a phenomenal 962k from ::{ flag=AR }:: [SirGonzaxz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17309439). Now up 5–2, they would only need to win their next two picks to secure the title. But it came even faster than that, taking the United States' [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402758#fruits/5211086), and then their own [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402805#fruits/5211177), despite ::{ flag=US }:: [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006)'s one-miss score.

It was over – with a clean 7–2, Argentina had made history, becoming osu!catch World Cup champions for the first time ever. Their performance throughout the whole tournament was nothing short of extraordinary, their roster reaching its full potential this year in order to accomplish this dream of theirs. They had taken their revenge on the reigning champions, and it will now be their turn to defend the title next year. Their own reign had only just begun, and they couldn't have hoped for a better start.

For this year's CWC Grand Finals tiebreaker, [Eternity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402789#fruits/5211146), both [Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312) and [Kuroise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127) made a return to World Cup designs. [Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312) worked on the character illustrations, continuing his work from previous years with [Evreka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2011570#fruits/4185911) in CWC 2023 and [step by step](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2191164#fruits/4634684) in CWC 2024. [Kuroise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127) was responsible for the storyboard creation, following his previous role as storyboarder for [BUZZ CUTZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2358247#taiko/5090722) in [TWC 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025).

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

Welcome back to another Grand Finals tiebreaker project. To start off, could you both briefly introduce yourselves and share a bit about your design experience in the community?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kyuare.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312">Kyuare</a></p>

Hi hi I'm Kyuare, a very old catch mapper who spent his entire life drawing. When I have free time I'm making cool art for [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music).

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kuroise.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127">Kuroise</a></p>

Good morning! I'm Kuroise! Some may know me for being an osu!standard mapper as my storyboarding career is relatively new. I've technically been storyboarding since 2020, although mostly as a casual hobby. In late 2024 I've had the chance to expand my storyboarding knowledge with the help of my mentor [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323), and I've been starting to storyboard seriously from there. During that period, I've switched from solely using the osu! editor to also including [scripting](/wiki/Storyboard/Scripting). It's a less popular technique as it requires you to edit each individual sprite and command associated with it instead of writing a code that does the script for you.

I don't have many storyboards to showcase, but my strength in narrative design is reflected in my maps for [SeventH-HeaveN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2293637#osu/4897782) and the recent [TWC 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025) Grand Finals tiebreaker [BUZZ CUTZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2358247#taiko/5090722). That project was a storyboard collaboration with [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436), [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762), and [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323), where I played a major role in shaping the underlying story.

With CWC 2025's Grand Finals Tiebreaker done, I'm currently sitting at a total of 16 storyboards completed (although 4 deleted). I'm also following my mentor's steps and became a storyboard mentor myself!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

By now, many viewers have come to recognise that each [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) tiebreaker carries its own distinct atmosphere and narrative. When you first joined this project, what were your initial impressions of the song? How did [Yooh](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/218)'s suggestions and feedback influence lore planning within the design team?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kyuare.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312">Kyuare</a></p>

The moment I heard the song, I knew we were about to create banger designs. Many ideas surged into my mind, and I had to start sketching them out right away to capture the initial creative momentum.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-29-osucatch-world-cup-2025-concludes/eternitydesign1.png)

My strength really shines during the conceptual phase, where I excel at interpreting abstract instrumental tracks without lyrics, and then transforming them into cool visual ideas. Yooh granted a lot of creative freedom, so it was important for our design team to get a strong direction right from the start to keep everyone's ideas organized. I created multiple sketches based on our initial team discussion, and I'm glad those sketches were able to set a nice foundation for us to build on.

Later during production, I further expanded the sketches into more visual references, helping everyone understand the intended mood and narrative direction while still leaving space for individual creativity.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-29-osucatch-world-cup-2025-concludes/eternitydesign2-2.png)

This created a great synergy. Everyone felt empowered to contribute, which elevated both the ambition and cohesion of the project. The result was a team-wide focus on storytelling, and a lore that felt genuinely alive.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kuroise.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127">Kuroise</a></p>

I've always loved Yooh's works. My favorite World Cup tiebreaker is [RPG](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1633250#osu/3333745) after all. When I got a chance to participate in this project, I was beyond ecstatic. Yooh's design suggestions leaned towards angels, battle and salvation. Like Kyuare mentioned, Yooh gave us a lot of liberty in designing a character that fits the song. Although he didn't ask for the designs to be focused on storytelling, me and Kyuare wanted to create a story for the song. We envisioned a story about an immortal queen once respected for her wisdom, who falls into corruption and grief as her kingdom crumbles and she becomes a shadow of her former self. After Kyuare sketched out our main character Lucine, I started planning what the general narrative of each song section would be. With Noffy also collaborating on the storyboard, we were able to plan out most of the story during the first week of production.

I also decided to have the lore encrypted throughout the video and storyboard to build a more mysterious feeling. That's why we created Lucine Crypt, a fully decodable font.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-29-osucatch-world-cup-2025-concludes/eternitydesign3.png)

I'm glad to see many people were able to piece together the story soon after the song is released. For those who haven't yet, I encourage you to take a closer look. The entire lore is hidden in the design, waiting to be discovered.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

Every tiebreaker project is a shared accomplishment made possible by the combined efforts of all design roles—illustrators, graphic designers, visual effects designers, storyboarders, and many more. You each played different roles in shaping how the story is visually conveyed. What parts of your work did you find most challenging, and how did the teamwork between these roles come together for this project?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kyuare.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312">Kyuare</a></p>

The most challenging part for me was definitely my role as the lead illustrator. It wasn't just about creating art, it was about keeping a unified visual direction from start to finish. The character design reference sheets I created defined the overall aesthetic, ensuring everyone could align their work around a clear vision. Beyond planning the visual direction, I also helped assign illustration responsibilities, offering detailed feedback, and sometimes polishing or adjusting details to maintain consistency and harmony. It was a delicate balance between leadership and collaboration.

We had [Hiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15251809) and [Xiaoraini](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3607337) collaborating on the illustrations. Both of them did phenomenal work. They quickly understood the vision, delivered high-quality work quickly, and brought their own flair to the project. Our character Lucine started with her "light form" in the first half of the song, so I figured Hiro's cute and vibrant drawing style would fit better. After Lucine made a "dark form" transformation in the second half of the song, Xiaoraini's dynamic texture drawing style were able to shine.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-29-osucatch-world-cup-2025-concludes/eternitydesign4.png)

I filled the gaps between them, and I'm quite happy the final result is that harmonious despite having 3 illustrators with different drawing styles.

Aside from completing illustrations, we also frequently gathered feedback from other design roles like storyboarders, graphic designers, and also VFX designers. The final product being presented on showcase is truly a collaborative achievement. It was a joy to see everyone bringing their strengths to the table in such a synchronized way.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kuroise.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127">Kuroise</a></p>

Most of my prior storyboard experience has been with songs that include lyrics, which helps me vision the emotional context of each storyboard scene. The challenging part of this project for me was to do storyboard planning without lyrics. On top of that, the most challenging part for me was creating the final boss fight in storyboard. I had the idea from the very beginning, but I didn't really know how to do it. After spending weeks experimenting, I'm glad that I managed to make something basically unheard of in the storyboarding community. At the same time, I'm thankful I wasn't alone on this project.

As mentioned before, Kyuare laid the groundwork with the early sketches, which made scene planning easier. Noffy broke down the story into sections, helping us to think through each part without getting overwhelmed. On the illustration side, Hiro and Xiaoraini gave life to Lucine with their distinct illustration styles and added cohesion to the visual flow between scenes. [Len](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34098325) and [Polytetral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8612061) worked on the video simultaneously as we planned everything, offering even more scene ideas and cinematic renders for us to use. Graphic design was done by [Panthullu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298), [Boolmaster Flex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5394681), and [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799), who did amazing collaboration to create the background and cover designs of the song. Supporting the team behind the scenes, our design quality assurance members [Saturn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22001295), [TheFunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13981991), and [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762) ensured everything stayed on track across their respective expertise. Finally, [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) brought everyone together, coordinated the project and established the foundation for the design workflow.

This project wasn't just a design effort. We also had [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114), [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284), [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811), [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466), and [Zyzyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2888013) working tirelessly on the map, with [fayew](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12498861) doing hitsounding and [qwhj79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7547506) contributing to the replay. It truly felt like a team accomplishment across all staff members. Honestly, if even one person had been missing, I don't think this project would have been possible.

::{ flag=AR }:: [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283), captain of team Argentina and now fresh osu!catch Champion, answered a couple of questions regarding him and his team's achievement this year.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Realmaas.jpg')"></a>

Hello and congrats on winning! What was your main motivation going into this CWC considering your second-place finish last year, and how did you and your team react to this year's outcome?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Story-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283">-Story-</a></p>

First of all, Thanks for the compliment!!!
Now going for answering the question, I think the motivation came from the effort we put into CWC 2024, and I think that partly gave us the confidence to believe we could win a World Cup. However, many difficulties arose when it came to recovering players from the previous CWC (including myself) due to the lack of time and personal issues from each member.
Regarding the results, I think it's something we've been expecting since we entered the CWC 2025, as we went in with a pretty strong and solid mentality regarding our abilities. Even so, we couldn't believe we were finally winning a World Cup, especially [VelperK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/348467), who has been playing since 2010 with a clear dream to win one in his life.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Realmaas.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-loved" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640">Realmaas</a></p>

How did your team approach or prepare for this year's bracket? Did anything change compared to previous years?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Story-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283">-Story-</a></p>

Last year I feel like I performed very well as captain in terms of deciding what to pick and what strategy to use to win matches, but this year I felt more relaxed regarding practice, choosing picks and at the team's level. Our way of practicing is simple: we take maps that we consider difficult and then organize them into a Google Sheet to upload scores and improve on the current type of maps within the year to understand the lastest skillsets from 2025. So, pretty much we changed a bit the strategy and choose things where we could feel more comfortability.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Realmaas.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-loved" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640">Realmaas</a></p>

After this year's win, motivation seems to be at an all-time high in the Argentinian community. What can we expect from your team in the future?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Story-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283">-Story-</a></p>

I'm very happy with everyone who congratulated us, and I'm not just talking about Argentina when I say that we truly received a LOT of support. It's undoubtedly a great memory for us, and it means a lot, even though there's some support and also hate but we choose to focus on the effort it took to get here, day after day.

None of this would have been achieved without the motivation we had as a team, as a family, as a friendship. We went through a lot but I would like to thank the friends i have as colleagues. My best friends are [Zeus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8329151), [Alex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17738253), [VelperK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/348467), [Naarkz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19490380), [Gonza](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17309439) and I want to say thanks for everything to them and for the supporters that were there every single match and day to pray for our win ❤️

Now... Regarding the Catch World Cup, I think it will depend on several factors that allow us to have or make time to play them, but we no longer have the pressure of being champions because we already are. Having fun and accepting that the game is a game is the key to understand that you don't have to take things too seriously and that no matter how much people judge you, whether you win or lose, it doesn't matter! You have to enjoy having teammates, moments where you fall and get up, situations where you don't feel like you're what you demonstrated in practice, and much more.

Take the World Cup as a place to explore a more competitive and healthy environment where you can have fun and play with your friends.
Don't overthink too much and enjoy what this is, just a game that we all love.

See you next year, I'm hoping to play with all my friends again and again because they are the ones that motivate me to keep playing.
