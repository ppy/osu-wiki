Instead of announcing a new Featured Artist this weekend, we're putting the spotlight on an older one: **Akiri** is back, adding a boatload of new songs to their Featured Artist collection!

For anyone not in the know, **Akiri** (a.k.a. [ERA Akiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19587411) here on osu!) is a devout key smasher who [debuted as a Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-02-11-new-featured-artist-akiri) during [last year's osu!mania 7K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_7K) with a grandiose [7-minute tiebreaker track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEHMtQxhzqM)! It's been a year since then, and **Akiri** was eager to bring their newest tunes to osu!, so here we are.

**30** new tracks are now part of [**Akiri**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/401). You'll find them with this not-so-creative **NEW** tag:

As per usual, every song below (and more) can be found on [**Akiri**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/401) as pre-timed `.osz` files. Open these in the editor and do your thing.

Anyways, music awaits:

### [Akiri - Evolutionary Anima](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/401/Songs/Akiri_-_Evolutionary_Anima.osz)

One of those new tracks comes straight out of [2025's osu!mania 7K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K): [*Evolutionary Anima*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314344) mapped by [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785) and [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196).

If you tune into [this weekend's matches](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive), you might see this map played by one of the surviving teams!
