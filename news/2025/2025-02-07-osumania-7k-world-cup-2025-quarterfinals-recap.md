Only a few weeks ahead of us remain! As the teams continue to fight for a chance to stay on top, let's take a moment to remember this week's fallen heroes.

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K/img/mwc7k2025-banner.jpg)

We get one week of respite compared to how hectic the previous rounds were, but it is way too soon for players to relax, even for those who remain uncontested! The mappools are only going to get harder and harder as we reach the end of the line. As such, we're starting to see the difference between the teams who were able to keep up the tournament's pace, versus those who are already struggling while adjusting to these newfound challenges.

Do expect things to heat up in the weeks to come! 12 very strong teams remain, ranging from seed #13 all the way up to #1. The fact that there weren't many upsets during the earlier rounds means that this is going to be a very stacked finale for the tournament. But enough about the future, let us recap last week's Quarterfinals!

Both [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895) and [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550) with their new assistant [Nerfox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7976724) have prepared yet another recap in video form for Quarterfinals! This might be the best way to enjoy the recap while completing your favourite gacha game's dailies.

If this week's scores are anything to go by, players must have been starting to feel the effects of the ever-increasing difficulty of the maps as we reach the latter half of the tournament! No wonder this is the case with some of this round's heavy hitters taking a toll on players who weren't able to keep up with the pace.

Not only did we get a substantial bump in difficulty, but the pool's size was also increased! With a change of format to a best of 11 instead of 9, two new maps alongside new categories were added to the pool.

The first map to be introduced was [69 de 74 - Grievous Fate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314385#mania/4952820) (RC6) mapped by [Level 51](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3617847), providing players with a new challenge in the form of fast chordstreams. The second and final addition was [Monster Siren Records & Kirara Magic - Fu Da Huang](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314248#mania/4952550) (LN4) by [Muses](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9705896) which brings back the LN coordination category previously held by LN1 in past years! A very divisive pick considering it was banned the most out of this week's pool, that is 9 times across 16 different matches.

We only got one returning [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#official-tournament-releases) this weekend, coming from the hands of [_Stan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1653229) by mapping [Gram vs. DJ Genki - XIchedelic Nova Trinity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314398#mania/4952876) (HB1) which was once featured in the [osu! World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024) — the very last official tournament of 2024! This osu!mania rendition came to be a rather standard hybrid beatmap for those teams that could not commit to its trickier technical and mini-tiebreaker counterparts.

As for this week's stand-outs, besides LN4 we got [PASOCOM MUSIC CLUB feat. punipunidenki - i s o p h o t e](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314588#mania/4953343) (HB2) made by [lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573), which was the most popular hybrid pick this week. The technical hybrid of the week provided players with a dump-styled map akin to 4K maps. Its unique layering of vocals managed to offer a challenging experience while being fun to play!

The first osu! original to be debuted in this year's tournament was [Evolutionary Anima](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314344#mania/4952725) (RC5) by [Akiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/401). To the surprise of many, this was not the tiebreaker!

Handcrafted by [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785) and [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196), the map (and song!) was purpose-made for the mixed rice category of this round's mappool. At 173 BPM, players were in for fast streams and jacks all over. That did not scare away the players however, as the map got picked a whole 10 times this weekend, making it a very popular pick all things considered! Whether it be for its very fun gameplay or catchy tunes, players were eager to give this map a shot in most of the matches that were played.

If we were to compare this round's results to previous weeks, it'd become clear that this has been a relatively calm round. Not to be mistaken with a lack of highlights — we've got plenty of those in store!

With less than half of qualified teams remaining, this has been one hell of an inflection point for most of the remaining teams. It would either spell doom for those running on their second wind, or force higher-seeded teams to take their chances and drop to a lower bracket.

This was also the week where conditional matches were introduced. For some, this would mean requiring an extra effort just to get a chance to play for another week. Venezuela, Germany, Spain, France, Peru, and Chile were such teams. While unfortunately some didn't make it, all of them gave their all in the end.

With all the background out of the way, let's get into the meat of this recap (the match highlights).

### ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan vs. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia

Japan (#4) versus Indonesia (#5) was bound to be a match between two titans fighting for their spot in the winners' bracket. Japan is well known for their strong rice skill thanks to ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [rainlily](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/485007). With their returning teammates, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Suzuha_l](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6132697) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [[ misa ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10011429), this made for an overall more balanced team as opposed to their opponents. Indonesia on the other hand has very strong LN players, courtesy of ::{ flag=ID }:: [Onta_Bekasi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8677684) being a force to be reckoned with throughout this tournament's history. With the help of ::{ flag=ID }:: [_yea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20834055) and ::{ flag=ID }:: [[ -Asriel- ]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11829623) alongside ::{ flag=ID }:: [RaffCo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7589503)'s consistency on rice sets, this made Indonesia yet another fairly well-balanced team. Given each team's strengths, this would be a match where hybrid maps would play a key role in their success.

It should not be a surprise that Japan chose to protect [Ito Kanako - Tataeshi Tatakai no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314259#mania/4952567) (RC3), whereas Indonesia protected [Monster Siren Records & Kirara Magic - Fu Da Huang](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314248#mania/4952550) (LN4), with Indonesia banning [Sound piercer & ginkiha (feat. Yuzuha & NeLiME) - MI:LIGHT CONNECT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314240#mania/4952529) (RC2) and Japan banning the very opposite by choosing [YURRY CANON - Tsukuyomi Step (feat. nameless)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314243#mania/4952535) (LN2). With Japan starting the match with RC3 and winning with no less than the best team score on said map, and Indonesia following up with LN3, the signature strengths of both teams were at full display. They were not going to hold back any punches!

However, just knowing what the other team has in store isn't enough, meaning neither team could hit the brakes for even a split second. Despite Japan's strong rice players, Indonesia wasn't any less great at it. The same could be said the other way around. Japan almost learnt it the hard way when they picked [Silentroom - Aliake (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314239#mania/4952522) (RC1) and Indonesia managed to almost even out their score with a 582-point difference. This forced Indonesia to pick their protect and get some ground back, bringing the score back up to 2–2.

The rice versus long note picks continued all the way up to 3–3. Indonesia was out of LN maps to choose from, while Japan had plenty of options left. With Japan winning [69 de 74 - Grievous Fate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314385#mania/4952820) (RC6) and upping the lead to 4–3, Indonesia had no choice but to start picking the remaining hybrid maps. This ended up with Indonesia picking [PASOCOM MUSIC CLUB feat. punipunidenki - i s o p h o t e](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314588#mania/4953343) (HB2), leading to a very contested point between ::{ flag=ID }:: [RaffCo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7589503) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586)'s full combos. With only a 2,850-point difference, Japan managed to gain the upper hand, getting themselves in a very good position with both a break and match point at 5–3.

Unfortunately, Indonesia was put between a rock and a hard place given Japan's upper hand in the pick. Despite ::{ flag=ID }:: [RaffCo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7589503) and ::{ flag=ID }:: [_yea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20834055)'s very commendable efforts, their doom was already spelled out. By winning [saaa - MORNINGLOOM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314251#mania/4952555) (RC4), Japan won the last point they needed to win the match! In the battle between this tournament's rice and long note titans, this year's skirmish was won by the former.

Indonesia is not out of the game however! They'll get a second chance next weekend against the Russian Federation, in the hopes to climb their way back up to the Finals. At the same time, Japan will not have it any easier since they will be up against South Korea. We hope both teams can perform as well as they did this weekend!

### ::{ flag=VE }:: Venezuela vs. ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany

One of the most exciting matches of the round had to be the duel between Venezuela (#12) and Germany (#13). With a negligible seed gap between the two, and with both teams risking losing their spot in the losers' bracket, we couldn't have expected anything but a fierce match, and certainly not a battle you'd want to miss!

Germany opened the match with a long note pick: [seatrus - Ataraxia (2020 Rework)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314245#mania/4952538) (LN3). This was quite a close win for Germany given their small lead of 6,117 points by the end of the map. Venezuela decided to answer back by picking a more full-flavoured map with [siromaru - Tsuzumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314257#mania/4952564) (HB3), a tiebreaker-styled chart whose varied patterns rewarded Venezuela's more versatile players with a winning lead of 38,239 points, shifting the winds in their favour!

Germany stayed true to their team's strengths and picked [YURRY CANON - Tsukuyomi Step (feat. nameless)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314243#mania/4952535) (LN2), where ::{ flag=DE }:: [TsukiyaWhiskers](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12598261) promptly delivered with a groundbreaking full combo score of 988,634 points! This performance alone gave Germany a significant edge over their rivals, winning them an extra point with a margin of 30,381 points. After this point onwards, the match continued to swing back and forth between the two teams as they continued to pick and win their preferred maps. This all changed on the 6th pick, when Venezuela picked [Akiri - Evolutionary Anima](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314344#mania/4952725) (RC5). Much to their dismay, Germany managed to pull ahead, awarding them with the match's first break point and a 2–4 lead over their rivals.

Interestingly, every pick chosen by either team from this point onwards was won by the opposing side, in stark contrast to the first half of the match. Despite Germany reaching match point after winning [Silentroom - Aliake (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314239#mania/4952522) (RC1), Venezuela stood strong and won Germany's counterpick [69 de 74 - Grievous Fate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314385#mania/4952820) (RC6) after a very impressive double full combo by the hands of ::{ flag=VE }:: [sir aelay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12055954) and ::{ flag=VE }:: [xShyzDy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13545528), narrowing Germany's lead down to 4–5.

This was Venezuela's last chance at forcing a tiebreaker. After some much needed consideration, Venezuela chose to play [Sound piercer & ginkiha (feat. Yuzuha & NeLiME) - MI:LIGHT CONNECT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314240#mania/4952529) (RC2). This turned into quite an intense, nail-biting showdown, with the score lead constantly alternating between the two teams. In the end, nerves got the best of team Venezuela, and after an impressive full combo yet again from ::{ flag=DE }:: [TsukiyaWhiskers](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12598261), team Germany emerged victorious!

Congratulations to Germany for advancing to the next round, and a big round of applause to Venezuela for their performance both throughout the match and the entire tournament! It is no easy feat to push Germany to their very limits, despite being considered the underdogs. We hope to see them soon in the future, even stronger than they were this year!

## Score highlights

We may not have had a large repertoire of memorable matches. Instead, we've got a few impressive scores to highlight coming from all teams! The next scores are only but a few of the highlights that this week had to offer:

- [Ito Kanako - Tataeshi Tatakai no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314259#mania/4952567) (RC3) saw three players hit the coveted 999k score, a feat easier said than done with Score V2! ::{ flag=KR }:: [Kalkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10790649) obtained a 58x300 run, ::{ flag=PE }:: [-luvv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23731514) got one less with 57x300, and ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) topped the weekend with 56x300. The consistency of these players is definitely something to admire.
- [Monster Siren Records & Kirara Magic - Fu Da Huang](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314248#mania/4952550) (LN4) may have not seen much action over the weekend, but we still witnessed a noodle masterclass from ::{ flag=CN }:: [[Crz]Satori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082178) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) who obtained the only 990,000-point scores on the chart.
- We'd also like to point the spotlight to ::{ flag=PH }:: [arcwinolivirus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089)' weekend-topping efforts courtesy of their 987,225-point full combo on [PASOCOM MUSIC CLUB feat. punipunidenki - i s o p h o t e](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314588#mania/4953343) (HB2), and a 971,167 score run on [siromaru - Tsuzumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2314257#mania/4952564) (HB3).
