This week's mappool brought yet another challenging and loaded selection of custom maps, designed to push players to their limits. As usual, this round features contributions from several familiar names in the mapping scene, each bringing their own styles and creativity to this stage of the tournament.

The first map to be introduced was [Camellia feat. Nanahira - Shakunetsu Candle Master](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391746#fruits/5177625) (NM1), mapped by a collaboration between [Mochi -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20424806) and [Kukkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7811952). Serving as this round's consistency pick, it was the first map of the tournament to stand above 7 stars, setting the tone for what players could expect moving forward as we get to the later stages of the tournament. Another standout was [BilliumMoto - LINK[INIT]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391752#fruits/5177635) (HD3), being [sololiquy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4350087)'s first appearance this edition, delivering a high-AR Hidden challenge that focused on both precision and control.

We also had a throwback to a previous edition with [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598)'s [Lone Digger](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391931#fruits/5178116) (HD1), very similar to a previous map of his from CWC 2021, [Dragons](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1464027#fruits/3007191), but this time with Hidden. And once again, [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391796#fruits/5177786) was back with a classic [Culprate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/29) map in [Lightfold](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391796#fruits/5177786) (MM1), being the first one this year compared to last year's three.

This week, not one but two [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) made their appearance in the mappool!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-05-osucatch-world-cup-2025-quarterfinals-recap/Heliosphere_Banner.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391836#fruits/5177897)

</div>

The first one to be showcased was [Heliosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391836#fruits/5177897) by [Vorso](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/303), slotted in as the No Mod 3. [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466) was unsurprisingly the mapper behind it, his unorthodox style aligning perfectly with Vorso's hectic track. The result is an intense gimmick pick featuring high-density sections, tricky sliders, harsh snaps, and complex rhythms. Go play it â€” it's a blast.

</div>

The biggest project of the week came in the form of the tiebreaker, with [Symholic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/130) delivering us a five-and-a-half minutes long symphonic rock track in [Veil of Ash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391791#fruits/5177767), featuring Rina Komatsu. The map by [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891) features fairly conventional patterning, but quickly turns into a very mechanically demanding marathon due to the intensity of the track. This was a large collaborative effort, so be sure to check out the end result by clicking on the video above!

With this year's Quarterfinals done and dusted, the tournament now enters its most intense phase yet. Only four teams remain in the winners' bracket, each holding strong through high-stakes matches, weathering intense pressure and fierce competition alike. As the gaps between teams continues to narrow and the dust begins to settle, we have to bid farewell to the following teams who fought valiantly but were ultimately eliminated from the tournament: ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom, ::{ flag=ES }:: Spain, ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore, ::{ flag=CO }:: Colombia, ::{ flag=MX }:: Mexico, ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong, ::{ flag=CN }:: China, ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia, ::{ flag=BE }:: Belgium, ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan, ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany, and ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden.

Huge Congratulations to all of them for making it this far in the tournament, and we hope to you see again next year! With that being said, let's dive into some match highlights of this weekend!

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden vs. ::{ flag=AU }:: Australia

**[You can view the match information here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118526625)**\

    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&parent=osu.ppy.sh&time=1h34m54s&video=2498078516" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

To anyone who watched this past weekend's matches the Sweden (#16) vs. Australia (#22) one is for sure the highlight of the round. For the past two years, these two teams have met each other in the Round of 32, with Australia winning twice. This year however, it was in the losers' bracket of the Quarterfinals that they would meet, with the higher stakes of elimination taking their newly formed rivalry to a new level.

The match started out as one would expect, with both teams trading points back and forth on their own picks. Sweden opted for [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391796#fruits/5177786) and [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391752#fruits/5177635), with a notable FC from ::{ flag=SE }:: [amni sd](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16669841) on the latter, showing off their strong Hidden abilities. As for Australia, they knew their strength lied in Double Time and Hard Rock, and picked [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391770#fruits/5177673) and [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2393172#fruits/5181836), winning on them comfortably. Each team knew their strengths and weaknesses, and each map was won with a clear advantage to the team picking it.

What broke this dynamic was Sweden's [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391931#fruits/5178116) pick, which Australia ended up winning by only 2,286 points. Conceding a break point in a match in which both teams look really comfortable on their own picks is never good, as it can be enough to close out a match without going to the tiebreaker. But to everyone's surprise, it was now Sweden that would win on Australia's comfort Mod, on [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391758#fruits/5177654). The scoreline was now even again.

After that, the match went back to each team winning on their own picks, with Sweden going for [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391742#fruits/5177621) and [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391780#fruits/5177728), and Australia for [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391789#fruits/5177759) and [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1599662#fruits/3276780). With neither team being able to pull ahead, it was now time for the tiebreaker. I would recommend that you go and watch it, as it was one of the most exciting points of the tournament so far, only decided by around 5 thousand points. Sweden ended up as the winners of this matchup for the first time in 3 years, with a finish that both teams are sure to remember for years.

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland

**[You can view the match VOD here!](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2499104106?t=0h5m45s)**

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&parent=osu.ppy.sh&time=0h5m45s&video=2499104106" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>

This year, the Russian Federation (#3) and Finland (#6) are two teams with both the potential and the ambition to reach for the podium, so them facing off in the winners' bracket made for a very anticipated match. With two undefeated teams so far (save for Finland losing a single point against the UK), this match would be the opportunity to see them finally pushed to their limits. The Russian Federation would make great use of their consistency, notably on the more generic Hard Rock and Double Time picks, and Finland would go for the trickier and more gimmicky maps.

Following that logic, Finland went for [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391758#fruits/5177654) and [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391836#fruits/5177897), with a very impressive SS from ::{ flag=FI }:: [Veeti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12863098) on the latter, while the Russian Federation went for [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391847#fruits/5177925). Both teams were winning their own picks, until the Russian players met with their first obstacle of the match on [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391789#fruits/5177759). Here they lost their own consistency gamble against a very consistent Finnish roster, with ::{ flag=FI }:: [Leinou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391789#fruits/5177759) securing the SS this time. The Russian Federation wanted to go for the raw mechanics and consistency picks, but their opponent was feeling just as good as them on these maps.

The same happened after a successful [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391780#fruits/5177728) pick from Finland, as the Russian Federation lost on [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391746#fruits/5177625) against a double FC from ::{ flag=FI }:: [JonZku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12740132) and ::{ flag=FI }:: [Veeti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12863098) once again, despite ::{ flag=RU }:: [Nelly](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4741164)'s own FC. The Russian Federation managed to claw back to 3â€“5 with strong performances on [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391770#fruits/5177673) and [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2393172#fruits/5181836), but Finland only had to win one point to close out the match, which ended up happening on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391752#fruits/5177635) then and there.

Despite solid performances from the Russian Federation, Finland managed to win thanks to their consistency and ability to perform on all mod pools, upsetting the third seed. They will continue their run in the winners' bracket, where even greater challenges await them, while the Russian Federation will have to fight to stay in the tournament in the losers' bracket.

This week, we got to ask a couple of questions to [Creameries](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15851364), who worked as the illustrator for one of this week's [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals), [Heliosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391836#fruits/5177897).

Would you mind telling us a bit about your experience/history on osu! making art?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15851364" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Creameries.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-white" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15851364">Creameries</a></p>

I started making art for osu in 2020, in which I joined the [Theme Park](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/107) contest with the help of my older brother. After the results, I became interested in participating in all of them. I actually remember telling my friends that I want to win the art contest so that I could be a part of the osu! team, but the more I saw the kind of illustration projects the more I felt a bit demotivated. Though my mind changed slightly when I participated in the [Beach Episode](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/179), [Halloween 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/186) and [A Place to Belong](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/142) when a bunch of people came to me and said "Hey! Your art is good!". Some of them has been used for backgrounds, in which back in 2020, a friend of mine asked if I could draw a background for [Stargazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1251737#osu/2601733), in which I agreed. Still, I felt really hesitant on being someone's illustrator.

Most of my "contributions" in osu! has primarily been in the contests. Even my [first skin](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1632482) was made for the [Chromatic Alteration](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/148) contest.

Though in 2024, I was lucky enough to be picked as an illustrator for some tournaments, mainly [Perrenial](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1924994) ([Sydosys - Coriolis](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202795)) [Battle of The Box](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1862856) ([What's Up? Pop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2134391)) and [Suiji Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1907817)'s Grandfinals Tiebreaker ([Evreka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2203192))

What was it like working on the *Heliosphere* beatmap project, and how does it compare to your solo works or art collabs?

Working on Heliosphere as my first official osu! project was exhilarating. I was so excited, I wanted to give out my best. I actually talked about what I felt in my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Creameliux/status/1937387556251009377). The process is similar to my past projects, but with a bit of pressure since more eyes would be on it. It's kinda scary, but it was fun!

Only 12 teams remain in the upcoming Semifinals, which will see another 6 teams eliminated. We are approaching the endgame, and only the strongest competitors will be able to keep going.

Tons of exciting matches are on the way, so be sure to visit the [CWC wiki page](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025) to keep track of the action happening over at [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) and [osulive_2](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive_2). See you there!
