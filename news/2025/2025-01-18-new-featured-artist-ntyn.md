Taiwanese producer **ntyn** isn't someone who sticks to a single style. He's an artist who specialises in a bunch of genres, switching between calm orchestral pieces and exciting pop tracks effortlessly.

**6** songs (available as pre-timed `.osz` files) are officially part of [**ntyn**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/456). Pick out a song and start mapping already.

Check everything out:

### [ntyn - We Love Idol, and Master! (Chiptune)](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/456/Songs/ntyn%20-%20We%20Love%20Idol%2C%20and%20Master!%20(Chiptune).osz)

Here on osu!, his most recognisable tune is a chiptune rendition of [We Love Idol, and Master!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2258940) hosted by [Daycore](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5596337), showcasing just one side of **ntyn**'s multi-genre capabilities.

Think long and hard about your next move. You can either distract yourself with something else, *orrrrrrr* you can choose one of the songs from [**ntyn**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/456) and create a map that'll last forever.

The secret third option: wait until next weekend for another Featured Artist release.

Stay tuned.
