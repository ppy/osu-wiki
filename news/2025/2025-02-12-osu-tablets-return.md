While mouse can (do) everything, it wouldn't hurt to try out the most iconic input method osu! has to offer.

Over 10 years ago, we offered a series of tablets on [the osu! store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/listing).

And they had problems.

Those [old school osu!tablets](/wiki/Guides/Tablet_purchase#osu!store) had input detection issues and a *heavy* battery inside the pen, leading to less-than-ideal circle clicking conditions. Also if anyone still has one in active use, very sorry about the degrading rubberised coating on the pen which has become a sticky mess!

Despite their downsides, early osu!tablets were still popular among first-time tablet users. Tablets often recommended by pro players were more expensive, and beginners naturally wanted to test the waters before diving in with a pricey peripheral.

The tradeoffs between "introductory" and "pro player" tablets are tough to balance, so... we'll leave the choice to you.

We plan to offer two osu!tablets: the [**intro tablet**](#intro-tablet) and the [**pro tablet**](#pro-tablet)!

This tablet co-produced with **XPPen** has everything you could ask for:

True to its name, the ***intro* tablet** even has instructions and recommendations for setting up a tablet in-game!

But of course, this isn't *just* a tablet. It's a *beautiful* tablet. Send all of your appreciation to veteran mapper [meiikyuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1043627) for the design!

If you feel an urge to keep your osu!tablet on display instead of on your desk, we fully understand.

And when you're not setting top plays, you can keep your tablet safely away from dust in the *official osu! box*. (Note: It's a normal box.)

Pick up your own osu!tablet on [**the store page**](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1447). Available in **limited stock for immediate shipping** (with future re-stocks based on demand).

## pro tablet

...is coming later this year!

In collaboration with **Wacom**, we're already in the production stages for a tablet that suits players who want the highest calibre of circle clicking.

While we usually wouldn't announce upcoming products like this, we feel it is only right that we do so for those which would rather wait for this model. If you're exclusively interested in a tablet that top players would advocate for (and you're okay with a somewhat higher price tag), sit tight until everything is ready. Note that the pro tablet will have its own **unique design**, so you're also more than welcome to collect them all!

Desperate to know exactly when the **pro tablet** will be here? Head to [the **pro tablet**'s future store page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448) and hit the "Notify me when available!" button.
