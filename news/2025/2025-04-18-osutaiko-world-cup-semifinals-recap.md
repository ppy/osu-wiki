## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

Going into this losers' bracket match, the United States (#3) had the [pick'em](https://pickem.hwc.hr/tournaments/166) votes on their side by quite a significant margin. This meant that they had to outperform their opponent China (#7), in order to live up to the people that believed in them. Being the higher-seeded team also put extra pressure on the players of the U.S., yet nobody could've expected what this match held in store for us.

Early into the match, we knew that both teams are known for different skill sets, thus expecting a very close match. Starting strong, the United States decided to go with [P4koo - Hyperlight. (feat. Tsuyuri Karin)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351019#taiko/5059246) (NM2) for their first pick. Despite the combo advantage for China, the U.S. won their pick by just 4,855 points due to having better accuracy. The game was on!

The first real upset happened very shortly after the match started. The United States decided to go with another No Mod pick, this time it was [tv room - Know It All](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2149103#taiko/4527330) (NM6) for which the players prepared themselves. The very difficult speedy tech pick took a toll on the players from the U.S., who struggled quite a bit during the first half of the map. This led to China being able to just run away with the score and then picking up their first break point of this match with an outstanding FC from ::{ flag=CN }:: [superSSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4315477). Taking this momentum, China immediately went with [cluli - they besties](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2350993#taiko/5059153) (HD1). This Chinese roster is known for being good with Hidden, so they had barely any issues winning this pick.

It didn't take long for the United States to come back in full glory however. Winning the next 4 picks consecutively definitely helped putting extra pressure on China. First, the U.S. picked [WyvernP - White Devil](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2194042#taiko/4641645) (NM3). Despite a really good score from ::{ flag=CN }:: [superSSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4315477), the U.S. had the better accuracy across the board. China answered by picking the other Hidden map in the pool, namely [The Ghost Of 3.13 - Forgotten](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351057#taiko/5059325) (HD2) thinking they can outperform the United States again. However, with 2 FCs on board for the U.S. from ::{ flag=US }:: [Miniature Lamp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9821194) and ::{ flag=US }:: [R J](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6490509) the United States won their first break point, tying the score to 3–3.

Bringing the score to a stunning 5-3 for the United States, there was only one last map to win for them to advance into the Finals round. But China wasn't done yet. Winning [tn-shi - Annihilation in F# Minor](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351018#taiko/5059245) (HR2) and [aoi08 - j9fqo80fdgcr](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2350992#taiko/5059144) (NM4) tied the score back again, with an incredible score from ::{ flag=CN }:: [WLYMinato](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12703319) taking this already so intense match to tiebreaker.

The pressure in the lobby increased as the tiebreaker [Sydosys - Partition](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351137#taiko/5059512) was selected by the referee. The score lead ever so slightly stayed on the Chinese side as both teams found a couple of misses in the first half of the map. Going into the second half however, China pulled through until the very end and defeated the United States, who unfortunately continued to find very unlucky misses. One FC still on the board on each team, from ::{ flag=CN }:: [Michaelonl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12480076) and ::{ flag=US }:: [SilverTyrant](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14356353), it wasn't enough for the United States as a supportive combo was missing. Against all odds, the Chinese team has proven themselves and will advance to the Finals round.

### ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore vs. ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom

The Semifinals of this year's osu!taiko World Cup closed out with an incredible match between two unexpected titans. Singapore (#4) returned after taking a break during 2024, blowing everyone's expectations out of the water with their 4th-place seeding. Similarly, the United Kingdom (#10) has been surpassing expectations despite a very different roster of players that led them to their 2nd-place result last year. This left everyone asking "which of these two underdogs will be making their appearance in the finals?".

The UK kicked off the match strong, warm-up checking Singapore by picking the speedy [WyvernP - White Devil](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2194042#taiko/4641645) (NM3) and securing a comfortable first point. Singapore then opened up the Free Mod pool, using their starting pick on [Rabbit House & Evin a'k - optimal solution](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2321605#taiko/4973868) (FM1) and taking a decisive win despite no mod advantage.

Sticking with the No Mod pool, the United Kingdom responded by picking [P4koo - Hyperlight. (feat. Tsuyuri Karin)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351019#taiko/5059246) (NM2). Unfortunately, this played right into Singapore's hands as they swiftly took a break point into their favour. Singapore then further cemented their lead with an outstanding set of scores on [cluli - they besties](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2350993#taiko/5059153) (HD1). Aiming to ensure they did not give away another break point, the new osu! original, [Kaitendaentai - Aether](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351002#taiko/5059170) (HR1) was picked by the United Kingdom and expertly defended with a near three-way full combo and significant score increase from their earlier match against team Malaysia. Singapore continued to showcase their dominance in the Free Mod pool with a huge upscore of their own on [Tonari no Niwa wa Aoi (NIWASHI+Aoi) - Polacro](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2140365#taiko/4504718) (FM2). ::{ flag=SG }:: [awdse22](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8743513) surprised the world with a HDHR full combo worth 1,097,143 points and the second best score of the weekend!

Searching for any advantage they could get, the UK decided to try their odds on [MiddleIsland - Frailness](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2183900#taiko/5059168) (DT1) and hold strong through the streams and ending finishers to secure the point. Singapore responded by going back to the No Mod pool to flex their reading ability on [aoi08 - j9fqo80fdgcr](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2350992#taiko/5059144) (NM4) achieving a combined total of 20 100s, not to mention ::{ flag=SG }:: [Blerargh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7609510)'s perfect 1,000,000 score! With Singapore now at match point, the United Kingdom smashed it out of the park with the second best team score of the weekend on [tv room - Know It All](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2149103#taiko/4527330) (NM6) with full combos from both ::{ flag=GB }:: [MAZIONGA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8484987) and ::{ flag=GB }:: [rloseise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6793778). The final pick of the match went to [Quarkee - HYPER PSY2K](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351106#taiko/5059418) (NM5), the notoriously risky stream pick. Two thirds into the map, the UK had a minor lead with the point still all to play for, but an unfortunate player disconnect for Singapore just before the break all but guaranteed the crucial break point return to the United Kingdom.

After a well-deserved timeout rest, the final battle would take place on [Sydosys - Partition](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351137#taiko/5059512) (TB) to determine which one of these extraordinary teams would earn their place in the top 6. This incredible osu! original heightened players' nerves to the max with its wide variety of skillsets paired with the stakes at play. In the end, the United Kingdom ran away with the lead, cashing out and securing their place in the Finals with a hard-fought full combo from ::{ flag=GB }:: [MAZIONGA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8484987), as well as a breathtaking 99.55% full combo from ::{ flag=SG }:: [Blerargh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7609510).
