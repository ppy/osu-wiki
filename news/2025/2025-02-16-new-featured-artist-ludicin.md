When life gives you **Ludicin**, you make beatmaps.

Some may know **Ludicin** for their track *Everlasting Eternity* produced for Beat Saber World Cup 2023, but osu! players specifically might recognise **Ludicin** for the Grand Finals tiebreaker in 2025's osu!mania 7K World Cup: [*Lost Requiem*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325151).

Regardless of how anyone knows **Ludicin**, everyone is aware of their musical prowess, and that's why they're one of our Featured Artists!

**11** top tier tracks can be found on [**Ludicin**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/459), all of which will be mapped by **you**. Sorry, you don't have a choice in this matter.

Check everything out:
