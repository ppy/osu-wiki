o!bwc kicked off with a qualifier round featuring all registered teams, followed by four intense clash rounds: Round of 16, Quarterfinal, Semifinal, and Final. In the qualifier round, 61 teams competed for 16 spots in the clash stage. Each clash round consisted of intense head-to-head matchups where only the winners advanced. For full details on the matchups, check out the [o!bwc bracket on Challonge](https://challonge.com/obwc2025) and the [livestream recordings](https://www.youtube.com/@osubwc8023) of each round.

The final stage featured two thrilling matches among the top four teams: ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States for the championship, and ::{ flag=FR }:: France vs. ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan for third place. Both matches competed with the Featured Artist track *[Silentroom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/92) - F1055*.

## Map highlights

The o!bwc teams have brought an incredible variety of maps to the community. And who better to share the stories behind these creations than the teams themselves? Let's hear from them about the inspirations and challenges behind these amazing maps throughout the contest!

### [BilliumMoto & Miyolophone - IX's Shadow](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402714) by ::{ flag=TW }:: Team Taiwan (Round of 16)

> From the qualifiers up to now, we've maintained a style that's distinct from other countries. We've stuck to showing the song's character through the map itself instead of doing anything too flashy — and judging by the results, it worked.
> 
> This time, since the song is a uniquely styled IDM track, we all agreed that the CS5 AR9 setup fit perfectly, and we incorporated a lot of stylistic variation. For example, in the quieter sections we used some weird slider shapes, then switched to more angular ones as the orchestral part kicked in, and finally went all-out with a wild style during the chorus explosion.
> 
> We also hid a bunch of references — like a sudden Megalovania moment and the meme sound of THE ROCK. So of course, we added Sans from Undertale and the iconic THE ROCK slider. Huge thanks to the teammates for their amazing ideas!
> 
> Lastly, I want to thank my incredible teammates — I had a great time working on this. Without you all, Taiwan wouldn't have achieved such an outstanding result.

### [Ice - Conclusio Catastropha (Game Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2425045) by ::{ flag=KR }:: Team South Korea (Semifinal)

</div>

> The map we'd like to talk about is Ice - Conclusio Catastropha (Game Ver.). Going into the semi-finals, we saw Team Taiwan as absolute titans. Acylica was like a broken record, always repeating, "How do we even beat Taiwan?" Honestly, for our team, the semi-finals were our real finals. That was the round where we left everything on the table.
> 
> To face them, we needed a secret weapon — something completely unexpected. That's how we landed on the crazy idea of making our own Vocaloid cover from scratch. As you can imagine, a lot of the team was against it. We weren't professional composers, and we were on a serious time crunch. But Acylica was so passionate and convincing that we all got on board. The guy even bought the pretty pricey IA2 Vocaloid software just to make it happen. What a legend.
> 
> Of course, the lyrics also went through several rewrites, requiring a lot of effort. On the mapping side, it was a brutal grind. Pulling off a map of this level in only two weeks is a monumental challenge — the intro alone took us a solid two to three days. Getting even four hours of sleep a night felt like a lot. I think I was averaging about two and a half hours of sleep a night during that two-week stretch, lol. But it was all worth it. Team Taiwan was an incredible opponent, and they pushed us to our absolute limits. Thanks again for an amazing and unforgettable match.

### [Kurubukko - Hometown in Ruins](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424914) by ::{ flag=US }:: Team United States (Semifinal)

</div>

> Going into the semifinals, we knew we had to step up our mapping if we wanted to advance. Our initial decision was to use a top/bottom playfield gimmick, since we hadn't seen much of that in the competition, and the straightforward song name also gave us the idea to use themed sliders. Our first tests were on crumbling house sliders, but they felt weak on their own, so we added growing and wilting flowers and fleshed out other ideas. Once we had phyr's butterfly stream, it started to come together — since we weren't just mapping the "town" in ruins, but also the environment.
> 
> In the last kiai, the map ends with a storm or barrage of sliders raining down the screen to represent the cause of the "ruins" which ties things up very nicely. This may have been our most ambitious map in the competition, but I think we're all satisfied with the ideas and concepts we were able to execute given the tight deadline.

### [Aoi - azure iris](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2414105) by ::{ flag=FR }:: Team France (Quarterfinal)

</div>

> Hi, [Blacky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11540165) here! My team and I often work by theme, where the reflection period can take three days or even a week. Since Azure Iris has a double meaning — the pupil of the eye and the flower — we combined these themes with the very mechanical and destructive side of the music by adding "tumors" on our sliders, like petals (or gears) coming out of them.
> 
> For the second part of the music, we preferred to make a much simpler and more fluid mapping with a lot of kick sliders, as well as a multitude of symmetrical patterns, because the melody of the music becomes clearer here — and this is the key passage of the track.
> 
> As for the ending part, which was created by Timevid, it builds on the same concept as before, but with an additional connection between elements: all the slider art is centered in the middle, like the center of an eye.
> 
> This map was, for us, the best we made among all our entries, because the whole team was able to spend much more free time on it. We were also quite inspired when finding the main theme, concepts, and so on. And I want to thank Pyo for her generosity and responsiveness in creating all of our animated banners for each of our entry descriptions.
