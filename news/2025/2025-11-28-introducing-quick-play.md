Leaves fall rather quickly in the autumn, yet none of them will be as quick as osu!'s brand new matchmaking system!

![](REMEMBER_TO_ADD_BANNER)

The demand to add matchmaking to the game has not gone unnoticed. Rising popularity on some community solutions such as auto-hosting bots and full on external matchmaking services have only reinforced this idea.

As of two weeks ago, however, osu! officially introduced its own version of matchmaking appropriately called [quick play](/wiki/Gameplay/Quick_play) (name pending)!

We hope you'll join us this coming November 29th in a stress-test with the addition of over 120 new maps (including mods) to the pool, global rating leaderboards, randomised voting, and more. Of course, the team will also be participating!

## But what exactly is quick play?

For those who still haven't checked the official update video, here's a quick rundown of what quick play is by the hands of [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) and [smoogipoo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1040328) — the minds behind quick play as a whole!

Quick play is an attempt at branching out into more ways for players to play and compete in the game. As opposed to leaderboards and [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) which allow players to compete in a global environment, quick play offers a much more direct approach to competition by facing players against each other to test their mettle! In turn, quick play allows players to measure their skill relatively to their peers, as well as providing a much more direct way to interact with the community — not to dissimilar how multiplayer lobbies work.

The name of the game lies in its name: *quick* play! The system aims to provide a very casual experience for players who just want to hop into a lobby and get into the nitty-gritty of things. No need to create a lobby, wait for players to join, wait for everyone to ready up, and manually rotate the host between players. Users will be able to get the same experience at a much quicker and steady pace from a selection of pre-curated mappools across all game modes!

For those looking into more specific details, please check out the [wiki article](/wiki/Gameplay/Quick_play) to know more about the project's inner workings.

## Quick play launch event

In an attempt to get the word out and to get more players to try out the system, the team has planned weekly test runs for the next four weeks. These runs will allow players to test quick play under different environments, allowing the team to gather user feedback and make adjustments towards the version that players like the most!

The current schedule alongside the different environments is as follows:

| Dates | Pool type | Matchmaking type |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| November 29th – December 6th | Manually curated | 1v1 |
| December 6th – December 13th | Manually curated | FFA |
| December 13th – December 20th | Randomised | 1v1 |
| December 20th – December 27th | Randomised | FFA |

While the manually curated pools are an expansion of the existing pools players have been able to play so far, the team wants to experiment with pseudo-randomised pools that would be created on the fly based on a lobby's average MMR. Additionally, we want to experiment with different lobby sizes to see how players react towards different competitive environments.

The evolution of this system rests in your hands! While it's still in its early stages, the team is actively reading your feedback and trying to figure out works and what doesn't.

We want to extend our thanks to all users who have made this possible. From the developers tasked with implementing the system from scratch, to the community members who were willing to test and offer feedback, as well as the users behind the first mappools used to try the system out.

For those who are willing to provide feedback, you'll be able to find a dedicated [channel](https://discord.com/channels/188630481301012481/1440912440224120882) in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) as well as a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/ppy/osu/discussions/35506) in the osu! repository.

Stay tuned for more announcements, change-logs, and news about the system in the coming weeks.
