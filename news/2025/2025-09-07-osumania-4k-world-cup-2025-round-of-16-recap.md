The first elimination round comes to a close with a bang! The bells toll as half of the teams survive the cull.

With such a strong start to the tournament, it was to be expected this momentum would carry into the next rounds. Little did we know teams in both losers' and winners' brackets would be thriving in such an early round, whether it be due to the the pressure brought by the looming fear of being eliminated, or the need to maintain the lead up until Grand Finals.

![Round of 16 mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-round-of-16-recap/mappool-ro16.jpg)

With the Round of 32 far behind us, the Round of 16 made its glorious entrance last week with one hell of a pool! The slot structure is no different than last round's, consisting of the same amount of maps in each category. There isn't much else to point out besides the fact that the pools are harder — predictably so.

Why not start things off with the very first slot of the pool? [Ali Tabatabaee & Matty Lewis - HIS WORLD \~THEME OF SONIC THE HEDGEHOG\~ (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424884#mania/5278251) (RC1) by ::{ flag=US }:: [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [Hylotl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18270260) is a very unique, yet effective speed/stream pick. It is categorised by its very distinct split between a technical approach on the verses and a more straightforward chorus with consistent streams. The end result is nothing short of enjoyable, in no small part thanks to the song choice itself!

Perhaps the most... *interesting* pick of the pool was [Sasuke Haraguchi feat. Kasane Teto - Igaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2425008#mania/5278526) (HB3) by ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), an extremely interesting twist on a song you'd never expect. Being by far the most technical and "gracey" pick in the pool, it ended up sticking out like a sore thumb — in a good way, that is, since the approach works shockingly well. It's just one of those things that's... very hard to describe. The most you can really do here is try it yourself, and understand just how unconventional this chart actually is.

A good ending point would be [xi - Aragami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2425007#mania/5278525) (LN2) by ::{ flag=US }:: [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093). For a density slot, it ended up breaking the typical ideology you'd see from previous rounds (and years), with the length being what is possibly the biggest noticeable change for its slot. The dense sections are much, much shorter, but this is made up for by the proportionately trickier patterns, leading to players finding chokes or accuracy drops in the spots they'd least expect them. Despite the change in length, these small choke points could be the sole reason for a pick to be lost.

Another round, another [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music)! This time around, [KASHIWA Daisuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/343) is making their (osu!)debut with [SHARAKU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424991#mania/5278496) (RC6) — charted by [0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707) — in a very similar fashion to the previous round! There's a high likelihood you've heard this name before, as long as [Aqua Regia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1378372#mania/2854566) by [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707) and [Elekton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4990211) is a chart you've played or seen before. This chart maintains a similar structure, with heavy bursts alongside frequent jacks, with very tight graces on top of all that. This beatmap, in combination with the incredible graphic design by [Panthullu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298), is sure to grab the attention of many osu!mania players, perhaps even players from other game modes!

Despite a very challenging mappool, players and teams were able to show outstanding performances all across the board. It's very clear that as mappools get harder, players will continue to increase their skill level, showing how well they are able to adapt as the bar continues to rise.

- ::{ flag=ID }:: [Reyi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13385865) has shown pristine consistency, best exemplified by his 997,721 score on [Ali Tabatabaee & Matty Lewis - HIS WORLD \~THEME OF SONIC THE HEDGEHOG\~ (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424884#mania/5278251) (RC1) by ::{ flag=US }:: [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [Hylotl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18270260). Despite the numerous speed patterns that were present all throughout the chart, he was able to accurately play at such speeds while keeping up with the song's tempo. In no small part, this helped Indonesia reign over their German rivals.
- Despite being a rising star both the osu!mania 4K World Cup and community at large, thanks to ::{ flag=RU }:: [Dystire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11585213)'s impressive 995,131 score on [seatrus - V!rtuaresort](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424995#mania/5278502) (HB2) by ::{ flag=US }:: [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811) the Russian Federation was able to win a crucial point in their match against the Canadian team. While this did not secure victory for the Russians, this player's LN and HB prowess was something their rivals had to be concerned with throughout the entire match.
- Long note accuracy has always been one of the most difficult skill sets to master, yet ::{ flag=KR }:: [Poca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8581031) makes it seem like a piece of cake. Their 997,515 score on [Yorushika - Hachigatsu, Bou, Tsukiakari (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424998#mania/5278505) (LN1) by ::{ flag=PH }:: [Hytex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8536263) and ::{ flag=AU }:: [fvrex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11863699) just shows how even up to this day, they remain as one of the most impressive long note players this game has ever had the pleasure to witness.
- Finally, ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) wowed us all again with his mastery of the game. His score on [goreshit - still all scared of ouija boards (edit ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2424752#mania/5277926) (RC2) by ::{ flag=KR }:: [11Bit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14804526) outshined everyone in the tournament, utterly destroying the leaderboards in the process. He also had some of the most absurd ratios throughout the entire round, if not the best ones.

While these snippets alone were impressive enough to warrant a shoutout, one match in particular stood out from the rest.

### ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand vs. ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam

::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand and ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam, two very familiar faces, had the pleasure to face each other off during the Round of 16. Despite ::{ flag=TH }:: [parponger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28098890)'s absence, this was soon to be one of the most exciting matches of the week, maybe even of the tournament thus far! Vietnam could not afford to make any mistakes either. In spite of their arguably more balanced roster, their less-than-stable consistency was soon to be tested.

As it has grown to be customary, the protect and ban process clearly showed which skill sets favoured which team. Thailand's team leaned towards rice, whereas Vietnam was going to thrive on long note picks. This was quickly followed up by Vietnam's first pick, LN2. Even though ::{ flag=VN }:: [TriDoanGaming](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14009758) landed an early miss, they were able to maintain a close gap by holding their ratio high. By the second half, however, ::{ flag=TH }:: [MatchaLatte-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15944956) had an unfortunate miss, which evened out the score. After a nerve-wracking last spurt, Vietnam managed to squeeze in their first win by a meagre **344 points**. Funnily enough, this was not going to be the closest win of the match.

The match went on somewhat as predicted. Thailand opted to play rice picks, with ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) and ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) doing a hell of a good job! Unfortunately, Vietnam was on a roll that day, and with the scoreboard at 3–4 in favour of Vietnam, Thailand was forced to pick their rival's pick on a match point. While they had home field advantage, Vietnam was not going to let their chance be squandered.

While Thailand's ratio was monstrous all throughout the final chart, against all odds, ::{ flag=TH }:: [achi77](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24026784)'s unfortunate miss was just enough to give Vietnam the smallest of leads, giving them the last point they oh-so-needed to close the match. How small of a lead are we talking about? **116 points!**

Despite the early upset for Thailand, their performance during the match defied everyone's initial expectations. Given that the full roster will be available in the coming rounds, we can only hope they make a strong comeback in the losers' bracket. Congratulations to Vietnam, who remains undefeated for another round, giving them a well-deserved morale boost and extra wiggle room... *for now*.

## Score highlights

As previously mentioned, the score difference on the very last map between Thailand and Vietnam was only 116 points, but that wasn't the only match that had close calls. Actually, many matches saw teams narrowly escaping a loss, with maps getting decided almost purely by ratios. In some cases, a single 100 could have been enough to tip the scales on these maps. Please take a look at the top 10 closest scores of this round:

If there's something to be learnt from this round is that a win is a win, no matter how small the margin may be. The fact that matches can be decided by a single bit going up or down is mental. Despite how dreadful the thought of losing a match by a singular digit is, with players as seasoned as these we find it hard to believe it will ever happen again... right?

We hope to see you soon on next week's recap, but until then, give the actual streams at [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) or [osulive_2](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive_2) a watch. Moreover, any and all information not covered by the recap can be found in the [wiki](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_4k), so give it a read whenever you can!
