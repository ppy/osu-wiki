You've reached the end of the line. A new realm of music is here.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/470/header.jpg)

**Terminal 11** is a longstanding icon in the experimental music field, producing avant-garde tunes since 1999. With a sound perfectly catering to osu!taiko and osu!mania players seeking the maximalist rhythmic complexity, **Terminal 11** has become a staple of the Loved category in both modes.

**8** unorthodox tracks have made their way to [**Terminal 11**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/470). Given your mapping input, they'll make their way to the Ranked beatmap listing too.

Take a peek:

### [Terminal 11 - Echoes](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/470/Echoes/Terminal%2011%20-%20Echoes.osz)

This year's osu!taiko World Cup gave some love to **Terminal 11** too! Earlier today, [Echoes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354615) (mapped by [Xay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/961417)) was showcased as part of the Finals mappool!

Sometimes we perform actions without thinking — actions like visiting [**Terminal 11**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/470), looking through all of his available songs, making a full beatmap spread for one of them, talking to Beatmap Nominators, then getting a map Ranked. Totally uncontrollable. We'll forgive you if you do it though.

Next weekend is a big day for people who like sounds in their ears: we'll be announcing another Featured Artist!

Stay tuned.
