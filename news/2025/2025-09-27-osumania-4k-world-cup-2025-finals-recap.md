The final bout is near! Heavy is the crown to burden a king, but heavier is the path to the MWC 4K throne.

For many, this is most likely the most important and exciting stage of the tournament. It is the very last challenge players have to overcome before reaching the podium. The very last spurt that can make or break a team's chance of winning the tournament. Most importantly, it acts as a final test of a team's combined skills under the most challenging pools to date — only for them to get even harder right afterwards!

From our preliminary observations, this has perhaps been one of the most — if not the most — entertaining round of the whole tournament, to the point we were close to highlight all matches! No surprise there given that only the best of the best teams remained in the bracket.

But for those looking forward to *all* matches, including some extra goodies like an interview to team China, please check out this week's video recap, courtesy of [Dynascape](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8784587), [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), and [akace100](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9308128).

![Finals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-27-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-finals-recap/mappool-f.jpg)

Despite being only one round away from the hardest charts MWC has to offer, the Finals mappool is nothing short of challenging. For the last time, the pool itself expands with the addition of two new slots, RC8 and HB4, leading to a total chart count of 17. They're, as expected, made to have as little overlap as possible with the other existing slots, offering more options without sacrificing variety. With the introduction out of the way, shall we get into the highlights?

The first slot, and possibly the most unique set we've ever seen in this slot, is [black midi - Sugar/Tzu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435325#mania/5308401) (RC1) by ::{ flag=GB }:: [Pope Gadget](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341). Typically, this slot would contain a chart that's around two minutes long, yet this breaks that pattern by being a whole three minutes and thirty seconds long! While there's a break in between to make up for the length, the relentless streams made the overall experience feel much, much more sustained. Not to mention the unique song choice with unorthodox BPM changes.

Next up is [Susumu Hirasawa - BERSERK -Forces- (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435333#mania/5308423) (RC4) by ::{ flag=CA }:: [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065). Played at a whopping 1.3x rate, this chart has a really neat approach to the song, with the chordjacks almost taking a vocal dump approach. Outside the vocal sections, there's some 1/6 and 1/8 bursts mixed between certain jacks. Despite the BPM sounding rather tame at 156, you should not take it for granted, as the general density of the jacks more than makes up for it. This is especially noticeable when compared to previous years' chordjack picks.

Rounding things off, we'll end the highlights with [Camellia - shadows of cats (cut ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435368#mania/5308483) (HB2) by ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) and ::{ flag=MY }:: [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723). If you're at all familiar with how HB2 is structured, it's always much more minijack-y and shield-heavy as opposed to other hybrids. This, while being no exception, escalates it by utilising a substantial amount of longjacks. We're talking longjacks of four to five notes, which are extremely easy to choke on at 183 BPM. All of this isn't even mentioning the general shield-heavy patterns scattered throughout, most notably in the kiais, keeping players on their toes as they try to avoid misses at all costs.

## Finals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| United Kingdom ::{ flag=GB }:: | 3 | **7** | ::{ flag=KR }:: **South Korea** |
| China ::{ flag=CN }:: | 6 | **7** | ::{ flag=US }:: **United States** |
| Chile ::{ flag=CL }:: | 3 | **7** | ::{ flag=TH }:: **Thailand** |
| Thailand ::{ flag=TH }:: | 3 | **7** | ::{ flag=KR }:: **South Korea** |

We briefly spoiled it during this post's introduction, but this is by far, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most exciting stages we've had throughout the entire tournament. Arguably one that will go down the annals of MWC history given the stakes and quality of the matches.

Our expectations were high, and most users were already aware of the teams' potential. Even with all of those preconceived notions in mind, no one was expecting many of the events that occurred during these Finals, particularly during China's match against the United States.

Speaking of which...

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

It was a late 11 PM for China, and as early as 8 AM for some of the American players. This resulted in the absence of all-star player ::{ flag=CN }:: [DawnX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8534840) and rice master ::{ flag=US }:: [\_dev\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16407268), but both the United States, untouchable champions since last year, and China, unexpectedly topping the Qualifiers with a newly formed roster, were not going to let that burden them.

China had the first pick, and they went with VTuber vocal dump map [Hoshimachi Suisei - Wicked feat. Mori Calliope](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2252923#mania/5308048) (RC6). The Americans quickly took an accuracy lead, but after some traded misses, and missing some more... the lead swung over to the Chinese side. This opportunity was not permitted to slip by, and China retained a 10k point lead up until the end of the map, stealing the *first* point from the United States in this whole tournament. This was a good start for the Chinese team, and an omen for what was to come.

The United States displayed a terrific show of accuracy, but the Chinese side had the favour on consistency — a recurring theme throughout the match. This was made obvious in the United States' next two counter picks, [seatrus - ILLEGAL LEGACY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1749442#mania/5308481) (HB4) and [Lon - Yuru Fuwa Jukai Girl](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435361#mania/5308470) (LN2), showing off unreal accuracy that clutched up the points in the final moments of both picks. China, meanwhile, won their own two picks as well: first with 10k points on [Pendulum - The Island - Pt. II](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1753543#mania/3602081) (RC5) very similarly to the first pick, then with an unexpectedly close [cYsmix - Abandoned Shrine Party](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435303#mania/5308360) (RC7) that saw their initial lead evaporate as the scoreline flickered in the last seconds of the map (but ultimately clutching victory with **462 points!**).

Both teams continued trading blows left and right. It is worth pointing out that both teams' strengths were at full display during most picks, with players like ::{ flag=CN }:: [WOEM2436](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/36120676) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [[GB]ParasolTree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27552902) powering through most picks with ungodly consistency, whereas ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) remained the one and only accuracy GOAT all throughout the match, showing off their impressive ratios one after another regardless of the map they were playing.

Eventually, the match evened out at 4–4. China was starting to run out of picks that would favour them, so in an unexpected turn of events they opted to pivot towards something more technical such as with [onumi - Spider Tank](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1551057#mania/3589489) (HB3) to catch the Americans off-guard. Things didn't turn out that well for them, however, as the United States scored a double full combo by the hands of ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) and ::{ flag=US }:: [Hello_Son](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17308009). Losing a break point at this stage of the match was not ideal. With that in mind, as the United States picked [Saitama Saisyu Heiki - Surface Tension](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435344#mania/5308441) (RC3), China, for lack of a better word, locked in and scored a triple FC thanks to ::{ flag=CN }:: [WOEM2436](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/36120676), ::{ flag=CN }:: [[GB]ParasolTree](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27552902), and ::{ flag=CN }:: [Idontknowwhathi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32379983)'s amazing performance!

The stalemate continued up until both teams were forced to play this round's tiebreaker. Nerves and fatigue were at an all-time high, at this point past midnight for the Chinese, as the referee brought the last map into the lobby. 800 viewers in the twitch stream, and reportedly a similar amount in the bilibili equivalent were watching in expectation of the final showdown of this epic match, the 6-minute multi-mapper collaboration [Kou! - Fermion Amplification](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435372#mania/5308489). This is only the *second* tiebreaker of this whole tournament, the first happening back in the [Round of 32](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-08-30-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-round-of-32-recap)

The last map proved to be as close as the rest of the match, with leads staying within 2k points for most of its runtime. The United States held that lead for the first half of the map, before numerous misses caused it to sway between the mostly evenly matched teams. As the second half of the map picked up steam, a couple untraded Chinese misses gave the Americans a lead that grew to 7k points, now 80% through the map. In this crucial moment, however, ::{ flag=US }:: [Minwoo3098](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18356454) missed once, losing 2k... then again, losing 2k... and yet again, dropping to a 1k lead. This was *just* before the outro of the tiebreaker... but with ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) still holding strong, about to close a 1xMiss 993k play, it was already too late for China to fully bring it back. As the final calm notes brought a halt to the dwindling lead, the United States still remained on the side of victory by a meagre 1,208 points.

### ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand vs. ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea

Coming in hot from defeating strong opponents, ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand and ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea clashed during the second round in the losers' bracket. Both teams were one step shy from reaching top 3, so this was definitely going to be one of their most important matches. Given that both teams were fairly well-rounded as proven by their previous matches, this was shaping up to be a very interesting match!

Despite their good track record with rice maps, both teams opted to ban maps from such slots. With that oddity out of the way, South Korea started strong by picking their protect [onumi - Spider Tank](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1551057#mania/3589489) (HB3). While it was not a pick that statistically favoured the Koreans, it ended up with a nice and easy first win for the team. Thailand responded in kind by also choosing their protect [cYsmix - Abandoned Shrine Party](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435303#mania/5308360) (RC7). Much to be expected, they proved why this was their protect, with ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) and ::{ flag=TH }:: [parponger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28098890) scoring a crazy double SS.

South Korea kept up with their strategy by picking [seatrus - ILLEGAL LEGACY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1749442#mania/5308481) (HB4). Unfortunately for them, unfortunate mishaps from ::{ flag=KR }:: [Scitra](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26140861) at the end gave Thailand the advantage they needed, taking this match's first break point. This would then be followed up by [black midi - Sugar/Tzu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435325#mania/5308399) (RC1), which was swiftly taken back by South Korea after ::{ flag=KR }:: [ggeexx1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17494164) and ::{ flag=KR }:: [Naaaad](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10344857)'s triple full combo!

Third time is the charm, as they say. That's why South Korea picked yet another hybrid map, [Camellia - shadows of cats (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435368#mania/5308483) (HB2). While the map is notoriously hard to keep combo in, both teams continued to drop with an ever-so-unstable lead, with South Korea snatching back an extra point. Keeping up the Camellia-core trend, Thailand didn't stick with rice but instead chose [Camellia - Kisaragi (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2377732#mania/5308488) (LN4), getting the match into into another 3–3 tie without much issue thanks to their consistency.

As the match looked to be heading into a tiebreaker given the continuous back and forth, this was going to be the very last point Thailand would be able to steal from their rivals. However, South Korea was able to keep up their momentum from then on and swipe point after point from the hands of the Thai team, eventually taking the victory. This was not to say it wasn't a close match either way, as Thailand gave them one hell of a fight on maps like [Kobaryo - Villain Virus [feat. Camellia]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2435350#mania/5308454) (HB1) with ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267)'s spotlight 995k performance.

With the match ending at 3–7, South Korea was able to return to the podium after a year. But they won't stop there! Having won the Friday match against ::{ flag=CN }:: China to start off the Grand Finals, they're still in it to battle the undefeated champions of the tournament: the ::{ flag=US }:: United States!

---

This is it folks! Our second to last recap is over, which means we'll be recapping the final results very, very soon. We hope you'll also be there as we spectate the very last skirmish between the ::{ flag=US }:: United States and ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea this Sunday at 05:00 UTC on [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive)!
