Can you really claim you've listened to music until you've heard our new Featured Artist **Akts**?

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/513/header.jpg)

Chilean producer **Akts** has been at it for over 10 years, offering their specific style of Vocaloid-infused tunes spanning across the electronic spectrum. While countless genres and artists had an impact on **Akts**'s music, listeners might notice bits and pieces of *Crystal Castles* and *Skrillex* spread throughout **Akts**'s tracks.

Those tracks (**10** to be specific!) can be found on [**Akts**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/513) in the form of pre-timed `.osz`s. Nobody said mapping would be easy, but that's one less step at least.

Without further ado, the music:

Only 10% of an iceberg is visible above the water. The same applies to **Akts**'s music: a fraction of the available songs are on this news post, while the rest of the berg is down in [**Akts**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/513).

Keen observers may have noticed that we sometimes announce new Featured Artists on World Cup livestreams during mappool showcases. And... we'll leave it at that.

See you in a week.
