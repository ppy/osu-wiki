The [cavoe's osu! event's Global Taiko Showdown](https://gratiaproductions.com/coegts/home) (COEGTS) showcased its strengths in providing some of the most interesting osu!taiko tournament action back in 2023. While being the first time the GTS series delved into the LAN scene, COEGTS also stands to this day as the only tournament in the game with, truly, **100% original content**.

So, there is no better way to end GTS than with this tournament.

Regarding the tournament's bracket format, there is a slight change from the past year. This is planned to be a **single-elimination bracket** of **8 players** that will be in the tournament following the online Qualifiers. Due to the nature of the songs in this mappool (they're fully original creations), matches will be livestreamed right from the get-go.

As a special event as well this year, the **Qualifier results** will be showcased at COE itself, along with the **main mappool showcase**.

This tournament is planned to **be badged**, with additional physical prizes planned. They will be announced at a later date, but the first one that can be revealed: **The winner of this tournament will win a Wooting 80HE!**

The tournament's detailed schedule and location info, along with all relevant info for participating can be found below.
