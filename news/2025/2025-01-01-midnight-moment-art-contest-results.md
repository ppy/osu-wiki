### peppy's picks

The year may have come to an end, but some traditions never do. We present to you [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2)'s personal favourites that will be joining the top-voted entries on the main menu:

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/banners/JlNN.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/winners/JlNN.png)

[**JlNN**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22499692)'s pippi and Chirou approached the New Year celebrations in a way some might consider obvious, yet possibly uncommon: you should be sleeping by midnight.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/banners/SNOWCATO.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/winners/SNOWCATO.png)

[**SNOWCATO**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28373925)'s DJ pippi kept the party for our osu! friends in a mood just right for the special night.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/banners/Christi_Anna.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/winners/Christi_Anna.png)

[**Christi_Anna**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11016739) invited the *entire* osu! cast to celebrate the fancy festivities, alongside a special feline guest making a cameo too.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/banners/AyoLie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/winners/AyoLie.png)

pippi and Mocha are often depicted as perhaps slightly more than friends in these art contests. According to [**AyoLie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29186645), maybe 2025 will change that perception ever so slightly.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/banners/Raybean.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/winners/Raybean.png)

[**Raybean**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16676388) interpreted the New Year's fireworks as the vibrant barrage of colours they should be, and who would ever take that vision away?

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/banners/Ka1mon_.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/226/winners/Ka1mon_.PNG)

[**Ka1mon_**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34939444)'s simple take on the quintessential annual midnight moment lit up pippi and Mocha's wistful visages with veritable wonder.
