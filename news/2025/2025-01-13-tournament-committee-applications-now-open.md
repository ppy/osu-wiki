We are seeking passionate individuals with significant tournament experience — including players — to help support and improve the community.

## Requirements

To join the TC, you must meet the following minimum criteria:

- You must be at least 18 years of age.
- All applicants are checked for any notable community rule violations within the last 12 months, which would disqualify them from joining.
- Fluency in English is mandatory, as most reviewed content and all communications are in English.

## Who should apply?

We're looking for individuals who are:

- Passionate about osu! tournaments
- Team players
- Exceptional communicators
- Organised and reliable

## Standout qualities (bonus points!)

We are particularly interested in candidates who:
