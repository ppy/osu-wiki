Some osu! players click circles, some osu! players create circles to be clicked, and some osu! players like **Xeon Diversity** create music for the rest of the circle-clicking chain.

**Xeon Diversity** took on a new hobby in the height of the COVID-19 lockdown: producing music. Their career began from playing rhythm games throughout their younger years (including osu!, of course), taking notes from artists like [*Synthion*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/357), [*Aice Room*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/360), [*Mitsukiyo*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/292), and *Snail's House*, eventually inspiring their own wave of aural creations.

It's official: **12** tracks are pre-timed and available on [**Xeon Diversity**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/499). If you're keen on mapping, pick out a song and download its `.osz` already.

Experience some diversity through these track previews:

### [Xeon Diversity - Luminaire](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/499/Genesis%20EP/Xeon%20Diversity%20-%20Luminaire.osz)

Wandering around [COE 2025](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event) sheds light on how most osu! players enjoy the game. [Ryshult](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11189164) was an outlier though, as evidenced by this play on [coco](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9579526)'s [map of Luminaire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2353640) with the [Easy mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Easy)!

The first thing on your mind should be whether or not your favourite **Xeon Diversity** song is on [their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/499). The second thing on your mind should be when you should start mapping. We don't need to tell you the answer.

We suspect it'll take at least a week for you to create your mapping vision in the editor. Once that's done, come back here to witness another Featured Artist announcement!

Stay tuned.
