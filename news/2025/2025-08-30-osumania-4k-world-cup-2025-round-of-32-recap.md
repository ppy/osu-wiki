![Round of 32 mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-08-30-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-round-of-32-recap/mappool-ro32.jpg)

With Qualifiers coming to a close, we've finally reached our first round (of 32). Taking a different approach from the 7-stage structure from the Qualifiers, we've got our hands on the first full pool of the tournament with 6 rice slots, 3 hybrid slots, 3 long note slots, and one tiebreaker. With that said, here are some of the most notable highlights from the round!

The best way to start things off is with [Taishi - Distant Relatives (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421252#mania/5267303) (HB3) by ::{ flag=DZ }:: [Scotty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11085809) and ::{ flag=HK }:: [Alptraum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26496648)! With the removal of SV, Round of 32 started with three hybrid picks instead of two. And as it is to be expected, HB3 had the most difficult patterning out of all three. With the slot always having a technical focus, you can be sure to expect many dump-heavy patterns, intertwining both rice and long note patterns in a rather seamless manner.

In the rice category, a great highlight would be [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421243#mania/5267288) (RC3) by ::{ flag=DE }:: [ababa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8599070). Given the fact this is the earliest we've seen a chordjack slot being introduced in, the approach it took to balance the chart was rather unique. While its difficulty progression goes hand-in-hand with the song's, the chordjacks themselves came in denser bursts with breaks in between, putting more emphasis on the players' control over the map's shifts in patterning rather than being the consistency gauntlet this slot is commonly known for.

Just like with HB3, Round of 32 also introduced the chordjack slot a round earlier than usual. For an introduction to early-game chordjacks, the approach this chart had was rather unique, but ended up working very well, with the jacks being heavily focused on the vocals of the song. In turn, this resulted in a steady progression of difficulty as the intensity of the vocals increased.

To wrap things up, [Three - Kuuchuu Bunkai (Long Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421253#mania/5267304) (LN1) by ::{ flag=AU }:: [fvrex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11863699) and ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) felt like a good ending point to this round's map highlights. Consisting of 200 BPM staggered releases, short streams, and slight 1/3 bursts, it served as a solid introduction to what the long note coordination slot had to offer. Despite the simple patterns, this map has *without question* brought a great deal of pain to the players' accuracies. Spoiler alert: maps on this slot won't be any easier as we move into later rounds!

First round in, and we've already got an [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music)? That's right! [muyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/491) made their first appearance in osu! with ['Oumuamua](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421220#mania/5267227) (HB2) charted by ::{ flag=US }:: [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093)! As expected of the HB2 slot, this chart is heavy on the shield and burst usage, which ended up highly benefitting from the electronic-jazz vibes that the song gives off, especially alongside the illustration and graphic design by ::{ flag=PH }:: [Creameries](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15851364) and ::{ flag=MY }:: [Z419](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966)! Even if the chart may be too tricky for you, it is certainly worth giving this interstellar song a listen.

As we briefly spoiled in the post's introduction, this has been anything but a normal beginning to the tournament. A mix of both unforeseen circumstances and some of the underdogs locking in has made this Round of 32 quite a peculiar one, all things considered.

While our top teams have had no issues throughout the round, the closer we got to the middle seeds, the more interesting this week's matches have been!

We can only hope that the following few highlights are proof of it.

### ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland

Placing 16th and 17th on the Qualifiers respectively, Malaysia vs. Poland was expected to be one of the closest matches during the past weekend — and it certainly did not disappoint! Despite the absence of ::{ flag=PL }:: [bagjettka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18338179), the Polish gave Malaysia quite a run for their money.

With Malaysia protecting LN2 ([Minato Aqua - Mada, Aoi (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421032#mania/5278676)), and Poland protecting RC5 ([ZUTOMAYO - Kan Saete Kuyashiiwa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421245#mania/5267290)), both teams set the stage for what kind of charts they were leaning towards: Malaysia going for the long note and hybrid picks, while Poland going for the rices. This was further established after Malaysia banned RC1 ([sana & Nayugorou - Love Potion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421240#mania/5267282)), and Poland banning LN3 ([*wakadori - NightTheater](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421059#mania/5266881)). From here, we can see that from a physicality standpoint, Poland had a slight upper hand. Malaysia, fully cognizant of that fact, played their cards closer to their chest by focusing on long note oriented picks thanks to their far more established LN skills. And this is what ultimately forced Poland to ban [NightTheater](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421059#mania/5266881).

The first four picks were considerably close, starting the match off with Malaysia's stellar performance on their own protect (LN2) while Poland responded back with an amazing performance of their own on RC2. This was followed by Malaysia having a very comfortable win on LN1, [Three - Kuuchuu Bunkai (Long Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421253#mania/5267304), and a nail-biting win for Poland on RC3, [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421243#mania/5267288). Chordjacks tend to be charts that can quickly shift the lead with only one mistake, which is fair given that players tend to have the highest ratio on these picks. All throughout the chart, the lead kept switching back and forth, until a 200 and a few bad judgments on Malaysia's side gave a slight edge to Poland, even with Poland dropping a miss in the very last seconds.

In the end, the match was decided on the tiebreaker, [Yooh - Eternity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421270#mania/5267331). While both teams proved to be forces to be reckoned with, Malaysia's better all-round performance gave them the edge on a map as multi-faceted as this one, ultimately taking the match.

### ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines vs. ::{ flag=FR }:: France

Glancing at the Qualifier results, the Philippines seemed to have the advantage in this match, seeded at #14 vs. France's #19. Pick'ems agreed, with 96% of people predicting them as victors — but reality is not often what it seems. With seasoned tournament players on the two rosters, no one was going to make this an easy match.

Both teams protected rice maps, and rice is where the match started, with the highly technical [Dz'Xa - Cosmic Crisis (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421249#mania/5267295) (RC6) resulting in a 6-way FC and a narrow 3k victory for the Philippines (wow!). A similar situation developed in the second pick, the jumpstream consistency [seatrus - Heavens Station](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421022#mania/5266791) (RC2). But then, disaster struck: ::{ flag=PH }:: [lyvet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18121419)'s unfortunate disconnect resulted in 5 FCs and France's first win.

Amazingly, not a single miss was dropped in the 3rd map (LN1) either, and it was only in the match's 4th pick, [sana & Nayugorou - Love Potion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421240#mania/5267282) (RC1) which France protected, where a couple of misses on the Filipino side gave the point to their opponents. The consistency of these players is truly something to behold!

The match now stood at 2–2. The next pick was [*wakadori - NightTheater](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421059#mania/5266881) (LN3), where lower accuracy with 3 full combos proved to be the key for the first break point of the match, giving France a lead. Fun fact: [NightTheater](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421059#mania/5266881) was played in 4 matches, with France and the Philippines holding the #1 and #2 spots in the team score leaderboard! But the lead would not last: the Philippines' rice ratio trio of ::{ flag=PH }:: [Velyria](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9423922), ::{ flag=PH }:: [Vulpsi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12584420), and ::{ flag=PH }:: [lyvet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18121419) locked gears, with an incredible back-to-back performance on the FFR Tech pick [Terminal 11 - Cold Storage (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421224#mania/5267239) (RC4) and the chordjack pick [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421243#mania/5267288) (RC3), putting them at match point.

France, now nearing the edge, picked the technical hybrid [Taishi - Distant Relatives](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421252#mania/5267303) (HB3), a Taishi epic that, even with ::{ flag=FR }:: [DarkMew2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13921965)'s MVP performance, was not enough to overcome the Philippines' minuscule great count, ending the match with a 3.7k point difference.

Fun fact: every single pick in this match was decided by less than 8,000 points! A testament to consistency and these players' performance. The Philippines will continue in the winners' bracket facing South Korea, and France will fight Finland in the lower bracket to stay in the tournament. Good luck to both teams!

### ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil vs. ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru

As if it were destined to be, Brazil and Peru faced off on the very first round of the tournament! The two South American teams, placing #13 and #20 during Qualifiers respectively, were not only close in location but also in skill. With both teams favouring rice maps over everything else, this match quickly became quite the tricky one, and it all started with their picks and bans.

Unsurprisingly, both teams started off by protecting their favourite rice picks while banning anything with even just a single long note in it. Liking noodles is, after all, an acquired taste. This rice-dominant match was soon demonstrated by Peru's very first pick, [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421243#mania/5267288) (RC3). The Peruvians quickly showed their prowess with a team FC, with ::{ flag=PE }:: [Ancuw](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18342820)'s 999,699 score being of particular interest.

While most of the match would be defined by its rice picks, it is worth noting some of the strats that both teams employed to throw their rivals off-guard. Look no further than Brazil picking [Minato Aqua - Mada, Aoi (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421032#mania/5278676) (LN2) right after their first loss. While this almost proved to be a valid strat, Brazil unfortunately dropped their lead as ::{ flag=BR }:: [Miwiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9781014) found themselves missing at a crucial point in the map.

Later down the road, after some back and forth rice picks and a delectable 2,991,819 team score in [seatrus - Heavens Station](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421022#mania/5266791) (RC2) by the hands of Brazil, Peru tried to employ the very same strategy of their rivals and picked [orangentle - OEFHEBEN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421040#mania/5266852) (HB1). Much to their dismay, Brazil locked in. Winning their rival's first non-rice pick and denying their rival's match point, Brazil proceeded to bet on HB2 being out of everyone's zone of comfort. Despite a hard-fought full combo by ::{ flag=BR }:: [zKuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25445118) and a score of 995,971, Peru ended up narrowly getting the lead by a meager 1,917 points, ending the match with a 3–5 score.

Congratulations to Peru for winning this close of a match while being the lower seed! Things are not going to get any easier from now on as they'll face Hong Kong during the Round of 16, while Brazil will be against Guatemala in the losers' bracket.
