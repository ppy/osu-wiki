This could've not been as strong of a start to the tournament, even if we would've had wished for it to be! A mix of upsets, close victories, and stellar performances from our top teams all jam-packed into the very, very first round of the tournament. Whether this is an omen of what's to come, that's on future rounds to decide.

With Qualifiers coming to a close, we're finally brought to our first round (of 32). Taking a different approach from the 7 stage structure from Qualifiers, we've got our hands into the first full pool of the tournament which consists of 6 rice slots, 3 hybrid slots, 3 long note slots, and one tiebreaker. With that said, here are some of the most notable highlights from the round!

The best way to start things off is with [Taishi - Distant Relatives (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421252#mania/5267303) (HB3) by ::{ flag=DZ }:: [Scotty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11085809) and ::{ flag=HK }:: [Alptraum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26496648)! With the removal of SV, Round of 32 started with 3 hybrid picks instead of two. And as it is to be expected, HB3 had the most difficult patterning out of all three. With the slot always having a technical focus, you can be sure to expect many dump heavy patterns, intertwining both rice and long note patterns in a rather seamless manner.

In the rice category, a great highlight would be [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421243#mania/5267288) (RC3) by ::{ flag=DE }:: [ababa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8599070). Just like with HB3, Round of 32 also introduced the chordjack slot a round earlier than usual. For an introduction to early-game chordjacks, the approach this chart had was rather unique, but ended up working very well, with the jacks being heavily focused on the vocals of the song. In turn, this resulted in a steady progression of difficulty as the intensity of the vocals increased.

To wrap things up, [Three - Kuuchuu Bunkai (Long Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421253#mania/5267304) (LN1) by ::{ flag=US }:: [fvrex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11863699) and ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) felt like a good ending point to this round's map highlights. Consisting of 200 BPM staggered releases, short streams, and slight 1/3 bursts, it served as a solid introduction to what the long note coordination slot had to offer. Despite the simple patterns, it has — without question — brought a great deal of pain to the players' accuracies, only getting worse as they move into later rounds!

First round in, and we've already got an [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music)? That's right! [muyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/491) made their first appearance in osu! with ['Oumuamua](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421220#mania/5267227) (HB2) charted by ::{ flag=US }:: [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093)! As expected of the HB2 slot, this chart is heavy on the shield and burst usage, which ended up highly benefitting from the electronic-jazz vibes that the song gives off, especially alongside the illustration and graphics design by ::{ flag=PH }:: [Creameries](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15851364) and ::{ flag=MY }:: [Z419](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966)! Even if the chart may be too tricky for you, it is certainly worth giving this interstellar song a listen.

As we briefly spoiled in the post's introduction, this has been anything but a normal beginning to the tournament. A mix of both unforeseen circumstances and some of the underdogs locking in have made this Round of 32 quite a peculiar one, all things considered.

While our top teams have had no issues throughout the round, the closer we got to the middle seeds, the more interesting this week's matches have been!

We can only hope that the following few highlights are proof of it.

### ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia vs. ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland

Glancing at the Qualifiers results, the Philippines seemed to have the advantage in this match, seeded at #14 vs. France's #19. Pick'ems agreed, with 96% people predicting them as victors — but reality is not often what it seems. With seasoned tournament players on the two rosters, no one was going to make this an easy match.

Both teams protected rice maps, and rice is where the match started, with the highly technical [Dz'Xa - Cosmic Crisis (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421249#mania/5267295) (RC6) resulting in a 6-way FC and a narrow 3k victory for the Philippines, wow! A similar situation developed in the second pick: the jumpstream consistency [seatrus - Heavens Station](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421022#mania/5266791) (RC2). But then; disaster struck, with ::{ flag=PH }:: [lyvet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18121419)'s unfortunate disconnect resulting in 5 FCs and France's first win.

Amazingly, not a single miss was dropped in the 3rd map (LN1) either, and it was only in the match's 4th pick, France's protect [sana & Nayugorou - Love Potion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421240#mania/5267282) (RC1), where a couple of misses on the Filipino side gave the point to their opponents. The consistency of these players is truly something to behold!

The match now stood at 2–2. The next pick was [*wakadori - NightTheater](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421059#mania/5266881) (LN3), where lower accuracy with 3 full combos proved to be the key for the first break point of the match, giving France a lead. Fun Fact: [NightTheater](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421059#mania/5266881) was played in 4 matches, with France and the Philippines holding the #1 and #2 spots in the team score leaderboard! But the lead would not last: the Philippines' rice ratio trio of ::{ flag=PH }:: [Velyria](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9423922), ::{ flag=PH }:: [Vulpsi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12584420), and ::{ flag=PH }:: [lyvet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18121419) locked gears, with an incredible back-to-back performance on the FFR Tech pick [Terminal 11 - Cold Storage (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421224#mania/5267239) (RC4) and the chordjack pick [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421243#mania/5267288) (RC3), putting them at match point.

France, now nearing the edge, picked the technical hybrid [Taishi - Distant Relatives](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2421252#mania/5267303) (HB3), a Taishi epic that, even with ::{ flag=FR }:: [DarkMew2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13921965)'s MVP performance, was not enough to overcome the Philippines' minuscule great count, ending the match with a 3.7k point difference.

Fun fact: every single pick in this match was decided by less than 8000 points! A testament to consistency and these players' performance. The Philippines will continue in the winners' bracket facing South Korea, and France will fight Finland in the lower bracket to stay in the tournament. Good luck to both teams!
