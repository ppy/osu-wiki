Send only your warmest welcomes to **Dispel**, our new Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/xxx/header.jpg)

Indonesian producer and [osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15205070) **Dispel** took the optimal music production route: immediately after learning classical piano, they shifted towards the realm of rhythm game music. Inspired by *Laur* and various artcore/gothic hardcore tunes, **Dispel** continuously develops their own distinct sound in the evolving music game scene, and is supported by their production circle *LUMiNOZ* (which is full of [even more osu! players](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams/26313)!).

[**Dispel**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/485) has pre-timed `.osz`s for **11** tracks (a.k.a. everything you could ever want to map).

Seeing as **Dispel** is an osu!mania player, it's only fitting that their songs have seen appreciation across the osu!mania community. See for yourself:

Just a minute ago, you learned that **Dispel** was osu!'s newest Featured Artist, and now you're already going to [**Dispel**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/485) to find the template for your next map. We're so proud.

Next weekend, two things are happening: a new Featured Artist announcement and a new mappool showcase for [osu!catch World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025). Or perhaps... they're the same thing.

Stay tuned.
