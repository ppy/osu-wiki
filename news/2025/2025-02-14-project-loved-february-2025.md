Roses are red, violets are blue, Project Loved is back — this month, just for you.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Happy Valentine's Day! While we cannot give you flowers and chocolates, we can give you a fresh round of amazing maps, all yearning for your attention!

If by any chance you are not aware of what this is, Project Loved hosts community polls every month, where the community gets to decide whether maps put up by each game mode's [captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) get added to the coveted [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). For the next 10 days, you'll be able to cast your vote for each map by clicking on their banners below, or by heading directly to the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) for the full listing.

Thanks to everyone who put their votes in last month! You can see the full results for each game mode below:

- [Results for osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2028691)
- [Results for osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2028690)
- [Results for osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2028689)
- [Results for osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2028688)

If you want to play all the currently nominated maps before voting for them, for the next 7 days you can do so by checking out the Project Loved [osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download) playlists, and even by competing with others for the #1 leaderboard spot!

Before we jump into the maps, there have been major changes within the team, the biggest one of them all being the fact that [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350) has left the team. As one of the people who have been in the team almost since the project's inception, clayton has been instrumental in making Project Loved into what it is today, assisting and maintaining various aspects of the project for many years. We wish clayton the best as they depart from Project Loved, and thank them for the years of selfless and commendable support.

Next to clayton, [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466), a veteran osu!catch community member, has decided to withdraw from Project Loved. While only being in Project Loved for a relatively short time period, their contributions are appreciated, and we wish them the best in their future endeavours.

Along with these departures, the captain applications for osu! have concluded, and with that please send your congratulations to [rHO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1629553), [Plasma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077431), and [momoyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12469536), who have joined the team as of this month!

Lastly, due to a glitch in the time-space continuum some of you might've received a message about your already-Loved maps being nominated again, please feel free to ignore it.

Now without further ado, let's get into the picks for this month.

The first Popular Playcount for this month is [tano c enjoyer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11278761)'s set of [Aiobahn feat. KOTOKO - INTERNET YAMERO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1982563#osu), feat. [TVRemote](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13217182)'s guest difficulty.

KOTOKO and hardstyle..? Well... That's a first.

You might already be familiar with this song from the [official music video](https://youtu.be/51GIxXFKbzk?si=fLlkv68TXytvZRJc) which has a staggering 48 million views. The popularity definitely shows with this map receiving 285,000+ playcount and 900+ favorites whilst unranked. Everyone gets to eat well from this megaset, with 18 difficulties ranging from **2.58★** all the way to **7.39★**. tano c enjoyer did an amazing job with this set, and I would be very glad to see their hard work paying off and having a home here in Project Loved.

Be sure to cast your vote if you want to see this map with a leaderboard!

Here's this month's Outstanding Oldie! 🎶 Wanna listen to some tunes? 🎶

LeaF's [Musical Movement](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/158141#osu), mapped by [DarkVortex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1940325) and [CSLM](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2675027), could work just as well as a Ranked Reject. This mapset from 2014 ended up being modded quite a bit, but never managed to go through the ranking process. However, it was played quite a lot through the years and remembered fondly by players, so here we are to give it a chance! Expect a bunch of streams in the higher difficulties, and linear 215 BPM patterns that make this map feel like a classic you've never had a chance to play. Also, look forward to some rather musical sliders throughout the difficulties! If you haven't given this map a look, make sure to give it a try!

For this week's small spectacles we have [Pendulum - Crush](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1029095#osu/2151929) mapped by [nhlx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3827077).

Originally crafted as a heartfelt tribute to the people who have supported and inspired him, *Crush* stands as a testament to the remarkable achievements of nhlx, a prominent community figure who has motivated hundreds of mappers to push beyond their limits and redefine mapping standards. With its intricate design and relentless intensity, *Crush* challenges players to dive in with unwavering determination, featuring demanding 8★ slider tech jumps that are strictly for the bold and fearless. It's a map that embodies both technical mastery and emotional depth, making it a standout piece in the osu! community. Give it a try, and vote yes!

The level starts with a fast-paced cube section, switching between various game-modes. At 9%, the level decelerates into a cube segment, then a brief straight-fly before returning to another fast-paced cube section with tricky timings. A difficult ship section with fake orbs follows at 18%, transitioning to a brief UFO segment. Just before the drop, simple cube clicks appear, followed by the level's title. The first drop features a tough big-wave section with tight gaps and anti-gravity portals. At 30%, the player starts alternating sizes, increasing difficulty with periodic darkening and brightening effects. At 39%, a half-speed break offers simpler cube, wave and robot sequences amid darker visuals. At 42%, the level brightens with a beach cutscene, leading to a challenging cube-UFO-spider segment and a quadruple-speed dual. Before the second drop, there is a double-speed wave segment followed by a slower cube part with occasional mini-wave clicks intertwined. The second drop is at quadruple-speed, beginning with a wave section until 62%, where game-modes start rapidly alternating. Subsequently, at 72%, another wave segment appears, arguably the hardest of the level. The following finale, with an orange sunset palette, includes fast cube clicks, a challenging ship section, and a final wave segment with tight spaces. The level ends at 95%, displaying 'THANKS FOR PLAYING' alternating with 'WATCHING', followed by verification info and credits.

If your osu!loved workout has consisted of 10 reps of [CYBER INDUCTANCE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1929702) into [FUTURE DOMINATORS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1286450) until failure, this month's Ranked Rejects pick is just the exercise to add to your regimen.

This month we bring you [Irreversible Mechanism - The Agony](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/958345) mapped by [Awfulness](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8852605), and if you want to know what this map is about, the title should speak for itself. This is a full set of five difficulties ranging all the way to **7.6★** which will test your 230 BPM streaming capabilities, no matter what level you're at. Although it's amassed quite the playcount and favorites over the years and featured in countless community tournaments (I miss the old NM5), it's only now that we have a chance to give it the leaderboard it deserves.

If you're ready to shred, make sure to give this mapset a vote!

This month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* will put your rhythm intuition to the test — it's \[nitro - [line:theta\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1080259#osu/2260036) by [eridsV](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5254893).

Although it only clocks in at around 6 stars, this song sprinkles in 1/3, 1/5, and more rhythms that I can't even describe, making the map trickier than it lets on. Also, it's not just rhythm hell but aim control hell too, with plenty of slider patterns, geometric patterns and back-and-forths. Tech map enjoyers will likely have a blast with this, but even if you don't consider yourself one, the infectious tune and simple-yet-effective mapping style combine to make this map a strangely addictive experience.

Make sure to give this gem a try and your vote for Loved!

If anyone out there wished that the world's most popular song had a Thai cover, then this ought to do the trick. Two full minutes of peak mapped by namirin1 will set you right in for one of the greatest osu! experiences ever.

But don't take our word for it, try it yourself and come back to give this map a vote if you want to see it Loved!

Gathering over 70,000 plays and 100 favourites since 2021, I thought it would be a good time to finally introduce this set into Loved. With difficulties ranging from 2.21★ to 4.5★ that follow a simple yet fun and engaging gameplay design, *Wait a Minute! (Cut Ver.)* is great for all the casual players out there.

WILLOW also happens to be one of my favourite artists, so this pick is extra special to me. If you also want to see this Loved, then make sure you vote!

Revived all the way from 2015, we're bringing one of the best higher-SR mappers from their time back with this one. If you were around in **6★**+ multiplayer lobbies from the years of 2016–2018, I'm sure you've played this map once or twice. This is **7.23★** of raw aim littered with bursts and a fun little 1/3 section, very generic but very fun and well made. I'll let the map do the talking.

Heh, I suppose I shouldn't be sharing all this info around yet, since some of my greatest rivals from heaven may be stooping around... In the meantime, just between us, how about a yes vote to spread the word of demon aim!  MWUAHAHAHAHAH!!!

[Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574) (a.k.a. KTYN) is back at it again in Loved voting. However, the map we have for this month is slightly different from what you typically see from their other Loved maps. This time we're bringing you a meme monstrosity by the name of [TADAIMAA!!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1321343#taiko/2737122). This is an otomad mix of the song "Baqeela" by owl\*tree along with the sounds of gacha series diva Karyl from *Princess Connect! Re:Dive*, stressing her happiness of returning home.

This incredibly fun map is not your typical double-BPM speed map, it's a map with tons of distinct personalities meshed into one map. With Waribashi's comfy 1/3 + 1/4 patterning and smart usages of repeating patterns, along with [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757)'s SVs, the ninja finishers, barcode gimmicks, and kiai flashes bring tons of twists to compliment the different sound layers of the remix.

If the SVs are overwhelming you, feel free to check out the "No SV" difficulty to get familiar with the patterns before coming back to challenge the "Welcome back" difficulty, I'm sure Karyl will always be here to greet you.

If you're a bit newer to the taiko scene, this would be a good time to familiarize yourself with the map that took place in times when taiko mappers started understanding what to do in the editor. [All is Fair in Love and kemomimi loli](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1103163) is a classic from this era, brought to you by y¹¹petu and someone everyone should be familiar with by now, [Hoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574)!

This map offers a perfect challenge for those getting into higher-BPM consistency and 1/6 maps, giving you pretty mild, but extremely fun tech patterns. Petu and Hoku have done a great job providing a map that can be enjoyed by many skill levels alike and the play and fav counts show that off well!

After almost a year of radio silence, a [7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/356) song is back in the Loved voting.

This map is a collaboration between [miyagishima](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8027517), [Lefty3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4719175) and Majimanjiwwwww — players and mappers who shouldn't need an introduction. Although one might scoff at the idea of another version of *7D* being put up for Loved voting within such a short time frame, do not be deceived.

On top of this map persistently utilizing high density, the mappers have also found a way to incorporate 1/6 and 1/8 bursts at a staggering **363.5 BPM!** All of that, bundled into a map rated **9.37★** (**10.17★** in the upcoming rework!), should most definitely incentivize you to test your limits with this absolute gauntlet of a speed map.

So, what are you waiting for?

Do you like brain training? If so, [So Sus + Konka - Acorn](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1901430#taiko/3919984) by [Faputa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/845733) is for you! The strong SVs and their patterns make this a very challenging map. SVs that appear cluttered are actually consistently placed and calculated by the mapper. It also actively incorporates novel ideas, such as a gimmick that uses overlapping note sequences to make the player press the note at the same time.

We look forward to you playing *Acorn*!

Many of you would know [Boaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13302996) for their tougher Ranked maps. [Batsu Neko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1543534#taiko), on the other hand, is a seemingly tame song, sitting at an innocuous 3.38★ — but let not its appearance fool you! Custom-mapped for [IGTS 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/IGTS_2021), this map features simple barline gimmicks, as well as a slew of SVs to keep you on your toes, offering a great introduction to the wild world of NM5 maps.

Being the first gimmick map I've played, which I'm sure is the case for many others in the tournament as well, this map has always had a special place in my heart. So whether you're a new player looking to have a go at gimmicks, or an experienced player trying to relive the past, be sure to vote!

What happens when some of the best taiko mappers team up to create a TWC Grand Finals NM2? You get [s/c/a/p/e/g/o/a/t](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2169956#taiko/4579405).

s/c/a/p/e/g/o/a/t is a collab by none other than [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) and [cdh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2403621). Over the years, both have successfully managed to solidify their place as the crème de la crème of tournament mapping, and this map is no exception. s/c/a/p/e/g/o/a/t could be considered a spiritual successor to cdh's [\*\*\*\*\*\*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2069665#taiko/4330515), a map that excelled in multiple [Mappers' Choice Awards 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-02-01-mappers-choice-awards-2023) categories, mainly Best Technical and Best Unorthodox, not to mention the fact that it also received the Grand Award of 2023!

s/c/a/p/e/g/o/a/t, being a techy dump map, makes itself very apparent as to why it was chosen as a [TWC Grand Finals](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024#grand-finals) map, and you'd be foolish to expect a let-up from the sheer abundance of higher snaps this map has to offer. Although difficulty is a large part of why this map has received so much praise, it additionally features several barline gimmicks that create a very pleasing visual effect throughout the whole map!

Ever wanted to feel like the main *p/r/o/t/a/g/o/n/i/s/t* of a TWC Grand Finals match? Look no further, just play s/c/a/p/e/g/o/a/t.

Are you feeling funky? [Jimmy Weckl - System "Z"](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2092777#taiko/4387440) by [FORMless000](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8697654) will solve that! Mapped for MDC and used in TWC2024's Quarterfinals stage, *System "Z"* stands out for its unique blend of unusual rhythms that are easy to understand and play along to.

The majority of the map is built around groovy 1/4 patterns with 1/6 patterns interspersed, with the peak in difficulty being 1/6 that is an unusual length or on unusual snapping (oftentimes with several other 1/6 patterns around it!). These can throw those off who are not prepared for the rhythm *System "Z"* demands. Overall, *System "Z"* is a great map and a very fun entry point for those looking to get used to maps with unique, technical or erratic rhythms.

Enjoy! :"D"

[Kyptoric](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1361268) is a well-known name in the catch community, and they already have an insane amount of Loved maps (11 in total!). You can already expect a certain level of quality when seeing their name.

[Marie-Luise](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/407530#fruits/885281) is a map from 2016. It has very early Kyptoric mapping but is outstanding in quality and plays very well. The style is dated, but the simplicity of it and how the patterns fit the song very well make it very enjoyable. You don't need to be fast to be able to play this map, nor do you need a high amount of stamina. This makes it a good practice map for a lot of people. As long as you are consistent enough with hitting the back-and-forth hyper patterns, you will probably do decent enough on it.

A bit of a different Kyptoric pick, but I hope you fully enjoy it!

[Zyzyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2888013) has been around in the mapping community for some time now, with many Loved mapsets (6 until now).

This map was an [osu!catch World Cup 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2021) Grand Finals custom map, which took off in terms of playcount over the last 4 years. This was due to its fun patterning, consisting of broken streams and anti-flows blended with wiggles, in addition to the song being well-liked by the community and being popularized by waywern2012's osu! mode jump map of *Crazy banger*.

I hope you enjoy this pick; this one's a banger.

[H1Pur](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15756120)'s SV mapping career is an interesting one to look at. [*GIMME DA BLOOD*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1428709#mania/2941393), previously featured in our Loved catalogue, was one of their first features in an [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2021 mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K#:\~:text=C%2Dshow%20%2D%20GIMME%20DA%20BLOOD%20(H1Pur)%20%5BGIMME%20DA%20SV%5D), and while they had other notable tournament features such as [SVSE1's](/wiki/Tournaments/SVSE/1) [*Nothing but Theory*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1422643) or [4DM4's](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/4#round-of-32) [*TURBO*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1570808#mania/3207557), we thought it was more appropriate to feature [MWC4K2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K)'s *FireStarter*!

Despite being an early game entry, I do think that *FireStarter* is not as easy as it seems. Some fastjam and slowjam transitions can be really tricky to handle, especially when maintaining accuracy in a tournament situation is required to snag a precious point from your opponent. SV difficulty can arguably be split between learning and accuracy difficulty. In that sense, *FireStarter* is fairly straightforward to learn, but may require advanced SV mastery to get a really high score on.

It's never too late to start getting your hands into the SV skillset. Go ahead, get your vote in the thread, and enjoy a banger from Tanger!

It's no doubt that \[[GS\]hina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20040607) has had a long overdue Loved nomination, but that finally changes with their chart of [Nee Nee Nee](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1543302#mania/3154612)!

If you recognize their name, it's very likely you're familiar with their wide variety of charts, more specifically jumpstream, with one of their most notable charts being [#WE_STILL_LOVE_PERFUME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2192542#mania/4638068). *Nee Nee Nee* is in the same boat when it comes to jumpstream, however, this one is noticeably much easier, possibly being one of the leading reasons why it's their most popular unranked chart. With the BPM only being 145, it can end up being a really fun chart for the many players who are looking to improve on their consistency, or improve in general! Of course, there are uprates for those seeking a greater challenge. Beware, however, as the note density itself is rather large, so this scales in difficulty quickly!

Hopefully, when you saw this chart on the news post, you instantly went to vote yes instead of reading the description, to which I say, good! If you read this, then you should do the same!

[Let's Go Faster](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1124754#mania/2395973) is quite the jack chart, and the title itself is already fitting for the challenges it presents to you. [Cokii-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6760124) already has a few charts in the Loved category and now they are here running to get another map in Project Loved.

See, this chart lasts for a very long time, with the song being around over six and a half minutes. What's really difficult about this chart is how many jack patterns are thrown at you. Due to how long this chart is, it opens up so many possibilities for different kinds of jack charting to be present. For example, there's the presence of dense chordjacks, minijacks, and even jacks that have different snappings, where some are 1/3 but most are 1/4. If you think that chordjacks are the only challenge here, then think again, as the presence of some rolls and jumpstreams/handstreams that you still have to pay attention to will definitely pose a threat to your consistency.

[Let's Jack Moderately Fast](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1124754#mania/2395976) and [Let's Jack Faster](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1124754#mania/2350199) do have some minor differences, where the latter difficulty is a bit denser on some parts, while Moderately Fast would instead have minijacks in replacement for them. It's really a pick-your-poison thing whenever you play these two difficulties, as they both present different challenges that you have to overcome.

By the way, if you REALLY WANT a challenge, then I suggest playing the higher rates for both difficulties. This is when your stamina and speed would really be tested, and one would really have a challenge in being able to maintain such high accuracy and consistency throughout the entire chart.

Are you ready to push your limits and overcome this incredibly long jack chart? Then "Let's Go Faster" and APPROVE THIS CHART FOR LOVED!

If I had a dollar for every [cosmospice](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10780587) nomination that contained three difficulties that start at *Hard*, used a notoriously popular song, and had an extremely large playcount, I'd have two... which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice. Regardless, we're happy to introduce their second nomination, [Sound Chimera](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1107469#mania)!

With the [osu! Loved set](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/813569#osu/1706210) being a big factor in why this song became so popular, it's safe to assume osu!mania players were looking for their game mode's equivalent. Luckily, this fit the bill. With three difficulties, you're given large accessibility which helps those who are still looking to improve their skill, with the lower two difficulties both being very focused on straightforward jumpstream. The top diff, on the other hand, not only increases the density, but adds in long notes to the mix, which can trip many up due to the need of having to coordinate alongside maintaining your accuracy.

With the simple approach to charting, a lot of casual players have found great enjoyment as a result, especially if you play for song choice. Considering the popularity it holds, you're likely one of those people, and to that I say: vote!

[Pizza69](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25285704) and [hi19hi19](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1014473) are very well known for creating difficult technical charts in the 4K scene, and [You Show](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1563147#mania/3192082) is no exception to that.

There are so many factors to what makes this chart very difficult. Don't get me started with how much rolly tech this entire chart has. The thing with patterns like this is that it's so easy to mess up, and whenever you mistime a certain section, you'd typically get a lot of bad judgments which can make your accuracy go down by a large amount. Speed + technicality has always been a big challenge that's been present in many tournaments, and it's no surprise that this was selected for [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup 4's Grand Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/4#grand-finals). Oh yeah, there are also tons of minijacks here that could easily make your hands very unstable.

Now, if you think that wasn't hard enough, wait 'til you see that there are SVs up to 1.3x. Jumping from 180 BPM to 234 BPM is going to be such a daunting task, especially considering the tons of challenges this chart already gives you. That said, I'm very confident that the best of the best players will compete for such a challenge.

Are you ready to face the task of being able to play a technical speed chart? Do you want to experience the pressure and the challenge of being able to hold on as you compete with some of the best players in the world? Then go vote YES for this chart, as YOU put on a SHOW!

[Emida](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11937683) is back for a second time with one of their most popular charts [*inabakumori - Lost Umbrella*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1396761#mania/2882628).

This map of a very well-known song is perfect for people trying to find something to help improve their ability to read LN density. The patterning itself is very approachable, even with some LN jacks that appear every so often. As a result, it is a perfect beatmap to use and push yourself to read LN at faster and faster speeds. Do be aware when playing though, there are some tricky SV stops and many long jacks that can appear. You will have to stay on your toes while playing, or else you will find yourself lost in the noodles.

Sometimes LN maps can be way too complicated with all the shields, awkward releases, and high-BPM streams. If you want something simple to be able to turn your brain off and start smashing keys to a banger song, this is going to be the pick for you, so why don't you just press YES now!!

This chart expresses the strong bass and synth characteristic of USAO songs with dump-style notes, which is very satisfying for players. The speed patterns that follows the vocal chop, and the stream structure that comes out at the same time as the snap transition in the drop, are also very pleasing. We think this map is a good example of dump speed and a good recommendation for 7K players who are not familiar with this type of patterning. This map was also used as the [MWC 7K 2022 QF speed pick](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K).

A picture is worth a thousand words. Vote for Evening now and show your support!

Nocturne is an excellent song brought to you by Jay Chou, the most famous and prominent singer in the Chinese-speaking region. Even if you cannot understand the elegant lyrics, the enchanting melody is still a part you will not miss!

This month we're here to nominate a set that contains 4K and 7K, and both of them are of an LN coordination + release style. The 4K diff has been featured in many tournaments and the 7K diff itself is very famous in the community already. Although the star rating seems low, we still suggest doing some preparation before chasing the high-accuracy scores!

Considering both the quality and population of the set, please vote \*\*Yes\*\* if you like it!

[Nor feat. Kohara Konomi - RE Aoharu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1949787#mania) by [-dreamy witch-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7240849)\

Given how mainstream *Blue Archive* songs have become, they have undoubtedly gained significant popularity among many players in the community. Taking this opportunity, we are excited to present [RE Aoharu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1949787#mania/4036755) by [-dreamy witch-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7240849)!

The chart features a full spread of difficulty levels, ranging from easy to expert, allowing players to progress and challenge themselves as they play. While the chart primarily follows a normal hybrid style with a well-balanced mix of rice and LN usage, there are several sections that demand tight coordination and inverse skills to execute properly. Be sure to prepare yourself by mastering some niche skill sets, particularly in the long note department!

-dreamy witch- is one of the newer mappers in the Loved scene who have earned this opportunity, due to the map's growing popularity. We hope you'll agree with us and show your support by casting a positive vote for this chart!

If you made it this far, we definitely don't have to remind you to vote for all the maps you want to see in the Loved category, and we *definitely* don't have to remind you that you can always check out the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh) for more information.

Also, we might've slipped a little lie earlier about the chocolates and flowers. Have these, and happy Valentine's Day! 🍫💐
