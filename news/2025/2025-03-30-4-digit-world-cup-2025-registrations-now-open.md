Attention all 4 digit osu! players — the 4 Digit World Cup is back for another round!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/4WC/2025/img/banner.png)

The **[4 Digit World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2059343?n=1)**, or 4WC for short, has been the longest-running rank-restricted world cup tournament ever since its first iteration in 2018. Striving to be the highlight of the year for players within the 4 digit (#1,000–9,999) rank range, 4WC continues its rich history of seasoned veterans fighting it out against strong newcomers. Please look forward to the new things this iteration has to offer!

[Last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-06-24-4-digit-world-cup-2024-concludes) broke records again with 58 teams competing for the crown. The reigning champions ::{ flag=US }:: United States proved their worth with a conclusive 7–3 win against returning finalist ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada, claiming the first back-to-back titles in 4WC history. The old guard of ::{ flag=CN }:: China rounded out the podium at 3rd place, bringing them back to the top after a 7–8th finish in the previous year.

To spice up the competition, we're shifting the difficulty of the mappools down a gear this time in order to make the tournament more accessible for a wider range of players. Additionally, scores set with the Easy mod on Free Mod picks will feature custom per-map multipliers as opposed to a global multiplier.

## How do I register?

To register, simply head over to the [**registration page**](https://osu.ppy.sh/oauth/authorize?client_id=21966&redirect_uri=https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyvyWQC-FzgG_ijZFCpDrdWqdtvwPC3OoccYTI4jZHPml5Gtc6QpH5ZJn9tnRbFnTDgDA/exec&response_type=code&scope=identify&state=%7B%22step%22%3A%22osu%22%7D) to connect your osu! and Discord accounts. Players who sign up and meet the following criteria will be eligible to participate:

- **Your osu! global rank must be within #1,000–9,999 at the time of registrations closing.** (April 20, 23:59 UTC)
- **You must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months.**

All countries with at least 5 eligible registrants will have one player designated as the captain by the organisers. The captain is then responsible for selecting and submitting a roster of 5–8 players to represent their country in the tournament. Countries with more than 8 candidates are encouraged to host tryouts for their team to aid in selecting the best players.

Joining the official [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/uQarcRtB3u) of 4WC is mandatory for all players selected on a team, but we still encourage everyone, even spectators, to join in order to keep up with all important announcements and tournament livestream notifications. Be sure to also check out the [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2059343?n=1) or the [wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/4WC/2025) for more information and rules. Come along for the ride!
