If a new type of sound is what you're looking for, **rae** is here to deliver.

Inspired by the likes of [Frums](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/68), [katagiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/176), and an unexpected *JPEGMAFIA*, **rae** is a Canadian electronic producer currently based in the United States. While their musical endeavours began during the 2020 lockdown, they released their first batch of tracks three years later.

As of today, they've made their way to the osu! world with a batch of **4** tracks, all up for grabs from [**rae**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/464).

Pick up a pre-timed `.osz` and try mapping for yourself:

You know what needs to happen. [**rae**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/464) and the editor are collectively calling your name.

Wondering when the next Featured Artist will be announced? There's obviously no precedent for this, but we'd estimate ~~exactly~~ approximately one week from today.

Stay tuned.
