*And for our next number, we'd like to return to the classics*. OWC 2025 got underway with a visit to a seemingly bygone era, reintroducing the Group Stage format — but now with a modern twist.

The top 8 teams in the Qualifiers headed straight into the bracket stage, where they'd sit comfortably throughout the Group Stage awaiting their opponents. Teams 9 through 24, meanwhile, were placed in the "Challenger" groups together to battle it out, with the top two teams in each group earning a spot in the winners' bracket and the bottom two dropping to the losers' bracket. Finally, teams 25 through 40 would have their nerves tested in the Group Stage, as only the top 2 teams in the "Contender" groups would make it into the losers' bracket, with the remaining two eliminated entirely.

How would the teams fare? How would the drama of the first two weeks of head-to-head play in this year's osu! World Cup unfold? Read on to find out!

For the first head-to-head pool of the tournament, the Group Stage pool was mostly focused on easier maps and consistency. For starters, we had a couple of interesting customs, such as [rollpan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3062998)'s [Kyokugen BON Odori](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455340#osu/5365982) and [Flask](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/959763)'s [Glass](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455024#osu/5364986), the former being a speedy endeavour with a tapping focus (and an adorable storyboard to boot!), while the latter was a Chinese pop DT pick focused on flow and alt patterns, with a fairly tough solo section that made for many interesting points. Maps such as the technical [Heliosphere](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455343#osu/5365985) and the streamy [NIGHTMARE INVITATION](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2454994#osu/5364927) are also new, showcasing [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) that debuted in other modes' world cups, something that the team has talked about being more keen to do this year.

The pool also had its fair share of existing Ranked maps. The infamous [Chocolate Disco](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1437192#osu/2957016) was picked as a NM3 — a deceptively hard reading map, having a star rating of below 4.5 while sitting in a pool with maps that went up to over 7 stars. Other maps, such as [Elder Things](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1877186#osu/3863677) and [Imaike Samba](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2243785#osu/4769759), rounded the pool out and served as tapping and aim mechanics challenges, respectively. To cap it off, [saido39](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11278761)'s [Destin Victorica (Harddance Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318863#osu/4966899) was selected as the tiebreaker: a very upbeat, mechanically intensive outing that provided many matches with an exciting finish.

Not to be left unmentioned, [alien friend request](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2242333#osu/4766086) by [melon boy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3053382) and company was also a standout pick in the pool, being an extremely diverse mechanics map featuring a song composed by the creators of the map itself! A catchy, charming song on a fun, creative map made it a truly memorable selection.

This pool also had the first debut of an [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) for the tournament, introducing the world to the jazzy, electronic [Showoff Showdown](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455348#osu/5365995), by the great [MEMODEMO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/508)!

A shorter, funky yet classy original, [MEMODEMO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/508)'s contributions were mapped by the one and only [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552), being used as a precision Hard Rock pick with a flow alt focus. Throughout the 48 Group Stage matches, we got to know both the song and map very well, yet it seemed as if it never got old — a truly remarkable achievement.

## Group Stage results

### Group A

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=CN }:: China | **3** | 0 | 15 | 6 | **+9** | 9 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=NO }:: Norway | **2** | 1 | 12 | 5 | **+7** | 13 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=AT }:: Austria | **1** | 2 | 8 | 13 | **-5** | 17 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand | **0** | 3 | 4 | 15 | **-11** | 21 |

A fascinating group on paper, Group A featured the overall #9 and #13 seeds China and Norway, both of whom had high expectations heading into this year's World Cup, but Austria and Thailand looked to play spoiler in the fight for winners' bracket positions. China put on a standout performance to finish 3–0 in the group despite the tough opposition, while Thailand unfortunately struggled to a 0–3 result. Norway looked incredibly impressive as they notched 5–0 victories against [Austria](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119768390) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2612848277?t=0h4m56s)) and [Thailand](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119768679) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2612892338)) to claim the #2 seed out of the group, meaning Austria was left the #3 seed on their way to the losers' bracket.

**Highlight match:** [China vs. Austria](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119769022) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2612848277?t=2h4m39s)). The #17 seed Austria gave China a tough fight, winning 3 points from a steep underdog position.

**Group MVP:** Captain ::{ flag=CN }:: [lolol235](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6090175) (a.k.a. Davidqu2) played every map for China en route to a 1.464 performance score to help lead his team to the #1 seed in the group.

### Group B

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=NZ }:: New Zealand | **3** | 0 | 15 | 5 | **+10** | 16 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=RO }:: Romania | **1** | 2 | 9 | 11 | **-2** | 12 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland | **1** | 2 | 9 | 11 | **-2** | 22 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia | **1** | 2 | 6 | 12 | **-6** | 18 |

Group B started off on the first weekend by matching most expectations, with Finland suffering a 2–5 loss against both [New Zealand](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119709590) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2606838974?t=0h4m23s)) and [Indonesia](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119720537) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2607784567?t=1h4m34s)). New Zealand went on to claim a commanding 3–0 result on the second weekend, but with Finland surprising everyone by beating [Romania 5–1](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119771875) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2612999141?t=2h15m45s)), the #2 spot became anyone's game. All of the weight was placed on the final match of the group, Romania vs. Indonesia: Indonesia's win would guarantee them top 2, while Romania had to win while dropping at most one point, or else Finland would place above both teams. With Indonesia winning the first point, Romania, with their backs against the wall, managed to clutch up five entire points in a row to put them into the [top 2 by the skin of their teeth](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119781605) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2613934492)).

**Highlight match:** [Romania vs. Finland](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119771875) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2612999141?t=2h15m45s)), where Finland put up a huge upset, beating the top seed of the group 5–1 as the bottom seed.

**Group MVP:** While ::{ flag=RO }:: [badeu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1473890) had the highest individual performance in the group, the MVP has to go to ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Kyujin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15293080), who put up a similar performance for New Zealand as a part of their 3–0 run in the group.

### Group C

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile | **2** | 1 | 14 | 7 | **+7** | 10 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=FR }:: France | **2** | 1 | 12 | 7 | **+5** | 15 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=ES }:: Spain | **2** | 1 | 12 | 9 | **+3** | 20 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=IT }:: Italy | **0** | 3 | 0 | 15 | **-15** | 23 |

Group C saw only one upset, but this was a huge shake-up from expectations coming into the group. Longtime OWC viewers will recognise that this performance from Italy is a far cry from their potential as a team. Nearly everyone expected Chile and France to top the group, but Spain pulled off a massive [upset win over Chile 5–4](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119713766) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2607171418?t=0h3m30s)) and forced a 3-way tie for first place. Aside from that one upset, however, this group went exactly according to seeding in every match and ended up with final placements matching the Qualifier seeding as well.

**Highlight match:** [Chile vs. Spain](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119713766) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2607171418?t=0h3m30s)) and [France vs. Spain](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119783601) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2613988017?t=1h13m55s)) both have decent arguments as a highlight match in this group. Chile vs. Spain is the one upset and the only tiebreaker in the group, while France vs. Spain saw multiple scenarios at play based on the exact point-wise result of the match as the final match of the group.

**Group MVP:** ::{ flag=CL }:: [Intercambing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2546001) returns to the osu! World Cup once again this year and comes out the gate swinging with a top 6 overall individual performance, by far the best in this group.

### Group D

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil | **2** | 1 | 13 | 9 | **+4** | 11 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines | **2** | 1 | 13 | 9 | **+4** | 14 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden | **1** | 2 | 10 | 13 | **-3** | 19 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands | **1** | 2 | 8 | 13 | **-5** | 24 |

Group D was expected to be the closest Challenger group on paper, but after week 1, it looked a bit boring. The first three matches in this group went exactly according to seeding, but in week 2, the upset floodgates opened. [Philippines 5–3 Brazil](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119771221) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2612999141?t=1h4m20s)), [Sweden 5–3 Philippines](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119781933) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2613838964?t=2h13m10s)), and [Netherlands 5–3 Sweden](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119784200) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2613988017?t=2h13m58s)), alongside Brazil's first two wins in week 1, mean that everyone beats everyone, and in the end, Brazil comes out on top. This group was so close that the top 2 teams tied in map wins, map losses, and point differential. Not only that, but the top 3 teams in this group were all in the top 6 of teams overall in the group stage, and the Netherlands *still* managed to commendably take a win on one of those top 3 teams. All 4 of these teams are going to be threats in the bracket stage.

**Highlight match:** [Sweden vs. Netherlands](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119784200) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2613988017?t=2h13m58s)) was the upset match almost no one predicted, with the Netherlands being dubbed the default bottom team in the group before matches had begun.

**Group MVP:** While ::{ flag=SE }:: [scylla](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9405745) had the best individual performance of anyone in this group, placing 2nd overall, the MVP has to go to ::{ flag=PH }:: [NathanRam1918](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4734703), whose herculean performance kept Philippines in the winners' bracket, 1 point away from first place in the group.

### Group E

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan | **3** | 0 | 15 | 2 | **+13** | 26 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia | **2** | 1 | 11 | 9 | **+2** | 33 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam | **1** | 2 | 9 | 13 | **-4** | 32 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=DK }:: Denmark | **0** | 3 | 4 | 15 | **-11** | 37 |

Group E saw its top seed Taiwan easily make their way through as the #1 finisher, dropping only 2 maps en route to a 3–0 record, while bottom seeded Denmark went 0–3, leaving matters up to Malaysia and Vietnam to fight for the #2 seed to avoid elimination. The decisive battle of the group resulted in a [5–3 win](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119701959) for Malaysia ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2606047907?t=0h4m57s)), giving them a 2–1 record and the coveted second seed.

**Highlight match:** Vietnam vs. Malaysia. The first match of the group to be played was the most important of all as it would eventually determine the #2 and #3 seeds.

**Group MVP:** Despite failing to advance from the group, Vietnam's ::{ flag=VN }:: [def](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21619075) was the highest-rated player in Group E, participating in all 22 maps for his team and finishing with a 1.376 performance score.

### Group F

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=TR }:: Türkiye | **3** | 0 | 15 | 3 | **+12** | 25 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina | **2** | 1 | 11 | 11 | **0** | 30 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=BE }:: Belgium | **1** | 2 | 8 | 14 | **-6** | 38 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=UY }:: Uruguay | **0** | 3 | 9 | 15 | **-6** | 34 |

Group F featured a somewhat surprising participant in Türkiye, finishing in the top 16 of last year's osu! World Cup and looked to be on an upward trend yet fell down to seed #25 in this year's Qualifiers. They proved believers right by bulldozing through the group with a 3–0 record and a strong +12 point differential. The other three teams fought valiantly against one another to attempt to claim the remaining spot in the bracket, including Belgium, getting through Qualifiers for the first time ever, battling against perennial participants Argentina and Uruguay. The group came down to the wire as the [Uruguay vs. Belgium](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119783013) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2614065130)) and [Argentina vs. Uruguay](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119784197) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2614160224)) matches both went to tiebreakers, but it was Argentina who finished second in the group by defeating both Belgium and Uruguay.

**Highlight match:** Both tiebreaker matches were highly exciting in their own right, with Belgium finding a long-awaited World Cup win in their tiebreaker map, while Argentina vs. Uruguay featured a back-and-forth battle of carry performances that came down to a score difference of only 19,869 points when the dust settled!

**Group MVP:** ::{ flag=TR }:: [Raikouhou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8007528) was, in a word, stellar. He FC'd a ridiculous 13 of the 14 maps he played, earning himself the 5th-best performance score of all Group Stage participants at 1.619. His scores [might need to be seen to be believed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ovPsPHgma8evar5czRmjhl0OGKybuzP9nvi95XFlxc/edit?gid=1147375018#gid=1147375018), including the #1 overall scores on NM1 and HR2, the #1, #3, and #4 scores on DT3, and 3 of the top 10 scores on NM2.

### Group G

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=KZ }:: Kazakhstan | **3** | 0 | 15 | 4 | **+11** | 27 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru | **2** | 1 | 11 | 10 | **+1** | 39 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=PT }:: Portugal | **1** | 2 | 11 | 13 | **-2** | 36 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=UA }:: Ukraine | **0** | 3 | 5 | 15 | **-10** | 29 |

Group G forced viewers and players alike to confront the unfortunate reality of war as Ukraine suffered rolling power outages that made it impossible to ever play a match with their full roster, alongside technical difficulties for those who could make those matches. This made Kazakhstan the default top team in the group and allowed Peru and Portugal to compete for the second spot in the bracket stage. Kazakhstan won their first, second, and third ever matches in OWC, Peru won their first and second matches ever in OWC, and Portugal won their first match since before OWC was run by the osu! team.

**Highlight match:** [Portugal vs. Peru](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119724770) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2608182376?t=0h5m15s)) was the deciding matchup no one expected in week one. On top of being a close match at 5–3 with both teams showing solid scores, there were some shenanigans in the commentary booth that are best experienced firsthand.

**Group MVP:** ::{ flag=PE }:: [[MG]Arnold24x24](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2291265) was the single best player in the entire Group Stage. He is both the reason Peru qualified and the reason they have won any matches, playing every single map for Peru and averaging over 850k (not counting mod multipliers). This is a performance that goes beyond incredible as he continues to cement himself as one of the best tournament players of all time. Honourable mention goes to ::{ flag=KZ }:: [Kamensh1k](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16817965), who also played every map for Kazakhstan and averaged just under 850k. Both of these players were real titans in their group.

### Group H

| # | Team | Wins | Losses | PF | PA | PD | Seed |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 | ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan | **3** | 0 | 15 | 6 | **+9** | 28 |
| #2 | ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore | **2** | 1 | 13 | 11 | **+2** | 31 |
| #3 | ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong | **1** | 2 | 11 | 14 | **-3** | 40 |
| #4 | ::{ flag=GR }:: Greece | **0** | 3 | 7 | 15 | **-8** | 35 |

This group was the one most people were split on going into the weekend, and the team names should be enough to illustrate why. Hong Kong, after losing their three best players from last year, managed to [beat Greece on tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119781345) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2613838964?t=1h6m5s)) but [lost to Singapore in the same fashion](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119721465) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2607784567?t=3h3m7s)), with the latter match deciding the group. Japan had a relatively easy time in this group except against Singapore, where they only [won 5–3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119770610) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2612999141?t=0h5m6s)), and went undefeated. Singapore also continues their run into the losers' bracket, while Hong Kong and Greece are eliminated. Greece, however, qualified into the osu! World Cup for the first time since 2016.

**Highlight match:** [Singapore vs. Hong Kong](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119721465) ([VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2607784567?t=3h3m7s)) went to tiebreaker as the effective deciding match in the group.

**Group MVP:** ::{ flag=HK }:: [misha awa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14503423), while unable to carry Hong Kong into the losers' bracket, still made the top 5 in individual performances across the entire group stage, showcasing the raw skill he has accrued over the last year of community tournaments and almost pulling through in the tiebreaker against Singapore.
