Another iteration of the 4 Digit World Cup is behind us. Let's take a look at what happened this year.

![](/wiki/Tournaments/4WC/2025/img/banner.png)

Eagles soaring through May and June, our first original song, and loads of intense matches — the 2025 iteration of 4WC has concluded, and with it we are closing a large chapter of the series' history. Let's have a rundown of what went down over the past couple of months in the most intense 4 digit osu! tournament.

## Summary

![4WC 2025 podium](/wiki/Tournaments/4WC/2025/img/podium.png "4WC 2025 podium")

Congratulations to the United States for their third repeat and fourth overall victory. Beating their record from the previous year by one point and dropping only 9 maps, they continued their dominance with a 7–0 sweep in the Grand Finals against returning runner-ups of Canada.

Rounding out the podium this time around was Poland with their first top 3 finish. The Polish team showed great results throughout the tournament, going 6–1 against the strong teams of both Sweden and the Russian Federation, before ultimately falling to Canada on a tiebreaker in the lower bracket Grand Finals.

## Grand Finals recap

The Grand Finals weekend featured two matches that were complete polar opposites to each other. Poland, Canada and the United States were all fighting for the highest podium spot. Starting the weekend off was the 3rd-seeded Poland taking on the 4th-seeded Canada. Both of these teams had been sent to the losers' bracket by the United States; Poland on the Finals stage and Canada a week earlier in the Semifinals.

Poland started off the first match with an immediate break point on Canada's [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2362425#osu/5092736) pick, where ::{ flag=CA }:: [yip](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5177569)'s solid 571,521 S rank on the side of Canada was not enough to offset Poland's team consistency with no player on their team getting below 400,000 points. They followed this with a [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2227145#osu/4724781) pick, which Canada took early advantage of with solid combos from the resident Canadian speed players ::{ flag=CA }:: [Rum Indra](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2758279) and ::{ flag=CA }:: [Birchman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676573). However, breaks near the end of the map tightened up the score lead, with ::{ flag=PL }:: [hav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14100781) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [szedis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14282987) holding strong towards the ending. With very little combo remaining on any players, a 3-way break from Canada sealed the deal, and Poland secured a break point advantage by only 16,352 points.

Canada fired right back by picking into [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2065638#osu/4320729), winning it in a convincing fashion. Poland's next pick, [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388219#osu/5168184), followed in the footsteps of NM5, with Canada taking an early advantage but struggling to maintain combo at the end — another 3-way break in the last seconds of the map was enough to shift the point in Poland's favor, this time by 19,382 points.

At this point, Canada chose to start picking into their best mod category: the Free Mod pool. They started off with [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2139515#osu/4502914) and put on a masterclass — almost a 700,000 point difference off of very strong scores from the entire roster. Poland fired back with the precision pick of [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388196#osu/5168155), securing their own convincing win by 641,765 points with ::{ flag=PL }:: [Eirra](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3493804)'s 971,353 FC leading the way.

The antimod [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388329#osu/5168342) pick was Canada's next choice. Both teams' No Mod players, ::{ flag=CA }:: [yip](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5177569) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [szedis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14282987), put up solid scores in their own right, but the veteran ::{ flag=CA }:: [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) stole the show, holding exactly one thousand combo with HDHR for a score of 706,629 and securing his team the point. The follow-up [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2107364#osu/4494080) pick went in Poland's favor, with ::{ flag=PL }:: [szedis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14282987) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Kosiarek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9086565) both getting solid scores of over 650,000 points.

The final Free Mod pick for Canada in [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388222#osu/5168188) went similarly to their prior picks. ::{ flag=CA }:: [Juan Dario](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16529875) (a.k.a. Wanderio) and ::{ flag=CA }:: [Zucchiniii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13959253) secured the win with scores of 625,453 and 622,086 on No Mod and Hidden respectively. Poland, following in the footsteps of their earlier HR2 pick, ventured into [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2021678#osu/4261090). ::{ flag=PL }:: [Kosiarek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9086565) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [Asriel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11308471) both delivered 1-miss scores of 658,544 and 589,563, securing Poland match point at 6–4.

By this point, it looked like the Canadian NM4 pick was coming back to bite them, as both teams traded their respective picks outside of that. Canada continued that trend with [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388336#osu/5168351), winning off of a consistent team performance. Poland, seeing that HR2 and HR3 went well for them, had their final pick be [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388141#osu/5168010). Unlike the prior two maps, however, Canada took a solid advantage at the halfway point and never let go. ::{ flag=CA }:: [Juan Dario](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16529875) helped push their team to a tiebreaker with a massive 665,025 score, holding an FC for most of the map.

It all came down to the tiebreaker. Poland and Canada were neck-and-neck for the first few minutes of the map. However, by the halfway point, Canada started to run away with it. ::{ flag=CA }:: [Juan Dario](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16529875) and ::{ flag=CA }:: [Birchman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10676573) held crucial combos, countering a similar combo from ::{ flag=PL }:: [szedis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14282987) on the side of Poland. Once Canada had built their lead, it never went away, and they won the tiebreaker by 221,129 points, securing them the spot in the Grand Finals.

</div>

Unfortunately, Canada's run would meet a swift end during their rematch against the United States. The Americans put their foot on the gas pedal and never let up, winning 7–0 in a dominating fashion. ::{ flag=US }:: [rng_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9265990) led the way with standout scores of 807,904 on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2389014#osu/5169951) and 802,910 on [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388276#osu/5168274), countering ::{ flag=CA }:: [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578)'s similarly impressive scores of 769,565 and 735,014 respectively. ::{ flag=CA }:: [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) also scored a ridiculous 722,439 with Hidden on [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388222#osu/5168188), but unfortunately, the United States' overall team consistency, backed by ::{ flag=US }:: [LUNAISTABBY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4673649) (a.k.a. -Schwarts) taking advantage of the EZ multiplier of 2.4x on the map to secure 609,091 points, was too much to overcome by himself.

## Match highlights

### Quarterfinals: ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=FR }:: France

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

</div>

What took place in the Quarterfinals weekend was perhaps the greatest clash of pure firepower in this iteration of the 4 Digit World Cup: a match between the 9th-seeded France and the 1st-seeded United States.

Going into this match, the average viewer likely expected this match to be a rout in favour of the two-time defending champion United States, whose roster had not lost a match since 2022. The first three maps of this matchup would support this outcome, with a decisive 662,297 victory on their first pick of [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2377013#osu/5135263), a 974,280 break point on France's first pick of [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2377223#osu/5135786), and an overwhelming 1.2 million score gap on their second pick of [NM6](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/481703#osu/1430354). ::{ flag=US }:: [rng_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9265990) led the way for the Americans with FCs on HD2 and DT4, with the gimmick core of ::{ flag=US }:: [BATBALL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15173952), ::{ flag=US }:: [LUNAISTABBY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4673649) (a.k.a. -Schwarts) and ::{ flag=US }:: [toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) returning the favour on NM5. This tidal wave of American momentum seemed to be enough for them to coast to an easy win for the rest of the match, right? That would have been true in most matchups for them, but this French team was different. As their coach and 4WC commentator ::{ flag=FR }:: [Subaru_Arima](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11273062) boldly claimed in the prediction stream prior to the tournament, "they wouldn't go down so easily".

The French counter-attack came in the form of alt and tech, sparked by a stunning 3-way FC and victory on their own [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2377170#osu/5135631) pick by ::{ flag=FR }:: [calangi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7810180), ::{ flag=FR }:: [fiaee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10325072) and ::{ flag=FR }:: [lonq noir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14165027). The United States followed by picking [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2377026#osu/5135285), which saw ::{ flag=FR }:: [lonq noir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14165027) carry a 262,791 victory for France, matching ::{ flag=US }:: [rng_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9265990)'s FC on the other side. France used their next pick on [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2042527#osu/4262164), in which ::{ flag=FR }:: [calangi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7810180) clocked a 5x100 FC along with teammates who outscored three of the four Americans for a 1.1 million score victory. Shockingly, the United States decided to use their fourth pick on [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2322063#osu/4975164), another alt map. Despite great efforts from ::{ flag=US }:: [LUNAISTABBY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4673649) and ::{ flag=US }:: [rng_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9265990), France nearly repeated the scenario from NM3 with three scores above 800,000 being enough to hold off the Americans for another break point.

In the blink of an eye, the momentum was now squarely on the side of France, who had rattled off 4 straight points and now had the opportunity to use their fourth pick to reach match point and potentially hand the United States their first loss in three years. They selected [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2373888#osu/5126280), which on paper was a great pick, being the final tech map in a matchup where they had won the other two. The United States, however, snapped right back with a ::{ flag=US }:: [LUNAISTABBY](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4673649) FC and high supporting scores granting them a break point with a wide margin of 959,711. Coming from a 4–4 tie, they then reached match point by picking the anti-mod [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2210416#osu/5132658) and dominating France with another nearly 1 million point difference.

It was now France's final pick. With pressure at an all-time high, they decided to stake their winners' bracket lives on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1262817#osu/2639476), a hybrid map of precision and flow aim alt. The map was close until the very end, with ::{ flag=US }:: [rng_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9265990) and ::{ flag=FR }:: [Draxarta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11129041) matching FCs, supported by ::{ flag=US }:: [Uzumaki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13310147) and ::{ flag=FR }:: [fiaee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10325072) matching chokes, but ultimately the supporting scores for the Americans were better as they finished off the French team on a nail-biting 78,969-point victory.

Both teams played incredibly well this match, with the United States team achieving the top score of the weekend on 5/6 of their points, and the French team doing so on 3/4 of theirs. Besides the final map, most picks in this match were won in dominant fashion, with only 2 other picks being decided by a margin of 450,000 or below, and many being close to 1 million — an extremely rare statistic for a match that finished at 6–4.

### Semifinals: ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany vs. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3qqffDMWZg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Moving into the Semifinals weekend, the 2nd-seeded Germany, after their unexpected loss against Sweden in the previous week, had to face off against the 17th-seeded Indonesian roster to avoid being eliminated.

Indonesia, the dark horse of this match, started off strong by stealing Germany's [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2380996#osu/5150032) pick, where ::{ flag=ID }:: [Rin Kokonoe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11091594) (a.k.a. ThatNOOBguy) managed to outlast ::{ flag=DE }:: [kittenfrost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11234706) (a.k.a. ZeitFrost) with a 1,126,633 FC, resulting in the first break point of the match. Germany responded back with equal power, taking a break point of their own on Indonesia's [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2380835#osu/5146682) pick, tying the game 1–1.

Germany's next pick of [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2226198#osu/4722524), one of the hardest maps in the pool, attempted to capitalise on the skill cap advantage over Indonesia. However, ::{ flag=ID }:: [salt and honey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688737) had another plan in mind, pulling out a crucial 971,689 Hidden FC to secure Indonesia another break point. This enabled the Indonesians to finally consolidate and end the streak of break points on [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2040149#osu/4255853), the awkward aim map of the pool, thanks to ::{ flag=ID }:: [FAW](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11070577)'s 870,256 near-FC with Easy. Powered by the momentum, Indonesia took yet another break point on [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1851103#osu/3802734), putting Germany into an insanely dangerous scoreline of 1–4, without having won any of their own picks so far.

After a few more traded break points on [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1674871#osu/3421429) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1945323#osu/4144405) and with a scoreline of 2–5, Germany was moments away from facing elimination. Miraculously, with a point difference of just 14,116, they delayed this fate by taking Indonesia's [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/375956#osu/823257) pick despite a shaky ending, resulting in the 7th break point of the match. A subsequent win on [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1853565#osu/3808761) placed the scoreline at 4–5, with Indonesia having the choice for the last pick of the match.

That last pick, and the last chance for Germany to force the tiebreaker, ended up being [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2381120#osu/5147502), the precision pick. Despite best efforts and a stellar 856,063 reverse choke from ::{ flag=DE }:: [stellasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8508931), Germany failed to pull back the score by just 8,686 points. As such, Indonesia had eliminated the 2nd-seed powerhouse of Germany from 4WC, finishing the biggest upset of the tournament.

[hav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14100781) placed 3rd in 4WC 2025 as a member of the Polish team, achieving their best finish so far.

Hii!! I'm hav, previously known as cyanai. I've been casually playing tournaments since 2021, but began taking them more seriously in the latter half of 2023. You'll mostly see me shine on speed, hidden, reading, and unconventional maps in general.

Congratulations on making it to the podium! What would you say were the key factors for Poland's improvement from last year's 4th place?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14100781" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/hav.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14100781">hav</a></p>

I'd say the biggest factor was simply the team's overall improvement between 2024 and 2025. We all grew as players and worked on our weaker skillsets after last year's run, which added a lot of depth to the lineup.

Another key factor, just as important in my opinion, was bringing in [Kuba -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9322480) and [BadAimBoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7009485), two very solid tapping players. In 2024, our tapping roster consisted of just me, [szedis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14282987), and [hedayo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9323821) — we never really had a comfortable fourth player. It was our weakest skillset that year by a significant margin, but with their addition, we turned our biggest weakness into arguably our biggest strength. What used to be a skillset we dreaded and tried to avoid as much as possible became a core part of our picking strategy.

Your lower bracket Grand Finals match against Canada went all the way to tiebreaker, so clearly both teams were evenly matched against each other. Were you prepared to put up a fight against the United States in the event you would have won that tiebreaker?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14100781" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/hav.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14100781">hav</a></p>

It's hard to think of the hypothetical, but if we had won that tiebreaker, I think we definitely could've put up a fight. Our match against the United States in Finals gave us quite a bit of insight and confidence, since we managed to score 3 points and kept the match close with some nail-biters despite missing BadAimBoi, who was at a fan convention and couldn't show up. It boosted our morale going into Grand Finals knowing we had some potential even without a full roster.

We had some silly misspicks and lowrolls against Canada, but we were confident we could fix those if we got the chance to play the United States. That said, the Americans played insanely well, way better than we expected them to. If even a team as strong as Canada got swept, I don't think we could've done much more. Nevertheless, I'm very content with our 3rd place finish this year. We gave it our all and that's all that matters in the long run!!

Poland has been on an upward trend in 4WC. Do you think the potential inclusion of [BWS](/wiki/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding) in future iterations would affect your team better or worse than others?

As it stands, we'd lose a big portion of our core roster with BWS involved: [szedis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14282987), [eniu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5472693), [Asriel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11308471), and most likely [Kosiarek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9086565) as he's been planning on ranking up soon. It'd be a big loss, but there are a lot of up-and-coming faces in the Polish 4 digit scene to help fill those gaps. [squarem](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4740837) is one of the standouts, and I'm sure others will show up in due time, so I believe we'd be able to rebuild pretty well.

As for how we'd compare to other teams, right now it's hard to say. Most of the top contenders would take a big hit and have to rebuild, some nearly from scratch. From what I've seen, the United States would get hit the hardest, losing more than half of their current roster, so it'd definitely shake things up and level the playing field a bit. Only time will really tell how it all plays out.

[Pezz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10651106) (a.k.a. Godskin Noble), after winning the [2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1761090?n=1) and [2024](/wiki/Tournaments/4WC/2024) iterations of 4WC, turned to mappooling to continue his involvement with the series.

While the US team has stayed mostly the same for the past 3 years of their dominance, this time you ranked up and joined as a mappool selector. Has the commitment to mappooling opened some new views you never got as a player? Do you think the vast experience you have as a player helps in mappooling?

While I'm no stranger to pooling, I've never been a part of a project that I had participated in the past. Going from playing two years in a row to pooling was a super interesting experience. It helped knowing almost everyone on the team prior, but joining the pooling team, more than anything, showed me how much people really care about the project. I always found myself peeping other staff channels to see what was going on and without fail saw passionate individuals who really cared about the project. From the "BWS poll incident" to Grands Finals, people kept their passion the entire way through, and that's not something you get in many other places.

As a player it's easy to see one or two simple mistakes and assume people don't really care, but looking at it from a staff/pooler perspective, it was never that simple, which was really interesting to see. The moment you step behind the scenes, everything becomes so much brighter and clearer. As for pooling, I would say my extended experience as a player is, without a doubt, very helpful. It helps in a few key areas that I think more inexperienced poolers really struggle with. It really helps you know what kind of maps are fun to play in match, it helps a ton with difficulty balancing for maps, it helps give a varied library of maps to choose from, and it helps empathize with the many concerns that arise in the infamous "mappool feedback" channels. It's like seeing a double rainbow — there are always more layers to appreciate than what first meets the eye.

How does mappooling for a world cup-style tournament, especially when accompanied by current OWC and LGA mappooler [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656), differ from other tournaments?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10651106" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Godskin_Noble.jpg')"></a>

Well, it really depends on the tournament. I think at this point I've been in just about every scenario you can imagine, from random tournaments with only a single pooler and playtester, to now 4WC with an extensive list of playtesters. I think the most significant thing you get in an environment like this is many different perspectives, and people who consistently show up week after week. With twenty plus playtesters, you're able to capture much better how the playerbase will actually react to certain maps, especially when compared to more "humble" tournaments.

Joining the team was a bit intimidating at first, given it was the most extensive staff and custom mapper list I had ever seen or been a part of, but I think [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656) specifically really deserves a special shoutout for his mentality regarding the team. The way he makes everyone feel welcome really lets their talents sparkle. Thankfully, as I have staffed with and for him plenty of times in the past, he himself wasn't intimidating, but the prospect of pooling for a community world cup still was. chiv himself really empathized with a new member's perspective and made sure people like me, who had never staffed for such tournaments before, were able to freely express their ideas without the worry of public outrage. I think that was the single most impactful thing in how easy it ended up being to integrate into the staff team and pump out some juicers. The light finds its way, you know?

Your inclusion to the pooling team coincided with a bit of an ideology shift in pooling compared to the 2 years you played, including a reduction in difficulty, which clearly didn't affect the US. How do you personally feel about this year's pools compared to previous iterations?

I think this iteration's pools compared to last felt more like "4WC". The previous two iterations I played in, at least to me, both felt like "3WC but for 4 digits". This iteration, however, felt a lot more fitting. I think both the lowering in difficulty and map selection went into this feeling, and I'm proud of what we ended up with. Everything just illuminated perfectly this time around. Shine on!

Do you have any advice for new faces looking to get into mappooling?

While I could answer this with so many different things, truthfully speaking I think the most important part for any new pooler is to enjoy doing it and be proud of what you create. I could tell you to look at the tools available, join [poolingcore](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers#tournaments), get a more experienced pooler to look over what you do, but none of that is as important as having fun and liking the pools you put out. Stay positive!
