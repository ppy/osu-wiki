## Beatmapping

### Limitation

A *limitation* is our fancy word for a contest gimmick. We do these to keep maps for this contest fresh and (hopefully) interesting to map!

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Morusya](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=13681464) (for osu!catch) or [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063) (for osu!mania).

#### osu!catch

The fundamental feature of osu!catch maps is movement laterally on the playfield. So, of course, we're going to restrict that.

This month's limitation:

- **Objects must be placed only on the left (`x:0` to `x:256`) or the right side (`x:256` to `x:512`) of the playfield.**
- **You can alternate which side of the playfield your objects are on every 4, 8, or 16 measures of music.**

Take a look at [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/44807) or [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/694200#osu/1468735) for an idea of how this could work!

#### osu!mania

You might have heard that the osu!mania 7K World Cup ended in February. You were wrong. It's happening *right now*, and you're part of the mappooling team!

For this month's contest, design a **7K map** with a style that fits a **round and category (a.k.a. "slot") from [the latest osu!mania 7K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K)**. Keep these in mind:

- **Mappers must choose a *round* between "Round of 32" and "Finals".** No Grand Finals–tier maps, sorry.
- **Mappers must choose a beatmap *category* used in the World Cup.** All categories are okay, excluding "fast chordstream" (RC6) and "chordjack" (RC3).
- **Submissions must have the round and category in their tags.** This allows judges to contextualise what they're judging!

To top things off, this month's judges are seasoned 7K mappoolers and mappers!

Additionally, we're collaborating with the [7K GLOBAL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2065328?n=1) community this time. The best submission from each slot — as determined by the judges — will be pooled into the 7K GLOBAL event, and their mappers will be eligible for extra rewards!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!
