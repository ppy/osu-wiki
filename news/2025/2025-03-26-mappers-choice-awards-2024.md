## A Year in Mapping update

As we look back on 2024, the countless memories left behind in the community remain fresh in our minds. Now, an even deeper dive into the data and stats behind 2024's mapping trends awaits you in **A Year In Mapping (AYIM) 2024**! For those who don't know, **A Year in Mapping** serves as the mapping community's annual report, presenting the most comprehensive and exciting stats of the past year. Want to know how many Ranked maps and mappers each mode had, or perhaps which songs and artists made the biggest impact on the community this year? It's all inside AYIM — [**click here to view the most comprehensive and exciting stats of 2024!**](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/aa599b20-f74b-4699-9e69-504f542de5aa/page/hj1uB?s=vvKt9IOmetM)

The previous MCA AYIM organisers have decided to not continue their service, and after some discussion, we decided to use an external source to help us resume AYIM! [YamYA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4470854) has been hosting their own iteration of AYIM for the past couple of years, and as such, we've decided to promote their work with all credit going to them.
