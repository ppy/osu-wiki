## Finalists

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/KAITO%20thighs.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/KAITO%20thighs.png)

Inviting **1,101** voters to the Halloween party, [**KAITO thighs**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) (a.k.a. Dreamxiety), takes the cake with another win this year! Their illustriously drawn vampire pippi is here to celebrate with cake and pumpkins... or maybe she's out for someone's blood instead.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/LeeNarie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/LeeNarie.jpg)

[**LeeNarie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2667849) showed **1,030** tech enthusiasts a scene of Mari and Mocha's souls at the mercy of digital witch pippi and her sidekick Taikonator 3000: trapped in a corrupt graveyard of buggy hitboxes, constant crashes, trees long gone, illegal cookie templates and eerie amalgamations. This unique and modern take on horror earned the entry second place, well done!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/Triantafyllia.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/Triantafyllia.png)

**976** literature lovers saw [**Triantafyllia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17084594)'s artwork of Alisa in Wonderland complete with rabbits, sweets and smiles. While coffees were spilt and magic mirrors broken, this entry was fortunate enough to earn third place and, for the duration of Halloween, a place in on osu!'s main menu.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/Arushii.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/Arushii.jpg)

**871** people learned from [**Arushii**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15664628)'s sunset shot that pippi (this time the goat) once visited a place oddly reminiscent of the scarlet fields of Caelid. We reckon half were hit by the mortifying memories such a place normally imprints on visitors, while half were impressed by the imposing architecture, majestic lighting and sombre colours.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/year-bear.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/year-bear.png)

[**year-bear**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12178754) hit **844** exorcists with a flurry of colours depicting the cute spirits of pippi, Mocha, Mari and Chirou. It was super effective, and after a quick defeat by adorableness, they left a bunch of shiny votes for our osu! cast to happily collect.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/mugcake.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/mugcake.png)

A surprised Mocha and an amused pippi experienced a mysterious phenomenon while going to play tricks during the night. It seems [**mugcake**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16190355) drew them flying wisps to carry the treats right to them! **814** trick-and-treaters were jealous of the efficiency.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/soncak.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/soncak.png)

[**soncak**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3866821) gave pippi a supercharged broom that was practically made for zipping across pixelated forest skies, to the great upset of scientist Mocha and Taikonator 3000 (LVL 3000 area boss). At least, that might be what's going on. The cool hijinks though, are real, and were enough to charm **802** adventurous spirits.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/Arehandotsu.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/Arehandotsu.png)

[**Arehandotsu**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18540068) sent a picture of an adorable Chirou and a charming pippi visiting the taiko gravestone, reaching **768** viewers on the art contest voting page. Despite the ominous implication, we'd like to clarify that the game mode is *not* in fact dead (yet), despite the numerous internal proposals for its deletion.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/Ikarii.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/Ikarii.png)

We're back to tricks and treats with pippi and Mocha, this time with lots more treats. [**Ikarii**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8806199)'s illustration of their successful night went straight into the hearts of **764** osu! residents.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/Ferineon.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/Ferineon.jpg)

**722** of you were enamoured by [**Ferineon**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23930728)'s artwork of Mocha by the night, the water and the roses. As simple as that.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/sardines.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/sardines.jpg)

[**sardines**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16247587)' vampire Yuzu in a monochromatic world of roses, butterflies and mirrors captured **661** onlookers by the unique style and chaotic vibe.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/Christi_Anna.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/Christi_Anna.png)

[**Christi_Anna**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11016739)'s pippi wrote her ticket to the main menu in blood with **649** ~~victims~~ contributors to her success and oh dear why are there skeletons on the floor and oh crap who is that behind her OH NO WHY IS SHE LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/wiwit.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/wiwit.png)

[**wiwit**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10610309)'s intimidating pixel art of pippi and her monochrome friend (and Don) compelled **633** of you to vote for their harrowing entry, which rightfully soared to the winning spots.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/h3p0.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/h3p0.png)

[**h3p0**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15875092)'s rendition of pippi the dark angel and Mocha the witch resting on a full moon night caught the attention of **598** individuals who understood all the references of various sizes sprawled throughout this entry.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/broken-bun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/broken-bun.png)

[**broken-bun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14728798) entered the contest with a spooky Chirou puppet. They managed a performance that wowed **577** audience members, enough to secure a spot on the main menu!

### peppy's Picks

The true horror of Halloween comes from only having 15 votes to pick entries in osu! art contests. With that in mind, a handful of entries traditionally get picked by the game's lead developer [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2), and this time is no different:

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/muclyhere.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/muclyhere.png)

[**muclyhere**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/36519053) went for tried and true formulas: mummies and maids. With the combination of ideas, they managed to add the finishing touches in style.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/izo001.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/izo001.png)

[**izo001**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/38565482)'s pippi on a broom and mellow skies shine joy and warmth at our eyes. This one was too good to pass up on.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/FizzyGummi.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/FizzyGummi.png)

[**FizzyGummi**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29628103) entered the stage with Mani playing macabre notes under the bleeding Moon. Don seems to think the tunes could be more pleasant to the ears.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/-%20Y%20u%20m%20i%20J%20i-.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/-%20Y%20u%20m%20i%20J%20i-.jpg)

[**- Y u m i J i-**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7656048)'s Mocha and pippi are geared up for the Halloween festival, making sure to bring a feline friend and a youkai umbrella to prepare for all eventualities.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/banners/aquapoki.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/winners/aquapoki.png)

[**aquapoki**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28078727) keeps things simple with a cutesy pippi ghost gunning to spook whoever dares to open the game at the wrong time.

As always, thank you to all artists for participating, both to the new faces and returning artists alike! It's always impressive to see the new and unique ideas every season.

You'll see all the winning entries shown above on the main menu (unless you've turned off seasonal backgrounds in the settings (how could you)). If you don't see your favourite entry, feel free to [download a zip file containing all entries of the Halloween 2025 Fanart Contest here](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/260/Halloween2025FanartSubmissions.zip)! With so many quality entries, it would be a shame to see them unused, even if they didn't make the cut in the community voting.

If you have [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter), you can drag and drop any image into the game's main menu to set it as the background (by itself — it won't join the others in the rotation). Even if you don't have an osu!supporter tag active, the **top 4 entries** will be available as part of the selection of **default profile page banners** until the end of the next art contest (click the pen icon at the bottom right of your profile cover).

Of course, all vote counts and placements are also visible on the [contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/260).

Happy Halloween and see you next time!
