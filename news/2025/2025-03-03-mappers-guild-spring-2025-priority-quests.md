Creativity thrives on constraints, and the creative side of osu! mapping is no exception. Rethink how you map with the Mappers' Guild's newest quests!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

It's official: a new batch of [**Mappers' Guild**](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) quests have dropped, providing mappers with ways to explore their circle/drum/fruit/key-based capabilities.

In case you're out of the loop, the **Mappers' Guild** is an MMO-inspired mapping system surrounding osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists). Mappers can [earn rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for completing mapping-related tasks, like ranking maps, participating in contests, and collaborating on [quests](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#quests) (which is what this article is about!).

The Mappers' Guild is open to mappers of any skill level, including those without Ranked maps! See [the system's website](https://mappersguild.com/) or the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)'s `#mappers-guild` channel for details!

## What are priority quests?

- **Anyone can participate in [priority quests](https://mappersguild.com/missions).** Unlike [normal quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests), you don't need to claim priority quests in advance.
- **Quests are tiered by difficulty:**
  - Tier 1 ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png) (easiest, lowest reward)
  - Tier 2 ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)
  - Tier 3 ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)
  - Tier 4 ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png) (hardest, highest reward)
- **Multiple users can complete the same quest**. Most of the time, anyone who accomplishes the quest's objective before the deadline is eligible.

By completing priority quests, you can earn some special rewards too:

- All the usual [Mappers' Guild rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for ranking beatmaps
- A [**customised keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) based on a pattern in your map
- A profile badge upon completing 3 priority quests

## New priority quests

**6** new quests have just been added to the [priority quest listing](https://mappersguild.com/missions), all of which will be open to mappers until **June 21, 2025**!

Below is an overview of each quest. If any are confusing, feel free to ask questions in the comments or directly to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418). Be sure to check the quest pages for additional requirements!

### [Point of entry](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=67c3b7f965c8e39f49e79240) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

When installing osu! for the first time, your client can automatically fill your library with a few maps. We call these "bundled maps", which are randomly selected from a pool of curated Featured Artist maps.

**Your goal is to create a map eligible for the bundled map pool!** This has a lot of weirdly specific requirements detailed [here](https://github.com/bdach/osu/blob/master/osu.Game/Beatmaps/Drawables/BundledBeatmapDownloader.cs#L134-L152).

### [osu!original expansion v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=67c3b7b665c8e39f49e7923c) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

Most of the [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals) in osu!'s music library come from the World Cups. Many of those songs don't reach players beyond their initial mode, so let's change that.

**Rank a map of any World Cup osu! original in a game mode that it wasn't created for!**

### [Monthly Beatmapping Contest returns v3](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=67c3b83765c8e39f49e79244) ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)

**Rank a map from any of your [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) submissions.**

If you've never made a map for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest, the next iteration is unsurprisingly coming within the next month!

### [Celestial manipulator](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=67c3b88065c8e39f49e79248) ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)

As mappers gain more experience, they understand the depths of osu!'s star rating systems more deeply than anyone reasonably should. It's time to make use of that experience.

**Create a spread using any [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) with at least 5 difficulties, where each difficulty's star rating is exactly 1.0 apart at the time it's Ranked.**

### [Classified: Artist edition](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=67c3b8e565c8e39f49e7925f) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

This quest goes back to the roots of the Mappers' Guild: **making maps for upcoming Featured Artists**.

Your goal is to create and rank a map for it to be showcased in the artist's upcoming announcement! To participate in this quest, the first step is to select an artist from the [quest page](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=67c3b8e565c8e39f49e7925f).

Unlike previous Classified quests, this one gives you a decent selection upfront. You're given all available songs for an upcoming artist, and your goal is to create and rank a map for any of them. If all goes well, your map will be showcased in the artist's announcement!

For confidentiality reasons, this quest is only open to experienced Mappers' Guild members.

### [The Hurdle v4](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=67c3b8b965c8e39f49e7925b) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

If you're a new mapper, you don't need extra restrictions on your creativity. Making a map is tough enough on its own.

This quest is simple: **create and rank your first beatmap!**

That's it for now! If you've made it this far, we trust you're at least a little bit interested in mapping, so [scroll through the new priority quests](https://mappersguild.com/missions) and challenge your creativity.

Of course, if you need help with any of your Mappers' Guild–related maps, feel free to reach out in the `#mappers-guild` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)!

Have fun mapping!
