**Naikou** journeys from tournament mappools to our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/471/header.jpg)

Anyone following osu!'s community tournament scene has already heard [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) by **Naikou**. Between *5 Digit World Cup*, *osu!mania Squid Game*, *Couls scuffed overskilled 5 digit cup*, and *4 Digit Player Tournament*, **Naikou**'s complex DTM tunes have made their impact on osu!, so now they're officially part of the game!

A total of **6** tracks can be found on [**Naikou**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/471), each pre-timed and ready for mapping (which is especially good in this case — a bunch of these tracks have sections with different tempos!).

Inspired by the likes of [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31), [*Silentroom*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/92), [*Kou!*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/383), and *Virtual Riot*, the only way to understand **Naikou**'s sound is to hear it for yourself:
