Sprouting from an interest in *Dance Dance Revolution* games as a kid, **Xeven** grew a fondness for songs by iconic creators in the scene like [t+pazolite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/396), [Kobaryo](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/96), [xi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/727), and [Camellia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31), leading to **Xeven**'s own brand of full flavour music!

Topping out at **9** tracks, [**Xeven**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/475) has everything you could ever ask for (assuming your sole desire is awesome music to map, of course).

Check everything out:
