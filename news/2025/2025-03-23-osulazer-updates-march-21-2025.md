A new osu!(lazer) update is delivered by a soft spring breeze.

Mother Nature is slowly rolling out the new spring 2025 update, featuring warmer weather, more sun, and more greenery all across the board! Despite all of graphical and weather updates, the osu! developers still made time to focus and drop an update of their own for the osu! community.

### Editor

- **The "discard unsaved changes" operation has been added to the editor.** Sometimes those new changes you've made just don't work out.
- **A new skinnable Kiai/star fountain sound effect has been added.** The new sound effect can be heard on the osu! argon skins, and you can use `fountain-shoot.wav` to place a sound of your own!

- **Editor grid spacing can now be set up to 256 pixels.** Hate the editor grid? You can now get rid of it entirely.
- **Right-click-for-new-combo and right-click-delete combinations have been added back in object placement mode.** Deleting objects has never been so easy. While in selection mode, you'll still have to hold `Shift` to delete things quickly due to regular right-click opening a context menu.

### Gameplay

- **Beatmap information is now shown in the window title when playing or editing a beatmap.** This might go unnoticed by the majority, but those who do notice it will appreciate it.
- **The freestyle multiplayer results screen now shows the correct beatmap details for all users.** Previously it showed the same beatmap for everyone, regardless of the game mode selected.
- **Minor design adjustments have been made for mobile gameplay.** The osu!mania mobile layout can now be customised, and a fix was rolled out for osu!taiko since the playfield was more zoomed-in than needed, causing less objects to be seen at once.

- **The difficulty settings in mod select are now properly highlighted for all applicable mods.** On some mods (Hard Rock being an example), you weren't able to see clearly that they change difficulty settings such as OD (overall difficulty) and AR (approach rate) until this update.

### Other

- **Minor design adjustments have been made to the leaderboards and multiplayer lounge.** The scale of rooms in multiplayer lounge has been lowered, and the leaderboard was adjusted slightly, although a major redesign of the whole song select screen is slated for next release (fingers crossed).
- **The taskbar will now flash when a multiplayer game starts.** This is a life-saver for those who constantly tab out of the game.
- **Beatmap user tags have been added, along with the ability to vote on them after completing a play.** With the shutdown of [apollodw](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9558549)'s [OMDB](https://omdb.nyahh.net/), the various tags have been ported over to the game itself, and anyone who sets a play over a certain threshold will be able to vote on the tags.

- **The tip pressure threshold is now configurable in the tablet settings.** This can both serve as a utility for niche play styles, or it might give a dying tablet some extra life span.
- **Team beatmap leaderboards have been added.** You can now compete exclusively with your osu teammates!
- **More functionality has been added upon right-clicking a user in the chat window.** You can now right-click on anyone in chat to spectate them, or invite them to your multiplayer room.
