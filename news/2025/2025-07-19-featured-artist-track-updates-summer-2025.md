If looking at the editor only makes you confused, you have your whole summer vacation to learn how to create maps. With over **70** new tracks to choose from, the song for your first map might be here!

You're surely familiar with osu!'s [Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) already. We have hundreds of artists onboard, and more coming each weekend. This weekend however, we're skipping a new artist addition in favour of adding more tracks to our oldies' listings.

Any new songs are marked with a **NEW** icon on the Featured Artist listing.

## [Aoi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/183)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/183/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/183)

When [**Aoi**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/183) created [Welkius](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2321296) for this year's 7K osu!mania World Cup, we also picked up **Agapitos**. Just like every other track by **Aoi**, it's worth a listen.

### Aoi - Agapitos

## [Corsace](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/381)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/381/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/381)

[**Corsace**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/381) isn't exactly a "Featured Artist", but we're treating them like one anyway. For last year's *Corsace Open*, we helped the tournament team with their commissioned tracks, and now those tracks are part of **Corsace**'s and the [osu! community music](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/462)'s tracklists!

Each of the tournament's maps can be played here:

[**cygnus**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359) is one of osu!'s most prolific Featured Artists. While they started out with around 20 tracks on their listing, they've been consistently dropping new tracks onto osu!'s metaphorical lap, surpassing 100 total tracks as of today's update!

A few tracks are below, but the rest can be found on [**cygnus**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359):

## [meganeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/75)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/75/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/75)

[**meganeko**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/75)'s music has a reputation for driving osu! players feral (in the best way possible). To satisfy your cravings, we've snagged 7 more tracks for their listing! Here are a few to peek at, and the rest can be found on [**meganeko**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/75):

### meganeko - The Cyber Grind

Three maps are on the docket:

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/175/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/175)

Sometimes you just need one more track to round out a listing. That's why we picked [**Pratanallis**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/175)'s *Black Berserker*.

## [Release Hallucination](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/194)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/194/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/194)

While most of you may recognise [**Release Hallucination**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/194) for their original track *VANITAS* for the *osu! World Cup 2023*, the band made another track for an osu! event one year later. *ASTERIA* from *Sidi's Winter Invitational* is officially part of osu!.

### [Release Hallucination - ASTERIA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2301277) mapped by [Aeril](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4334976) and [FrenZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9531903)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/185/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/185)

osu! wouldn't be a rhythm game without music like what [**seatrus**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/185) provides. If technical complexity is what you're looking for, one of the 8 new tracks on [**seatrus**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/185) will be your next map. Here are a few samples:

[Veil of Ash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391791) debuted just a few weeks ago as one of this year's osu!catch original tracks, but that's not the end of what [**Symholic**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/130) has to offer. We have two extra tracks for their listing:

## [Tenchio](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/265)

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/265/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/265)

We're not entirely sure what genres classify [**Tenchio**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/265)'s music, but we're confident that it's awesome, and that's why osu! players are getting more of it. This batch includes **Tenchio**'s whole album *Brain Emo*, plus two extra tracks!

Everything is on [**Tenchio**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/265), but you can experience some tracks here too:
