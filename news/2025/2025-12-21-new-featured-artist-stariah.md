The star of our Featured Artist catalogue has arrived!

Virtual electronic music artist **Stariah** made their musical debut in early 2024, and has been on an exponential rise ever since. Starting with a humble remix, followed by a single, then a full-length album released under renowned label *Reinelex Records*, **Stariah** has thoroughly demonstrated their own expertise in the modern electronic space, and now they're sharing that aptitude with osu!.

It's cold outside. Get a hot cup of cocoa and spend a bit of your holiday in the editor. [**Stariah**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/517) has a grand total of **16** tracks, all pre-timed for your mapping convenience!

These previews are bound to inspire something in your circle-consumed creative cortex:
