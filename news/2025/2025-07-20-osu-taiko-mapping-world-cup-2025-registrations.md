Da-don! After a successful launch last year the osu!taiko Mapping World Cup is back, bigger and better than before!

![](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2025/img/banner.jpg)

The osu!taiko Mapping World Cup is a country-based, multi-stage osu!taiko mapping contest. Countries will battle it out over multiple rounds of mapping, completing specific challenges along the way, to decide what country is the undisputed best at producing osu!taiko beatmaps.

Following feedback on last year's contest, this year's format will be less demanding in volume and provide with participating teams with more time to produce their maps. Specifics will be released when the contest starts but rest assured that this will be a blast!

Team sizes will range from 3 to 6 people, with the ability to have multiple teams per country depending on the amount of sign-ups. If there isn't a sufficient amount of people from a country to create a team, the registered participants will be combined with other participants from their geographical region in the same situation. The aim of this contest is to allow everyone to participate after all!

If you want to read more about the rules, contest format, schedule, and judging criteria, please check out this contest's [wiki page](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2025) and [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2101898) for more information.

## Registrations

Registrations are open from now until 00:00 (UTC) on August 17th! To register, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/poJrvrceL3E19bSE6), and join the contest's [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5ewzEEcUCB) to stay up to date with the latest news and announcements.

If you have issues with submitting your registration through the form, please send [ikin5050](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4007649) or [Yasuho](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=8458835) a message and they will sort things out for you.

After registrations close, the [organisation team](/wiki/Contests/TMWC/2024#organisation) will review all submissions, appoint captains of each country, and provide them a list of potential teammates to organise. If this person does not want to be captain, a replacement will be selected. If more than 6 people sign up for a single country, more than one team may participate and a captain will be delegated for each team.

Do note that it's required for the team captains to be present in the Discord server to keep up with any announcements or changes related to the contest.
