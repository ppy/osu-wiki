The first elimination round has been played, which means we'll be saying goodbye to a few of our valiant teams. Much like the previous round, the skill gap between teams is still fairly large, resulting in many one-sided victories. Still, we have a few exciting matches that we'd be foolish to miss the chance to retell.

## Round of 16 results

The Round of 16 had, surprisingly enough, 16 matches. Here are their outcomes all laid out:

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **Singapore** ::{ flag=SG }:: | **5** | 0 | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia |
| **Taiwan** ::{ flag=TW }:: | **5** | 0 | ::{ flag=TR }:: Türkiye |
| **United States** ::{ flag=US }:: | **5** | 0 | ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland |
| **Chile** ::{ flag=CL }:: | **5** | 4 | ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation |
| **Switzerland** ::{ flag=CH }:: | **5** | 1 | ::{ flag=MX }:: Mexico |
| Brazil ::{ flag=BR }:: | 0 | **5** | ::{ flag=CA }:: **Canada** |
| Argentina ::{ flag=AR }:: | 0 | **5** | ::{ flag=NZ }:: **New Zealand** |
| Australia ::{ flag=AU }:: | 2 | **5** | ::{ flag=MY }:: **Malaysia** |
| Italy ::{ flag=IT }:: | 2 | **5** | ::{ flag=HK }:: **Hong Kong** |
| **China** ::{ flag=CN }:: | **5** | 3 | ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom |
| Portugal ::{ flag=PT }:: | 0 | **5** | ::{ flag=FR }:: **France** |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **5** | 0 | ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam |
| **Japan** ::{ flag=JP }:: | **5** | 1 | ::{ flag=NL }:: Netherlands |
| Bulgaria ::{ flag=BG }:: | -1 | **5** | ::{ flag=PH }:: **Philippines** |
| Peru ::{ flag=PE }:: | 0 | **5** | ::{ flag=SK }:: **Slovakia** |
| Colombia ::{ flag=CO }:: | 1 | **5** | ::{ flag=PL }:: **Poland** |

This has been another weekend where the stronger teams have mostly stomped out the competition. Unfortunately for the losers' bracket teams, that also means we'll have to bid ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina, ::{ flag=BR }:: Brazil, ::{ flag=BG }:: Bulgaria, ::{ flag=CO }:: Colombia, ::{ flag=IT }:: Italy, ::{ flag=MX }:: Mexico, ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru and ::{ flag=PT }:: Portugal farewell from the osu!taiko World Cup 2025.

As a quick note, the "-1" in the results means that the opponent won by default, in this case because not enough team members were available to play.

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom

China has long been a strong and exciting team to follow in the World Cups, and last year the United Kingdom made history by securing a 2nd-place finish! This year, however, the United Kingdom, having lost many of its core players, dropped to the #10 seed from last year's #2. Even so, this match between China (#7) and the United Kingdom (#10) was far closer than many expected.

With China winning the roll, they narrowly beat the United Kingdom on their first pick, [nagiha - VALDeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343727#taiko/5038204) (NM2). However, the United Kingdom fired back, and proved they still had some firepower with a win on their own pick, [96-glass - Scooter Braza](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1732086#taiko/4489836) (NM3).

It became an intense battle where both teams kept trading points. China barely claimed victory on their second pick, [Eliminate - Elevator (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2010161#taiko/4182581) (NM4), with a 2,052 score difference, and all players full-comboing. Next up, the United Kingdom picked [seatrus - Diossido di Carbonio](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2068608#taiko/4328190) (HR1), and with a similar score difference, all players got a full-combo yet again. Not to mention ::{ flag=GB }:: [overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847) with the perfect score, securing their point! Quickly, China picked [haunt - song about love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2203014#taiko/4701577) (HD2). In what became something of a pattern, all players full-combo'd once again, with ::{ flag=GB }:: [My Angel Seia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17797595) getting a perfect score. Despite the United Kingdom's strong showing, China walked away with a win on their pick.

Both teams fiercely trading points, no one could predict this match from then on. The United Kingdom picked next, and a heated battle unfolded. With China scoring one fewer miss overall than the United Kingdom, they scored the first break point of the match on [minimum electric design - miscalc](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2322699#taiko/4977029) (DT2). With China at match point, the team picked [FRASER EDWARDS - The Heist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343737#taiko/5038222) (NM5). Potentially the last map of the match, the United Kingdom wasn't done yet. Against all odds, they stole China's pick with a razor-thin 127-point difference!

Now the United Kingdom's pick, they chose this week's osu! original, [Slax - Body to the Drum](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343891#taiko/5038601) (NM1). Even with ::{ flag=GB }:: [overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847) getting their second perfect score in the match, it was sadly not enough, and China secured the final point, winning the match 5–3, and sending the United Kingdom down to the loser's bracket.

### ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile vs. ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation

The idea of a "core player" is something that many will be familiar with, both players and viewers alike. Household names like ::{ flag=GB }:: [goheegy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8057655/taiko) or ::{ flag=TR }:: [frukoyurdakul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7612550) are spearheads that people might base their match predictions on. For Chile, you might consider their team captain, ::{ flag=CL }:: [Ulqui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669), to be that core player. But what happens when they're not around? This weekend we saw the meeting of the captainless Chile (#6) and the Russian Federation (#11). A match where 90.9% of pick'em voters had their hopes on Chile, perhaps unaware of their missing player.

The Chilean team immediately showed everyone that their core remains strong regardless of their roster with three fantastic full combos on their first pick, [haunt - song about love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2203014#taiko/4701577) (HD2). However, the Russian team was quick to prove that they too are a force to be reckoned with, claiming their own point on [nagiha - VALDeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343727#taiko/5038204) (NM2).

The Chileans showed off their mod prowess with a full team's worth of HDHR scores on [reysa - sometimes it's just a little sad to say goodbye](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343768#taiko/5038285) (FM2). Although the Russian team full-combo'd the map, all three only used HR, allowing Chile to secure their second point.

The teams kept trading points — Russia claimed [minimum electric design - miscalc](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2322699#taiko/4977029) (DT2), Chile repeated their three-way HDHR victory on [Zekk - Trinity Force](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2048882#taiko/4277827) (FM1) and Russia fired back with three identical scores on [seatrus - Diossido di Carbonio](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2068608#taiko/4328190) (HR1). It's definitely worth checking out.

Chile took the game to match point with an impressive 123,577-point win on [Eliminate - Elevator (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2010161#taiko/4182581) (NM4)... but there's a reason this match made it to the recap — one of them being Russia's incredible last-point clutch of a mere 3,002 points on [EVO - Kholod](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2155566#taiko/4713800) (HR2) bringing them to the first tiebreaker of the tournament, where all six performed impeccably — but one player went the extra mile, securing Chile's victory:

## Score highlights

One score stood out this weekend enough to be put on a tall pedestal, which should probably be obvious if you read the previous section:

- ::{ flag=CL }:: [chibamasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16067522/taiko)'s FC on [yax03 - 17 yo silly EDM artist from Japan vs. the World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2249855#taiko/4784566) (TB). It needs to be restated: going the extra mile and taking the challenge to the next level, they showed everyone why Chile deserved the win. Masterful HD gameplay and only four 100s later, chibamasu ended up with a full combo and a stunning score of 1,061,305.
