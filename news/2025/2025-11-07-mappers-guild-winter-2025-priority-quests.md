Once upon a time, you opened the osu! editor. Now look at how far you've come: you're exploring a niche within a niche within a niche by participating in this new batch of Mappers' Guild quests!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

The [**Mappers' Guild**](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) is an MMO-inspired mapping system surrounding osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists). Mappers (a.k.a. you) can [earn rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for completing mapping-related tasks, like ranking maps, participating in contests, and collaborating on [quests](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#quests).

The Mappers' Guild is open to mappers of any skill level, including those without Ranked maps! See [the system's website](https://mappersguild.com/) or the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)'s `#mappers-guild` channel for details.

## What are priority quests?

- **Anyone can participate in [priority quests](https://mappersguild.com/missions).** Unlike [normal quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests), you don't need to claim priority quests in advance.
- **Quests are tiered by difficulty:**
  - Tier 1 ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png) (easiest, lowest reward)
  - Tier 2 ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)
  - Tier 3 ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)
  - Tier 4 ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png) (hardest, highest reward)
- **Multiple users can complete the same quest.** Most of the time, anyone who accomplishes the quest's objective before the deadline is eligible.

By completing priority quests, you can earn some special rewards too:

- All the usual [Mappers' Guild rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for ranking beatmaps
- A [**customised keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) based on a pattern in your map
- A profile badge upon completing 3 priority quests

## New priority quests

You've made it to the important section.

**6** new quests have just been added to the [priority quest listing](https://mappersguild.com/missions)! These will be available until **February 23, 2026**.

Below is an overview of each quest. If any are confusing, feel free to ask questions in the comments or directly to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418). Be sure to check the quest pages for additional requirements!

### [A year of osu! originals v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be293c83d944d73db42a5) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

Every year, osu! coordinates a bunch of new songs for its annual world cups. Many of 2025's tracks haven't made it to the Ranked section yet (especially across all modes), so it's time to change that.

Your goal: create and rank a map of any song from 2025's osu! original world cup tracklist, so long as it's not already Ranked in your map's mode.

Use [this page](/wiki/osu!_originals#official-tournament-releases) to see which songs were created for 2025's world cups!

### [Homegrown](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be327c83d944d73db42eb) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

As a mapper, you're surely well-aware of the amount of artistic talent in osu!. That artistic talent extends beyond the range of only level creation though, and that's what this quest is about!

Find a song from [any Featured Artist who also has an osu! account](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists), along with a background created by someone who has an osu! account (check out some [osu! fanart contests](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests) if you need help with this), and combine that with your mapping expertise to create your own made-exclusively-by-osu!-players beatmap!

### [Monthly Beatmapping Contest returns v4](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be36dc83d944d73db42ef) ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)

Rank a map from any of your [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) submissions.

If you've never made a map for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest, the next iteration will likely happen before this quest's deadline!

### [Building bridges](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be404c83d944d73db432c) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

The Mappers' Guild began as a way for mappers to collaborate, and we're still sticking to that all these years later. This time however, it's with people across mode boundaries.

Work with up to **TWO other mappers** to create a multi-mode beatmap set covering 3 different game modes. In this case, osu!mania's key modes don't count as separate modes. The point here is to branch out, not just talk to your neighbours.

Each of the three mappers (or only yourself, if you're a multi-mode mapping savant) will earn priority quest prizes.

### [Classified: Artist edition v3](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be4bfc83d944d73db4335) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

This quest goes back to the roots of the Mappers' Guild: **making maps for upcoming Featured Artists**.

Your goal is to create and rank a map for it to be showcased in the artist's upcoming announcement! To participate in this quest, the first step is to select an artist from the [quest page](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be4bfc83d944d73db4335).

Unlike previous Classified quests, this one gives you a decent selection upfront, and allows re-rolling your selection. You're given all available songs for an upcoming artist, and your goal is to create and rank a map for any of them. If all goes well, your map will be showcased in the artist's announcement!

Unlike previous iterations, this quest is open to any Mappers' Guild members, not only those tier 1 and above!

### [The Hurdle v6](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be45fc83d944d73db4330) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

If you're a new mapper, you don't need extra restrictions on your creativity. Making a map is tough enough on its own.

This quest is simple: **create and rank your first beatmap!**

## Conclusion

[The priority quest list](https://mappersguild.com/missions) awaits. Pick out a song to map (or receive one from the [Classified quest](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=690be4bfc83d944d73db4335)), then start mapping already.

The `#mappers-guild` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) is the #1 place to ask about anything related to the Mappers' Guild or your Mappers' Guild maps, so feel free to take advantage of it!

In case you were wondering, a total of **394** maps have been Ranked for Mappers' Guild priority quests since their inception a couple years ago. That's a lot of maps. And a lot of keychains crafted in my garage.

Have fun mapping!
