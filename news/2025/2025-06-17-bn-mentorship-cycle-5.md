The BN Mentorship Program is back for another cycle of action!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/bn-mentorship/banner.jpg)

For those who haven't seen this before, the BN Mentorship Program is a [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team)–led effort to try and give modders interested in joining the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) the skills they may be lacking to do so.

For this cycle, we're accomodating drum bashers, fruit catches, and keyboard smashers only, since we feel **the osu! BN roster's pretty full right now**. Because of that, we're **putting the mentorship for the osu! game mode on hold for the time being** while we sort things out. Don't fret — we'll bring osu! mentors back as soon as we can!

Mentorship cycles last around 2 months, with this cycle being planned to run from **June 29th** to **August 31st**.

## Mentors

Below you'll find a list of mentors for the available game modes, alongside their time zones:
