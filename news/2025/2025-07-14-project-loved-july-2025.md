Project Loved hosts community voting polls every month to decide on beatmaps to be added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps chosen are lovingly selected by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes from community suggestions. Each beatmap banner in this news post will direct you to the respective poll. Alternatively, you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote soon! More information can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

[t+pazolite with siromaru - Chambarising](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/241792#osu) by [Bloodmoon_old_1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2429548)\
160 BPM, 4:49 | 7.62‚òÖ\
*description written by [Lilian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8589120)*

For this month's first *Popular Playcount*, we are bringing back an absolute classic in [t+pazolite with siromaru - Chambarising](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/241792#osu/558314).

If you joined the game around the time I did, you should recognise this map instantly. Anyone looking to work on their stamina and flow aim skills back in the day almost certainly loaded up this map, felt like a total beast for SSing the (OD6) streams, and then got completely destroyed by the second half and its brutal flow aim and stamina. Nowadays, this map's awkward streams betray its age, but if you're like me, you'll still find it just as fun as I did all those years ago.

If you want to see this map in the Loved section, be sure to vote Yes in this month's voting!

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The second Popular Playcount for this month is [aru-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7379108)'s map of [Adust Rain - Eleven Stud.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/909855#osu/1898692)

You have probably seen this map picked in multiplayer lobbies many times over the past 5 or so years, or you might have seen it in this [WhiteCat upload](https://youtu.be/QWpTSjNz6Go). Either way, regardless of how you found out about this map, the 100,000+ plays and 280+ favorites it garnered shows that it's *Loved* by many.

If you like NM1-type aim maps with some bursts in the mix, this is the perfect map for you. 200 BPM, 7.51‚òÖ of pure consistent difficult aim and a length of 3:44. You will be putting your overall consistency to the absolute test on this map. Be sure to look out for the 1/3 section before the break!

*description written by [Plasma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077431)*

For this month's *Outstanding Oldies* pick, we're going quite far back to 2009 with [RevenG - bag.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/11250#osu)

bag is quite possibly one of the first true tests of reading ability the game had to offer, with its astonishingly low AR of 2 despite its 4.66‚òÖ rating.

[Wojjan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32856)'s innovations, back in a time when grid mapping was still thriving, shine through in this map as you jump into a large selection of note-only linear patterns resembling various geometrical shapes and structures. It may take you a few tries to understand what's truly happening, but the satisfaction that comes from learning and hitting a difficult pattern for the first time is absolutely worth the time investment.

Why don't you try this classic out for yourself? Be sure to vote Yes on the poll if you enjoyed it!

Well, this is definitely a Spectacle. Here's M1LLI0N PP, a collab by.... too many mappers to list in this description. But you better believe it's good stuff! It also includes a nice storyboard by [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762), separating each section by mapper and song style.

On a song originally immortalised by the [2021 collab](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1277657#osu/2654506), this beatmap showcases OliBomby's own Sliderator tool, where the speed of a slider can be adjusted during its course. While this tool has been deemed unrankable, it still has a place in the Loved section! So expect to be caught off guard by some of these sliders, as their speed might not be what it seems.

Regardless of the Sliderator usage, this is just a very competent showcase of what would usually be called "hard tech" mapping, with insanely fast sliders, complex aim control patterns, 234 BPM streams, and a lot of surprises along the way.

Do you want to see more gems like this in Loved? Then make sure to vote Yes on this!

LISTEN! üó£Ô∏è

[Mazzerin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2942381) is once again entering Project Loved, this time with one of his more Daring Difficulties: [Dustvoxx - Disconnect Me (from saturator)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1373600#osu/2839767).

Coming in at 8.42‚òÖ, this map is home to some very challenging patterns, featuring 210 BPM cut streams and wiggles throughout, as well as sliders of all shapes and sizes, taking use of the Sliderator tool as well as incredible expertise from Mazzerin to create some of the most engaging tech gameplay out there. The song doesn't let down either. There are numerous changes in BPM as well as a couple speedup sections that can catch you very easily off guard.

If you want to see this masterpiece in the Loved category, let it be known by voting Yes this month!

This month's Ranked Reject is about as high octane as you can get. We bring you [sky_delta vs. Tanchiky - Fuse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1660405#osu) mapped by [Arushii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15664628).

Arushii is back with another graveyarded mapset, with this one created all the way back in 2021. That's old enough to make it his very first tech-focused mapset, which is mind blowing when you take a look at his current repertoire. Of course, its age doesn't stop this map from being a blast to play, bringing back the feel of mappers like [Akali](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2127359) with its flow-heavy technical style. Complete with guest difficulties by [Regussy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23487351) and [Zenoc](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16121913), this mapset may be on the smaller side, but when you've played through the map four times and are coming back for your fifth, it sure won't feel that way.

Make sure to vote Yes to see this set in Loved this month!!

For this month on *Gameplay Gimmicks*, we're entering the Bunny House.

Although only sitting at 6.44‚òÖ, [Bunny House](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1525458#osu/3121055) explores difficult doubletap gimmicks while also incorporating the thrilling and unique "chonk" style, influenced by the series of popular beatmaps by mapper [yaspo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4945926), including [chonk](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1262413#osu/2623955) and [chonk II](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1451075#osu/2983325). Don't believe me? [Megafan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6632605) says it himself: "**c h o n k**"

With a style derived from such challenging maps, it's no surprise that this map has received a bunch of tournament play, with the map even originating as a custom for [Clover Cup 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1325337?n=1)!

Make sure to hop towards that YES button this month if you'd like to see this map in Loved! üêá

Um... hello? Is this thing on?\
This week's *Second Shots* might look just a bit familiar.....

Goodbye Moonmen makes its return years after its original debut, now in an era where raw aim has progressed in both ranking criteria and player ceiling. There isn't much that needs to be said ‚Äî back in 2021, during the peak of COVID, it was a blessing just to watch [WhiteCat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxnD5YrMIgI) and [Vaxei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYk2VTurKQ) take turns retrying this map, chasing that beautiful near-10‚òÖ FC. Now, with hundreds of new aim warriors in 2025 ready to devour any aim challenge thrown their way, it's time to bring this one back for voting and let it finally reclaim its throne.

We say goodbye...... to the graveyard section üëçüëç Vote yes!

[Kanye West - The New Workout Plan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1612554#osu) by [Tatan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5646529) is this month's first *Wildcard* pick!

Clocking in at just over 5 minutes, this map utilises the narrative that the song progresses with, to create one of the most enjoyable alt maps out there. Tatan is no stranger to creating this kind of player-focused gameplay, however the ideas at display are more outlandish than usual, which is what places this map in a whole other league‚Äîthe execution is perfect.

There's no other better way to truly summarise why something like this is so great other than to, well... play it, which is what I encourage you to do. If it lived up to your expectations, voting "Yes" for this pick should be your next step!

[Planktonweed](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/959470#osu/2008748).

SPONGEBOZZ finally makes his long-overdue appearance in Project Loved as this week's second *Wildcard* pick. "Sponge bob smoke Weed" are the four divine words the creator has left us, as we channel our inner top player and grind out retries on this legendary 30-second pure fast aim check. It's a perfect multiplayer banger, a hilarious tournament wildcard, and an incredible way to show your friends what osu! is really about. There's just so much to love about Planktonweed‚Äîand it's time we finally pay tribute to the king of all aim maps.

Vote yes... for SPONGEBOZZ.

Everything about this map is raw. The instrumentals with that guitar, the vocal cover, the clean structuring, the slider shapes, the stream section... it's all just so... *emotional*. This is a map you really gotta play to understand why it's so good, but be warned ‚Äî once you do you will NEVER stop putting this on in multi lobbies with your friends. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Typ4 did a great job with this map and it's a shame it hasn't received the love it deserves until now. Vote Yes this month to give it just that!

*description written by [nevqr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14269506)*

Let's start off the month with an absolute [Slax](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/465) classic ‚Äî [Baka Paka](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1961281#taiko/4064701).

[Lefty3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4719175) is no stranger to making popular maps, and Baka Paka isn't an exception. Ranging from 225 to 315 BPM, there's a difficulty for everyone! It doesn't matter whether you're a stream beginner or a stream decimator, just pick the difficulty tailored to your skill level! Is 225 BPM too hard? Simply turn on HT. Is 315 BPM too easy? Uhhh... it shouldn't be, but there's always DT!

Even though the so-called stream meta has ended, comfortable and fun stream maps are still some of the most sought-after maps to this day! In fact, it's almost been three years since we've seen a proper Slax-style stream map in the Loved section!

I personally think this is one of the most well-crafted stream maps ever, and I guarantee you'll enjoy playing it, but hey, who am I to convince you about that? Boot up osu!, play the map, and don't forget to vote!

Let me start off with a quote by [Felt7z](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8089834) himself.

> \
>   "Time spent with cats is never wasted."

Felt also had another thing to say, but you're gonna need to check out [the map description](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/813509#taiko) for that :D

Now that we got that out of the way, this map is an absolute trip. It feels like you're on an excursion going through a Japanese zoo while listening to a bunch of meowing, barking and anime vocals. Just wonderful, am I right? The funniest thing is that this song actually comes from Taiko no Tatsujin, though honestly, who would've thought otherwise?

Felt7z is famous for his [DJ Fennec series](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?m=1&q=creator%3Dfelt7z%20dj%20fennec&s=graveyard) (quite a fitting name to this song), which combines innovative dump and double BPM mapping, and this map is no different! Beware of monos with different snaps though, they're quite tough here! If this kind of mapping isn't your thing, give the Chronicle difficulty a try! It's mapped like an average Inner Oni with no 1/6 or 1/8 patterns.

I hope you have fun with this one, and be sure to vote for the aforementioned kitty map ‚Çç^. .^‚Çé‚üÜ

This is a very cool map made by [-xNaCLx-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1530993)!\
This map is composed mainly of patterns containing SVs and 1/6's.\
However, this is not at all unpleasant, and the composition of the song and map makes it a pleasant map to play.\
We want you to see for yourself!

Fun fact: the artist of this song, Sound Horizon, also goes by Linked Horizon, whose songs can be heard in Attack on Titan.

[Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091) has made many challenge maps in the past, and [Seiryu - AO-INFINITY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1847343#taiko/3794832) is certainly one of them, with very difficult tech patterns featuring 1/6+1/8 snappings despite its fast BPM!\
The first kiai, in particular, is mainly comprised of 1/6 quadruplets, which is also challenging, but the difficulty level increases significantly in the last kiai.\
Not only is it dense but also rhythmically arranged, so you will have a hard time hitting all the notes... (Even as a top player I find it difficult!!)

Featured in [AGTS 2022](https://gtsosu.com/2022/agts/home) and [TSC 2023](https://gtsosu.com/2023/tsc/home), [tachyon - faster than light](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1748152#taiko/3575755) has been one of the most beloved hyperflip maps throughout the history of osu!taiko. [ler1211](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19901680) is back in Loved votings as his maps never cease to amaze players. This map has many SV changes and challenging offhand patterns, not to mention the staple 1/6 snappings used for many hyperflip songs. This is certainly a map that will satiate all the mod lovers out there. To add more sauce to the dish, [My Angel Koishi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8273098), a.k.a Sar7, takes a different approach to the song, focusing on more extreme highs and lows of slider velocity. Be sure to check both of the difficulties out if you want double the fun!

Please cast your Yes vote if you're a fan of this map, and hope you have a fun time fighting the leaderboard!

Those familiar with [Jerry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605973) would be aware of his other gameplay gimmick-oriented storyboard maps, such as [beatMARIO - Night of Knights](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1105509). Similarly, [Gawr Gura - REFLECT (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1499795#taiko) contains two main gimmicks affecting gameplay - one where the colors of notes are filled in as the map is played, and one where the notes invert colors.

Storyboard maps are somewhat of a rarity in osu!taiko, so be sure to vote yes if you enjoy these sorts of shenanigans!!

Travelling back to 2017, [Gekidan Hitotose - Curtain Call!!!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/597095#taiko/1262396) mapped by [Y O U T A](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4909860) is up for Loved voting! Curtain Call!!!!! is for all players who enjoy high BPM, with most of the map being 298 BPM and including a full spread from Kantan to the 7.67‚òÖ top difficulty Hinako! Each difficulty is great at testing each respective skill range on high BPM, all the way up to the hardest difficulty. The Hinako difficulty is a very fun and comfortable burst map featuring mostly 3, 5, & 7 note 1/4 patterns as well as some longer and more challenging patterns to finish off the map!

If you want to practice your speed, regardless of your level, give Curtain Call!!!!! a try!!!!!

The \[THALASSOPHOBIA\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [CTBWhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620002)*

Welcome to the depths. 18 minutes, 16,929 combo map. I'll repeat that. 1.. 6.. 9.. 2.. 9.. COMBO spanning over 18 MINUTES.\
This map was so big, Sutavv had to actually split it into 2 parts in order to meet the ScoreV1 maximum score limitation.

[Sutavv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5320583) is back and with one of his biggest projects to date. Perhaps one of the most jam-packed maps ever created in CTB.\
This map is perhaps the final boss of CTB in terms of the hyperwalk technique. If you remember maps like [Der Wald](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/406881#fruits/884085), [AiAe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/550105#fruits), [Crisis City](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1205520#fruits), [Soulless 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/772138#fruits), or [Obsidian](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1130748#fruits/2361985), this map outdoes all of them. Why?

#1: Length - The length alone makes this map a gauntlet. 18 minutes with zero breaks within the map.

#2 Patterns - The patterns Sutavv uses in this map make this map guaranteed not sight readable. There are a huge amount of hyperwalk patterns that need careful practice, and to figure out the exact techniques for what makes them consistent. Not just that, but reading the patterns on top of doing the correct inputs is another challenge.

#3 Speed - There is a lot of speed required for specific sections, especially the climax ending, where you have to control 215 BPM wiggles, add that on top of stamina, and you have a beast.

Good luck!

[ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) is a very familiar sight in the Loved section, with some of his Loved maps dating as far back as the origins of the section, with many classics throughout the years. Whether it is game-breaking mechanics, unique ideas, or gimmicks, there is always something cool to see in an ExGon map.

[Cosmic Blaster](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2198796#fruits/4653112) is a custom map from [CWC 2024's Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024#finals), slotted in as the NM2. If you expected his style to have been watered down for tournament purposes, you'd be wrong‚Äîthis map is full of wild patterns, unpredictable snaps, awkward stacks and jumps with the usual ExGon flair added to them. Having remained a favourite among the community since its release, it is now being nominated for the Loved section. Vote for it or otherwise...

[Phukiir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4556538), formerly known as Sillyp, has been a pioneer and a veteran among the SV community, spearheading devices such as BPM-line gimmicks or pushing infinite BPM tricks to their limits back in the day. Speaking of "back in the day", this month's entry: [Drunken Stein](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1164662#mania/2429361), will bring back some fond memories from tournaments past. Or perhaps not so fond memories for some players.

*Drunken Stein* is a landmark of 2020 SV mapping. It is not immediately intuitive, yet flows very much in the way the music does. Which is to say that the musicality itself is something to be learned bit by bit. Many tournaments players who experienced the SV category may tell you their own experience learning this map: for those who haven't learned it yet, I would say it's a step by step process which requires due patience and diligence.

*Drunken Stein* is anything but predictable, despite the "easy memorization" label in its description. However, once you get the hang of it, I personally think the execution isn't that bad in terms of difficulty. It is still a fairly high difficulty SV in its own right though.

Have you learned this in the past? Are you eager to dive in the past as a newer player? Go ahead and dunk your vote in!

Though, needless to say, this chart is a complete step up in terms of difficulty from [Karma](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1158618#mania/2889383), not only because it is just faster but also because it is just so much longer than Karma. In addition, the jumpstreams which are present in the entire chart are extremely dense and will be sure to make you tired from playing even for a minute. Though speaking of length, this chart is nearly 6 minutes long and hardly has a break to make up any stamina that you will be losing.

If you are a fan of playing stamina gauntlets, which are sure to make your hands bleed, or if you are just a fan of the map Sherie is able to make, then be sure to press that vote on this map!

139 BPM, 1:19 | 5.25‚òÖ, 5.57‚òÖ\
*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Xonica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3586776)'s [Whoa Zone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1588473#mania/3244289) is notorious for being featured in the Reform Beta Dan, being a chordjack pick in one of the versions.

The "whoa dude" difficulty is a very challenging chart, considering the amount of anchors, hands, jumps, and even some quads at the very end. These would drain your stamina especially if you are not careful, as with jack picks, some may be accustomed to pressing the keys hard, especially if you are trying to accurately hit the patterns more. However, with this difficulty, you are really forced to try and conserve your energy, while still being able to play the chart at a consistent pace. It is definitely going to be a tough challenge, but overcoming this can help train so much of your fundamentals in chordjack transitions, and especially stamina.

Thankfully, if you would want a difficulty with shorter and lesser anchors, the Whoa difficulty is for you. In comparison to "whoa dude", the chart is definitely more forgiving, and could give more players a shot at training their chordjack skills, since you don't have to worry as much in the stamina factor, and you may be able to focus more on trying to understand how to properly read chordjack patterns. That being said, it's still definitely going to be a chore to accurately hit these patterns.

At 139 BPM, Whoa Zone will definitely present itself as a chordjack chart that can be a great foundation for players to be able to transition into harder charts. Bridging the gap between stamina, accuracy, and reading certainly makes this a tough challenge, and I can see why this chart was chosen to be selected in one of the Reform Dan versions.

I feel like its popularity and chart structure already fit the criteria for Project Loved, and it's definitely a long time coming. If you agree with that, then don't be afraid to vote 'Yes', as I can't wait to be surprised by the scores that will be set on this chart.

*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[ilikexd](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2450614) has made many kinds of charts, such as streams, tech, jumpstreams, and many more. [Goblin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1543786#mania/3155501) fits all three skillsets that were mentioned, as each of those skills are represented by parts of the chart.

One of the factors that makes this chart really difficult is the patterning. As mentioned, there are different skillsets that are being tested in this chart, and you really have to pay attention to every single one in order to be able to properly hit those. It doesn't help that there are also a lot of broken jumpstreams that can really make your wrists very unstable if you are not careful.

By the way, did I forget to mention the trill that changes in BPM? That one requires a lot of accuracy and precision. Getting a good accuracy will take an exceptional amount of skill in order to be able to time it.

Because of its awkwardness, performing well in this chart on command is certainly no easy task, which is why this was selected in tournaments, such as [MWC 4K 2021 Semifinals (1.2x)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1543786#mania/3155497), and also [SOFT6 Finals (1.35x)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1543786#mania/3155498).

If you think 1.0x is already doable for you, don't be afraid to try the higher rates, as luckily for you, there exists up to 1.4x the speed of the original chart. Through much practice and improvement of fundamentals, this chart can be doable; however, I would say that accuracy should also be something you should look out for, as this being in OD 8.5 can be very punishing for so much of this chart.

With so many skillsets on the rice department being tested out, there should be no question that this is very good training for fundamentals, especially for a tournament setting. If you think this chart deserves to be Loved as well, then don't hesitate to give out a 'Yes' vote, and add more to the collection of [ilikexd](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2450614) charts in Loved!

Well, well, well, if it isn't another [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881) nomination...

The user with one of, if not the most, Loved maps in the game, we're seeing yet another fated nomination this month, that being [Kemono Mimi Loli no Wakusei](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1086070#mania/3504642).

While this is more considerably a popularity pick rather than a jumpstream pick, it still mostly consists of jumpstream as the main difficulty behind the chart. That's not to say it doesn't differentiate itself from said pattern, as there are the occasional long notes that have pretty important emphasis on the sounds they're charted to, despite the low amount of them.

Starting at 240 BPM, it's overall a very solid chart for getting a grip on faster jumpstream patterns. But, as always, there are uprates for those who simply don't feel that it's hard enough. The immense popularity is definitely justified, so if you're one of those people who already know and enjoy it, then go in the thread and vote!

The [Plain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1101700#mania/2301548) difficulty focuses heavily on how accurate you are at playing jumpstreams, with a mix of handstreams and split-trill patterns that can really throw you off if you are not paying attention. There are also a few LNs mixed into this chart, even some during the heavy jumpstream section. Now imagine playing that, but with much more LN integration, and that's our segue into the [Plain LN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1101700#mania/2303455) difficulty.

See, this isn't just a matter of the entire chart being converted into LN, but it also incorporates multiple challenges that you can see in other LN skillsets. The start of the chart contains some LN coordination / LN release aspects, while giving you a hint of LN density later on. However, what makes this part really challenging is that there are so many parts that could easily make you unstable. Remember those split-trill and handstream patterns that exist in the [Plain](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1101700#mania/2301548) difficulty? That basically is the same in this one, only there are many more nuances, such as LN readability and LN accuracy, forcing you to be very sharp with how well you release your Long Notes.

If you think that wasn't hard enough, there's a 1.2x difficulty as well, which has been used in tournaments such as the [osu!mania Long Note Tournament 2 Grand Finals](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/2#finals-week-2), and also [MWC 4K 2022 Finals (although an edited difficulty)](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K#finals).

[pieerre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9201507)'s charts are so fun to play, and I think here they've created a very difficult and interesting chart. If you think so as well, then don't be afraid to cast your vote for this chart, placing them in the Loved section for the first time!

You are likely very familiar with the renowned Strong 280. You may find it quite challenging, as the high-speed endurance stream can be dizzying... The good news is that this time we will nominate its original track! Moreover, almost all of the quarter beats have been removed. Even the BPM of the original track will be slightly lower. So basically the map is arranged with mid-density in 132 (140 in speed up difficulty) BPM. And the [speed up cut version](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2134122) was featured in [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_7K) Finals RC4. Give it a try!

The \[Delete \[GLHF's 25\]\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Carpihat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10085090)*

It has been some time since we last nominated a 6K pack. I guess many 6K players may have been eagerly awaiting this! Therefore, this time we will be nominating a large 6K pack that integrates two packs (referred to as [A](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1621543) and [B](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1769031)). The difficulty ranges from Level 12 to Level 21. So, as long as you are a player with a certain level of skill in 6K, you will find enjoyable difficulties for yourself. If you enjoy 6K, please vote for the pack!
