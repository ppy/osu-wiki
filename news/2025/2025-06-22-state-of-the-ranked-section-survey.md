Pollers wanted — help us pave the way forward for the future of the Ranked section!

As we soon approach a new turning point in the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure) section, we would like to take a moment to ask the community for their feelings on the section's current state. Admittedly, this is not a task we can tackle alone. Therefore, we would like to touch some base with the community to evaluate what would be the best way to step forward.

The mapping landscape is constantly evolving, and knowing what most of the community wants at any given time is difficult. Answering these questions will take no more than 5 minutes and will be very helpful to us!

While everyone is encouraged to participate in the above poll, [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) will be getting their own private poll. While the questions will not be any different, this will help us compare and contrast two sides of one same coin.

The polls will be open for **x weeks**, and the results will be posted in a separate news post, alongside some initial impressions from the team.
