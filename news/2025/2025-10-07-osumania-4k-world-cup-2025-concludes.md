The apex of osu!mania 4K tournaments draws to a close. Join us in this nail-biting finale, as one of the most exciting iterations of the series we've witnessed comes to an end!

What a rollercoaster of emotions this year was. While the latter half of the tournament has arguably been the strongest and most exciting to watch, we were likewise not short of surprises and highlights throughout the earlier rounds. From upsetting seeding results to new teams making their debut and extremely narrow score gaps, we've seen it all!

But let us get straight to the point, for there are winners (and staff members!) to congratulate. For the last time this year, we want to extend our thanks to [Dynascape](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8784587), [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), and [akace100](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9308128) for making the video recaps a reality. For those who are in dire need of a video while eating, may we suggest the following:

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_4K/img/mwc4k2025-podium.jpg?2)

**Congratulations to the ::{ flag=US }:: United States for winning the osu!mania 4K World Cup 2025!** A feat that hardly anyone can attain once, let alone 4 times.

While many will claim this was an effortless victory, we want to make it clear it was anything but. Both ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea and ::{ flag=CN }:: China gave the ::{ flag=US }:: United States a run for their money given their strong performances. This did not deter the North Americans, for they managed to pull through and secure one of their most well-earned victories to date.

Congratulations to ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea and ::{ flag=CN }:: China as well for their performances. Knowing that victory was within their reach, we hope they can bounce back even stronger next year!

![Grand Finals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-concludes/mappool-gf.jpg)

Starting off our recap with [Camellia - POLYBIUS GB SPEEDRUN (Glitchless 100% WR in 0:03:57)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438737#mania/5318882) (HB2) by ::{ flag=CN }:: [gzdongsheng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8660315), ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), ::{ flag=CN }:: [Yuiesta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13953619), and ::{ flag=IT }:: [rikan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25263357) — a collaboration between four mappers! Surely enough, this is the closest MWC 4K has really ever gotten to a "mini-TB" pick in the main pool, with the song coming to almost 4 whole minutes of drain time. As with previous maps in the HB2 slot, this one is not much different with its constant use of high-BPM shields, alongside eccentric bursts and gluts.

About a third of the way through the map, you are sure to notice a heavy dumpy polyrhythmic section, not to mention a rough technical longjack-focused section just before the halfway mark, which also makes a reprise near the end (where you may least expect it!). To cap it all off, the map ends with a barrage of pure technical rice patterns, befitting of the speedcore that the song switches to at that point.

We also saw LN Coordination finally reach its peak with [yuikonnu x sana - Fuzzy Future](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438740#mania/5318888) (LN1) by ::{ flag=CN }:: [Hylotl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18270260). Right off the bat, it's worth mentioning that this behemoth of an LN map has a drain time of **4 whole minutes** on the dot, meaning consistency at high intensity is undoubtedly a massive requirement to play this chart. As expected of the consistency slot, you're thrown very jack-heavy LN patterns, alongside many 1/4 flams and bursts. Considering that this is 290 BPM, the fact that there are also quite a few 1/6 notes in the mix can make this even more of an accuracy test than it already is.

Similar to the Semifinals map pool, the Grand Finals pool also has an abundance of [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music)! What better place to start than the very first slot of the pool? [LUZE - !!! IMPULSIVE <!!> WAVE !!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438724#mania/5318853) (RC1) by ::{ flag=US }:: [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082) made its way in with single streams clocking in at an absurd 390 BPM. If you're at all familiar with MWC 4K pools from previous years, you might've thought it has similar structure to [a different song](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1796541#mania/3682631), made by [the same artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/500), and charted by the same person, to which we'd tell you that was very much the idea behind it.

As expected of extratone, the patterns very much represent the amount of chaos going on, with the "easier" sections still giving you more technical patterns in order to always have you on edge for the entire duration of the song. With a spectacular illustration from ::{ flag=AU }:: [-pineapple-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326) and graphic design work by ::{ flag=US }:: [mohca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14499702) and ::{ flag=MY }:: [Iyouka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499), there's a fully fledged original experience just itching to be played! But it's not for the faint of heart...

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-concludes/orphic.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438747#mania/5318904)

</div>

Our second osu! original for this week was [roer - orphic](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438747#mania/5318904) (HB1) by ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576). As usual for the HB1 slot, this map contains extremely difficult high-BPM patterns, but this map stands alone in the HB1 category with how absolutely technical it is. At a whopping 300 BPM, this is likely the highest BPM a Hybrid in MWC 4K has ever truly achieved. The mapping bears striking resemblance to a [previous osu! original from MWC 4K](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062241#mania/4311938), and it is also a direct sequel to a [previous song by the same artist](https://soundcloud.com/roerdtm/intuit) which was also featured in an osu! mania tournament. It even comes with a slick background *and* video made by ::{ flag=NZ }:: [krabtown](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3388033) and ::{ flag=MY }:: [mochasan_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23804364) — what more could you want?

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-concludes/Once_Forgotten_Nothing_Remains.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438757#mania/5318924)

At last, the tiebreaker. You've probably seen it by now. A near ten-minute full-on onslaught of a tiebreaker map, [Raphiiel - Once Forgotten, Nothing Remains](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438757#mania/5318924). Not only is it a whopping 8-mapper collaboration, but also a cinematic experience brought to life with splendid work from our amazing design team.

The collaborator list for this map alone is so large, we'll need a table:

| Area | Contributors |
| :-- | :-- |
| Music | [Raphiiel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/502) |
| Mapping | ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438747#mania/5318904), ::{ flag=CA }:: [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), ::{ flag=US }:: [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093), ::{ flag=US }:: [0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707), ::{ flag=US }:: [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811), ::{ flag=IT }:: [rikan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25263357), ::{ flag=TH }:: [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723), ::{ flag=TW }:: [[Crz]FolAH1217](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6232458) |

[Raphiiel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/502) may be recognisable from another song of theirs, *RoquiRa : Between Life and Death* (from their [*HARDCORE UTOPIA 3* album](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/205)), a song that was mapped for the [Finals tiebreaker of last year's MWC 4K](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2250157#mania/4785276). This one is similar in both length and vibes, with a fully fleshed-out story about a girl reaching out for her last hope in a desolate world.

We invite you to come check out this map for yourself, or even just watch the showcase video as it is a complete experience in and of itself!

## Grand Finals recap

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| China ::{ flag=CN }:: | 2 | **7** | ::{ flag=KR }:: **South Korea** |
| **United States** ::{ flag=US }:: | **7** | 3 | ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea |

Only two matches this week, but as per usual, quality trumps quantity. For as few matches we have in the last rounds of the tournament, they're always packed with exciting moments. This year was no exception, of course. While we didn't get to see an encore between China and the United States, South Korea's performance throughout the weekend more than made up for it — especially their bout against the United States!

We've also got a round of special [interviews](#interviews) for those who'd like to learn about the tournament's know-hows.

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea

</div>

Now at the very tail end of the tournament, only two teams remain: the ::{ flag=US }:: United States and ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea. Despite being sent to the losers' bracket as early as Quarterfinals, South Korea made an amazing comeback, beating 5 teams along the way, including the #1 seeded China en route to the Grand Finals stage. Meanwhile, the United States came off from an extremely close match against China, being taken to tiebreaker and losing only by 1,208 points. With how hectic both brackets have been, there's no doubt that crazy things were about to unfold.

The amount of strategy that went into the protect and ban phase alone should not be underestimated. With both rivals knowing their opponents' strengths and weaknesses, both teams opted to play their cards as best as they could. With only two long note picks open, South Korea had to bank hard on the long note and hybrid picks as their rivals were proven to be much stronger on rice picks.

Right after the ban phase, the United States showed why going into rice territory against them was not ideal, as they immediately stole a break point off [Hoshimachi Suisei - soiree](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438530#mania/5318306) (RC6), and then won their own point through [Himeringo - Yotsuya-san ni Yoroshiku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438682#mania/5318764) (RC2). While the Koreans gave it their all, the duo of ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) and ::{ flag=US }:: [\_dev\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16407268) was proving to be too formidable. With help from players like ::{ flag=US }:: [Minwoo3098](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18356454), this was all the support that the United States wingman would need.

The South Koreans weren't easily deterred by their rivals' strong start. They took some ground back after ::{ flag=KR }:: [ggeexx1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17494164), ::{ flag=KR }:: [Naaaad](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10344857), and ::{ flag=KR }:: [imyeeyee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26473894)'s consistency dominated [Kou! - TERABYTE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438746#mania/5318901) (HB4). From thereon, both teams began trading blows left and right, ending in a 4–2 scoreline in favour of the United States.

Things started to look a bit dire for the South Koreans as the Americans would steal yet another break point off [Earth, Wind & Fire - September (yomoha remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438648#mania/5318620) (LN4) all thanks to ::{ flag=US }:: [Hello_Son](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17308009)'s performance. What could've easily ended on a 6–2 by their pick on [yuikonnu x sana - Fuzzy Future](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438740#mania/5318888) (LN1) was very fortunately avoided thanks to South Korea's performance (particularly that of ::{ flag=KR }:: [imyeeyee](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26473894)), and admittedly a miracle after the United States missed during the last moments of the map. While things were looking bleak, the South Koreans kept fighting back despite all the pressure they had to endure!

Unfortunately for the South Koreans, that was going to be the last point they would get. By missing their chance to regain some ground by losing their protect [Camellia - POLYBIUS GB SPEEDRUN (Glitchless 100% WR in 0:03:57)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438737#mania/5318882) (HB2) after the United States' stellar performance, the deal was sealed once the U.S. team was able to pick [Tomato cat - Pretzels](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438707#mania/5318811) (RC5). Ultimately, the chart's technical difficulty was too much for the South Koreans to overcome, while the United States had rice consistency down pat.

There were so many other ways this match could have gone, especially with how insanely well both teams have been performing throughout the tournament. Despite South Korea's loss, they proved that they could stand toe to toe against the United States. It is very exciting to see how far both teams have come, and seeing them fight on this final bout has left us wondering how the next chapter of the osu!mania 4K World Cup will unfold. We wish both teams the best for the future!

## Score highlights

Being one of the hardest maps in the whole round, [LUZE - !!! IMPULSIVE <!!> WAVE !!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438724#mania/5318853) (RC1) has been a thorn on many players' sides. Most players can't keep up with the crazy bursts, let alone holding their accuracy. There is but one exception: ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) managed to achieve a score of 995,014 dominating their match and flabbergasting everyone along the way!

While ::{ flag=KR }:: [ggeexx1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17494164) has proven to be very skillful in many patterns, none are as strong as his jack skills. In [Camellia feat. chiisana - re:||VERSE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438731#mania/5318865) (RC4), they managed to get a (Score V1) SS with only 60 Perfects. That's a 1:59 ratio with a score over 999k points — the only one of the entire round!

Last but not least, while [Earth, Wind & Fire - September (yomoha remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2438648#mania/5318620) (LN4) made many players choke on its many minijack shields, ::{ flag=US }:: [Hello_Son](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17308009) was able to tame the beast and achieve a 990,229 score on, arguably, one of the hardest long note picks of this round's mappool.

It's good to have you back on another Grand Finals tiebreaker song. You've contributed to more than a dozen World Cup projects over the past two years, but your involvement in the community goes back even further. Could you share a bit about your experience both as a player and a graphic designer?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Z419.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966">Zeth</a></p>

My experience as a player goes way back to 2017, when I found osu! through my high school's computer lab where someone had installed the game on one of the PCs. With Taiko no Tatsujin being my first ever exposure to rhythm games, I immediately gravitated towards osu!taiko ever since I found out the game had taiko mode, and everything else is history. 

Since then, I have been getting involved in basically all aspects of the game and the community, starting as a mapper and have since ranked a few dozen maps. I later moved on to contributing to tournaments, not as a designer yet, but mainly as a mapper and referee across many tournaments, with a focus on [Global Taiko Showdown](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS). I also managed OTMT ([osu!taiko Malaysian Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/OTMT)) and [Project Prism](/wiki/Tournaments/Project_Prism/2024) later on, and even dabbled in a few more "official" roles, including Beatmap Spotlights Curator and Qualified Inspector during its test run phase. My player experience has been very fruitful too, being one of the few Completionists for osu!taiko, as well as a top player for Malaysia for as long as I've been playing, and I also participated in several World Cups in the past.

If you cannot tell, I love this game a lot — even if there are times where I have grudges and complaints towards the community, it is so deeply rooted in me that it has become a huge part of my life since.

My experience as a graphic designer is much more recent, starting in 2021 when I stumbled across a class that taught the basics of Adobe Photoshop while I was attending university. I had dabbled with tools like Canva and similar tools in the past, but learning Adobe Photoshop in my studies back then gave me so much interest in the software that I decided to learn it myself after class hours.

That slowly snowballed into learning graphic design in general, and I decided that this is my thing, which led me to self-teach graphic design as well as other skills like 3D modeling and design using Blender in my free time over the past few years. osu! community tournaments, specifically Global Taiko Showdown, then presented me with lots of opportunities to work on my skills by designing tournament graphics, overlays, and eventually even original song designs for them, which led to my massive improvement over the years. Now I am both a full-time graphic designer in real life working for a marketing agency, as well as a freelancer working on cool projects such as World Cups, digital and physical album designs, and even an [MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pIFCW3RfvY) or two during my free time.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024">Sakura006</a></p>

The story behind *Once Forgotten, Nothing Remains* was detailed extensively by [Raphiiel](https://soundcloud.com/whos-raphiiel) in a long narrative document shared with the design team. As the song carried a heavy and evocative theme that needed to be reflected through its visuals, how did you draw inspiration from that story when creating the background, cover, and banner designs? Were there particular design decisions you felt were key to capturing the song's mood and narrative?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Z419.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966">Zeth</a></p>

When I design for album or song jackets, I usually start by listening to the song as much as possible to understand the story or message the composers are trying to convey. I then interpret that through graphics. For Once Forgotten, Nothing Remains, Raphiiel provided a detailed narration (included in beatmap description), which gave me a much clearer picture without needing to rely only on the song.

At the same time, it also set a specific direction for the design, leaving me with less freedom for personal interpretation compared to projects where I only work from the music itself. The team members who started working on the project before me, particularly the illustrators and VFX designers, also influenced my decisions later on, and my work was built on top of what they had illustrated and animated for the song.

For design choices, I rely heavily on colors, detailing, and typography to convey the right feeling. The narrative was set in a snowy, cold, and desolate ruin, and the story itself is particularly dark, so the designs needed to reflect that atmosphere even if the illustration didn't explicitly include those elements.

Raphiiel provided some initial inspiration and a moodboard for the song at the start of the project, which I used as a reference by incorporating some of its elements. Once I received the illustration from [Minerva Rin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30314534), I immediately began designing the overlaying elements such as UI elements, snowflakes, accent colors, text details, and also compositing the illustration with images of ice and snow, as well as flower petals hinting at the flower in the character's hair. Every detail matters, and even the smallest ones help pull everything together, whether or not viewers consciously notice them.

[Panthullu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298)'s title design was especially impactful. His fragmented yet elegant style captured the "tragic but beautiful" nature of the song and narrative perfectly. We had agreed on the work distribution beforehand, so I simply passed him my completed design and asked for the title with very little instruction. He did such a great job on it, and the design wouldn't be complete without his contribution.

As a graphic designer, your work often serves as the visual foundation for the entire project. What challenges did you face when working on this tiebreaker, and how did you collaborate with other roles — like illustrators, storyboarders, or VFX designers — when they needed additional graphic support or guidance?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Z419.jpg')"></a>

The biggest challenge was definitely time. I had to wait for the illustrator to finish the illustration before I could begin working, since GFX can only take place once the illustrations are done and there was no guarantee my initial ideas would fit if I started too early. It would have been a waste of time and effort to scrap everything if the design didn't match the final illustration. The schedule was so tight that the final design, including the title, was only completed few days before the showcase. It was definitely a close call — but I'm glad people really liked the result.

I like how collaboration within the team was less about direct back-and-forth and more about inspirations and shared ideas. The video could not exist without the song and narrative, the storyboard could not exist without the video, and so on down the chain. Even though we worked on our parts individually on different days, the recurring design motifs — such as snowflakes, accenting red colors, consistent fonts, and other design elements — reflected the shared ideas that tied everything together.

In a more direct sense, my main contribution outside of GFX was assisting with the video. I worked closely with [sugosugiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15118952), offering suggestions, advice, and providing design elements that she used to complete the final video reveal alongside [DAi_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/38467605). From there, it's important to also recognize how every part of the team contributed to bringing the project together. The illustrators — [Creameries](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15851364), [Minerva Rin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30314534), [enviyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12084808), and [Hiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15251809) — supported the team by preparing all the character and background illustration assets. [Panthullu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298) worked alongside me on graphic design, also contributing to quality assurance duties. Storyboarding was handled by [Kuroise](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127), [binarie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15632854), [Coppertine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7279762), and [Himada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10959366), who each brought their own unique touches to majority of the narrative.

This entire process was coordinated by [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024), with quality assurance provided by [RedcXca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601), [Panthullu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298), [LenLitchu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34098325), and [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) to ensure consistency across all assets. On the mapping side, [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093), [0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707), [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811), [rikan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25263357), [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723), and [\[Crz\]FolAH1217](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6232458) all came together to prepare the exciting beatmap. Finally, the replay was created by [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733), who was on standby and completed it live in a voice channel with our team members watching.

Having worked on every World Cup, you've seen the work process of our design team evolve firsthand. How has your approach to graphic design changed over time, and how do you view your role on the team now compared to when you first started?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Z419.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966">Zeth</a></p>

My approach to graphic design has largely stayed the same over the years — I make things because I want them to exist, because I love creating them, and because I want to share them with people. The same applies to designing for World Cups. I wanted more original songs to have beautiful, dedicated backgrounds, because I felt they deserved that level of visual identity. As my skills improved over the months and years, I've been able to provide stronger and more polished designs, and that's been my biggest motivation to keep going, even when the work is difficult or sometimes underappreciated by the community.

What has changed, however, is the scale of our production today compared to the past. In earlier years, we often had just one designer per role, or limited illustrations to work with. Now we have more people involved across every part of the pipeline — multiple illustrators, VFX designers, storyboarders, and GFX designers working together. This larger team has naturally made the process more complex, but it has also given us much more flexibility. With more assets, more perspectives, and more hands to help each other out, we all have the freedom to explore ideas in ways that weren't possible before.

As for my role, I feel it has remained consistent since I joined. I've always enjoyed working and collaborating with the team, drawing inspiration from the work we share with one another, and feeling like part of something integral to the tournament scene. That sense of collaboration has only grown stronger with the larger scale of production. I hope to keep that going while we continue to cook up better and better works for osu! originals.

When it comes to the osu!mania 4K World Cup, there are very few people as experienced as [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) is. Having held the title of mappooler and advisor for so many years as well as taking part into multiple different roles, there are very few things she hasn't done. As they relay their torch to the next generation of poolers, we want to get her first-hand experience as an integral part of the tournament for so long!

Congratulations on the conclusion of yet another (successful) osu!mania 4K World Cup! To start things off, we'd like for you to tell us a bit about yourself. After being part of the community for so many years, what made you lean towards being a map selector? What have been some of the hurdles you've faced along the way?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

My initial drive to pursue map selection was largely derived from the immense respect that I had for a lot of my favorite mappers at the time, a lot of whom were involved in map selection in MWC 4K 2017 and 2018, as well as the SOFT ([Springtime osu!mania Free-for-all Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT)) series. I greatly aspired to be among them in order to gain more insights about mapping, which was my primary passion at the time.

My first experience in map selection was actually a small nationals project that [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767) hosted a while back, which basically involved a handful of small brackets of like 8 players or so. Since it was a relatively low-stakes endeavor, and I was interested in map selection at the time, Raveille took me on for the job, and from there I was scouted to do CMT 2018 ([Chinese osu!mania 4K Tournament 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/CMT_4K/2018)), and then [SOFT 4](/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/4), and then [MWC 4K 2019](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2019_4K). Essentially, within less than a year, I had made three massive leaps that led me to my eventual position.

To be fully honest, I don't believe I got to my position on merit. I think if I had started involving myself with map selection maybe a few months later, I would never have made it to MWC in 2019. For years, I'd always say that I was just in the right place at the right time, and I was dragged into each of those roles mostly due to there being a lack of anyone else.

I was also really young, and I barely understood the size of the daunting tasks ahead of me. People were extremely critical of my pooling in MWC 4K 2019, since I was honestly barely holding together as is. But I managed in the end, with the guidance of my pooling mentors from SOFT 4, [lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052), [stupud man](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2141612), and [Guilhermeziat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3661387), as well as my fellow map selectors in MWC 4K 2019, namely [Feraligatr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7439226) (AKA Dergo), [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656), [WalterToro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5281416), and [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707). I learned a lot about how to handle feedback and pressure, as well as navigating issues such as a mapper refusing to change something that had to be changed.

That's not to say the early years went fully smoothly by any means; there were a lot of hiccups along the way, and a multitude of mistakes that I made. But I continued to strive to become better at map selecting, and eventually, I was in charge of essentially the entire mappool — everything outside of SVs — by the time [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K) rolled around. Particular members were extremely helpful starting around the 2021-2022 era, such as [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479), and [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723). Ever since, we have tried to find new and better ways to make mappooling easier for everyone. Even now, I feel like we are still continuing to optimize and improve our workflows, which in turn allows for greater mapper creativity.

Many users wonder what a map selector's role is beyond just choosing maps. Could you give us some insight on the many different tasks involved?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

There is so much more than meets the eye when it comes to map selection. In MWC 4K, we had been gradually increasing the amount of custom maps created specifically for the tournament, and we hit a custom rate of about 70% in 2023, which was a massive step up from the less than 50% in 2022. So now, map "selection" is not even the majority of the work! Being able to coordinate these custom maps in a way that not only fits the desired difficulty aims of our pools and reduces overlap, but also maintains the level of quality that people have come to expect from our custom maps, is an extreme endeavor, especially if we want to still be able to give mappers room for creativity and artistic intention.

On top of all of these pursuits, there are other things that make this even more difficult: for one, we also have to coordinate original songs, basically from start to finish. Before any map selection even starts, we must provide artists with enough information for what we require in the song they are to deliver, but not so much to the point where they feel confined and restricted in the process of making it. Thus, we also must have a semi-concrete vision of how the song is going to end up with regards to its placement within the mappool, as well as who would end up being assigned to map it.

Another reason is that with MWC's workflow change, more and more community tournaments have begun to take on a similar internal format. This is not a problem in itself, but as community efforts continue to raise the demand of high quality custom maps, and (I'd like to think) our mappers are some of the best available, a lot of our team ends up getting spread really thin across multiple tournaments. It's rather unfortunate, since I personally would love to help out with more tournaments across the yearly cycle, but once "MWC work season" really hits, I essentially can't do anything else — the same also goes for many of our map selectors, and some of our most active mappers and playtesters. This also puts more strain on everyone.

I don't believe this is something that will ever fully resolve, since I think it is good for more community efforts to be pursued! But I do believe workflow optimizing implementations remedy this issue as much as possible, and that is something that we have been focusing on for the past couple of years.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063">RandomeLoL</a></p>

We're all hoping to see what's in store for the community next year. Are there any plans set on stone already? Is there anything that, as a mappooler, you'd want to focus on in the coming years?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-mint-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576">-mint-</a></p>

Yes! We have lots of plans. We've already made massive adjustments to our internal structure, including adding new members to the map selector role, as well as appointing users to roles we collectively refer to as "Expeditors" — [Ucitysm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14768693) (Metadata Coordinator), [-NoName-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10400730) (Song Usage Coordinator), and [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063) (Ranking Coordinator). A lot of work that was previously in the hands of a few map selectors is being more evenly distributed in 2026, and I think that is a really good sign for the future of MWC 4K.

A major reason I was hesitant to step down from my lead selector position before now was a sentiment shared by the rest of the map selectors — there were too many items in the workflow that had to go through me. It is only until now that we all really felt fully confident that even without my presence, the current map selector roster would be able to carry the mappool process the whole way through. Thus, I have stepped down from fully leading the process, and I am now focusing on the following items: Hybrid and LN Quality Assurance, mapper assignments, and helping our new map selectors and expeditors.

On top of this, I plan to run an informal tournament mapping-specific mentorship program this year (similar to [RAFT](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1912977)) but without the tournament itself attached to it. I don't have anything to announce as of yet, but if this sounds like something that interests you, please be on the lookout.

With that last interview over, we can finally say goodbye to everyone who has been following along this year's recaps. More importantly, we want to extend everyone who has managed to make this World Cup possible!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-07-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-concludes/mwc4k2025-credits.png)

Last but not least, we want to thank the community for their endless support and encouragement to their favourite teams. Regardless of their final placement, what'll matter the most is always going to be the process — not the outcome. We can only hope the feeling is mutual, both between players, spectators, and staff members alike.

After all, we're all here to enjoy (presumably) our favourite game. If it's not fun, why bother?
