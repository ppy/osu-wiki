Ready or not, **unfeeling** is here.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/509/header.jpg)

Breakcore runs through **unfeeling**'s blood. Ukranian artist **unfeeling** has been producing music for 8 years (and [playing osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7100478) for even longer!), designing their own aural experiences with a focus on atmosphere-heavy, melancholic moving drum & bass elements. Pay no mind to the irony in someone with the name "**unfeeling**" creating highly emotional music.

We're good in supply today. **27** tracks now have permanent residence in [**unfeeling**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/509), pre-timed and ready for mapping whenever you are.

If you're looking for some inspiration, there's a big rectangle worth clicking below (along with a bunch of other song previews):
