At long last, we've reached the tournament's mid-way point! Join us for the Quarterfinals recap as we enter the latter, and arguably most competitive, half of the tournament.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-17-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-quarterfinals-recap/banner.jpg)

As teams get eliminated left and right, we're reaching a point of no return where only the best of the best countries will be left standing. Additionally, the Quarterfinals gave us a small glimpse into how the upcoming difficulty increases in the pools are going to shape each and every match as end game charts are introduced. Considering how strong of a first half we've been able to experience, who knows what the future holds as we begin to reach the final rounds!

It should not come as a surprise anymore than [Dynascape](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8784587), [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622), [Normiplier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10069850), and [akace100](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9308128) have prepared yet another video recap for us to enjoy. Quite a good watch during your train commute, if we do say so ourselves.

![Quarterfinals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-09-17-osumania-4k-world-cup-2025-quarterfinals-recap/mappool-qf.jpg)

The Quarterfinals added two new maps to the mix, those being a rice and a long note pick, leading to the overall map count clocking in at a total of 15. As to be expected, the charts this round were in general much harder than last week's.

The best starting point would be [YURiKA - Kyoumen no Nami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428540#mania/5287904) (RC6) by ::{ flag=ES }:: [Ska](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10313023). Taking up the vocal dump slot, seeing something like this in a tournament context from one of osu!mania's most well-renowned charters was surprising to say the least, even if their track record speaks for itself. It uses the typical unconventional and rather harsh approach you'd see in any other chart from Ska, but with special attention to an ever-changing pace that closely follows the song's intensity.

On the other hand, we have [Puru - Toki (maidable Remix) (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1306576#mania/5285589) (RC7) by ::{ flag=SG }:: [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707), which was one of the newest slots introduced this round. Its primary goal was to pair and minimise overlap with the rest of the miscellaneous tech picks. This map has existed for a long, *long* time, so many players were already familiar with it. For those who aren't, it's full of jacks with constant snap changes along with tight bursts, leading to an overall unpredictable chart.

Lastly, the best way to wrap up the map highlights would definitely be with [Camellia - PLANET//SHAPER (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428553#mania/5287927) (LN3) by ::{ flag=US }:: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576). Song choice aside, this slot was made to directly contrast with LN4. This year, the resulting chart ended up with a very shield-heavy approach, which certainly wasn't made any easier by the short 1/8 bursts and 1/6 LN segments all across the map.

Quarterfinals only gave us one [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music), but it's absolutely nothing to scoff at! [Sad Keyboard Guy & Myntian - Void//Shader (feat. xia)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428561#mania/5287940) charted by ::{ flag=CA }:: [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065), ::{ flag=TH }:: [MyZterioN-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8521723), and ::{ flag=US }:: [0DZ0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/28156707) was the first original tiebreaker for the tournament, and as such, was a **VERY** impressive piece of work. In typical tiebreaker fashion, this chart holds just about everything you'd expect from something with the goal to test all skill sets.

The chart itself isn't the only good thing to look at, as a massive amount of work went into making all the visuals and song as amazing as they are! With the illustration done by ::{ flag=CA }:: [Xiaoraini](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3607337), ::{ flag=CA }:: [RedcXca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601), and ::{ flag=AU }:: [tehfire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082924), graphic design by ::{ flag=CN }:: [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799), storyboard by ::{ flag=US }:: [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323), and the video being done by both ::{ flag=MY }:: [Iyouka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499) and ::{ flag=CN }:: [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) the team delivered far beyond what we could've expected.

During the weekend, we got a small glimpse into the environment we'll be seeing all throughout the closing half of the tournament. To say that the stakes have risen would be an understatement, even more so was the bump in difficulty when compared to last week's pools. However, it's hard to say how much this caught some teams by surprise, given that the average Joe would already be struggling to just pass these maps.

What we know for sure is that the extra challenge has made matches much, much more interesting to watch! We can only hope that also extended to the players themselves as they survived last week's gauntlet. And amongst all of the highlights, two matches in particular stood out from the rest.

### ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong vs. ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom

</div>

::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong and ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom were both coming off from comfortable wins on the winners' bracket, only conceding two points to ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru and one to ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina, respectively. However, coming into this match, both of these countries were going to have a much tougher challenge, as this was going to be a battle between top seeders.

The United Kingdom surged through a 3–0 lead, taking a win on [Ariabl'eyeS - Romanesque Romancia (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428522#mania/5287874) (RC3), a break point on [Camellia - PLANET//SHAPER (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428553#mania/5287927) (LN3), and also a victory on [Puru - Toki (maidable Remix) (Cut Ver.) [1.05x]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1306576#mania/5285589) (RC7). It's worth mentioning the amazing team score from the United Kingdom on RC7, with ::{ flag=GB }:: [eiEn_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24144271), ::{ flag=GB }:: [Zoobin4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10055204), and ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) securing the 2nd highest score among all countries, only being behind the United States.

It looked like they were going to be up 4–0, until a miracle (or curse) happened, as the entire United Kingdom team missed on Hong Kong's pick and protect, [Sangatsu no Phantasia - Golden Ray](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428545#mania/5287909) (LN1). This win gave Hong Kong the momentum, as they took a break point back on [Aquestion - Endro](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428517#mania/5287865) (RC2), not to mention the trio of ::{ flag=HK }:: [koshepen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17115114), ::{ flag=HK }:: [Kureha_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13471840) and ::{ flag=HK }:: [Quotient](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11313227) getting the highest team score on this chart. This was massive for Hong Kong, as they went with [Iro wa Jou e to Izanau](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428501#mania/5287813) (LN2), where they won by an inch (2.54 centimetres), at only 678 points.

With a tied score of 3–3 and the United Kingdom's pick being back on their hands, they immediately went with [Falcom sound team jdk - Grostos Castle (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428536#mania/5287896) (RC5), once again ending up a nail-biter, as they won this one by only a few thousand points. However, a curveball was made right after, with Hong Kong picking the chordjack-heavy [Cranky - Danger & Danger (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428525#mania/5287878) (RC4). Everyone in the lobby got a full combo; however, the triple (V1) SS of Hong Kong was more than enough to tip the balance, despite the United Kingdom's better ratios. 

Once again at a stalemate, the United Kingdom went for [YURiKA - Kyoumen no Nami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428540#mania/5287904) (RC6), and as per usual, it was another close call. The United Kingdom pulled through right at the very end, however, and with them now at match point, Hong Kong was left walking on the plank for the final pick of the match. They decided to choose [sakuraburst - cherry blossoms explode across the dying horizon (cut ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428541#mania/5287905) (HB3), but while this seemed like a good choice, the UK trio remained consistent and much more accurate than Hong Kong, dominating the scoreline at the very final pick to secure their placement on the winners' bracket.

Both the United Kingdom and the Hong Kong teams played extremely well and had a lot of things they were able to prove, with both sides dishing out scores topping the charts. However, the United Kingdom's consistency at the tail end of the match gave them the slight edge that became enough to attain victory. Good luck to both teams in their future matches!

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines

While both teams persevered throughout the losers' bracket despite their early losses, ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland and ::{ flag=PH }:: the Philippines were going to have one hell of a fight to determine who would be making it into the Semifinals. Despite the teams' unfortunate handicaps with their rosters and consistency throughout the tournament, they performed far above everyone's initial expectations during the match!

While the protect and ban phase went just as expected, Poland's pick of [sakuraburst - cherry blossoms explode across the dying horizon (cut ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428541#mania/5287905) (HB3) was not, given that it wasn't their preferred skill set. This was a tough gamble against Philippines's considerably balanced roster, ending up instead helping them getting their first break point. The Philippines then quickly followed up with their protect, LN1, leading to a nice and easy 0–2 in favour of the Philippines thanks to their pin-point long note accuracy.

Poland tried several times to get ahead of their rivals by using and abusing rice picks. This was first observed in their pick of [YURiKA - Kyoumen no Nami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428540#mania/5287904) (RC6). What they did not expect was that ::{ flag=PH }:: [Velyria-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9423922) and ::{ flag=PH }:: [lyvet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18121419) were about to pop off with 995k scores, letting the Philippines win their second break point, only followed by another victory on their own pick of LN4.

Even though the scoreboard was at 0–4, Poland refused to give up — third time's the charm, as they say. After picking [Ariabl'eyeS - Romanesque Romancia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428522) (RC3), the European team was able to maintain a triple full combo thanks to ::{ flag=PL }:: [klobuck](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29379793), ::{ flag=PL }:: [malza](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19141228), and ::{ flag=PL }:: [cycozgrzyt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11794749)'s amazing efforts, tallying the team's score up to 2,990k. By keeping up their momentum, they even managed to snatch a break point back from their rivals as the Philippines unfortunately found some trouble with LN2.

It was anyone's game at this point! Poland kept their pace up until they tied the game at 4–4. After such a nerve-wracking comeback, nobody could expect who was going to end up winning this match. Despite the Philippines taking the lead right back by winning on RC5, a tiebreaker was still not out of the question. Poland's last hopes were all placed on the Philippines' final pick, [metamorphosis - kinetic flux](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428538#mania/5287898) (HB2). Despite maintaining a tie during the first half, the Philippines were able to keep up their scores up to the very last minute, giving them a win they so desperately needed.

All in all, it is really difficult to express how exciting of a match this was. What could've been a fairly easy sweep ended up almost up in a tiebreaker. Poland's resilience under stress was commendable all throughout the match, not to mention their persistence during the tournament so far. We only hope they bounce back better than ever next year! As for the Philippines, congratulations to their team effort on these Quarterfinals.

## Score highlights

Where teams managed to cut it close during the Round of 16, they were sure to bring up the heat on this round as well. While we didn't see any score differences with less than 100 points, the maps turned out to be anything but easy-going for the teams, and it's impressive how competitive things are getting out in the arena. Just like last week, we have compiled the 10 closest maps in the below table:

| # |  |  | Map | Score diff | Pick by | Won by | Link |
| :-: | --: | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Thailand ::{ flag=TH }:: | ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan | RC1 | 170 | ::{ flag=TH }:: | ::{ flag=TH }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119202981 "Match history") |
| 2 | Thailand ::{ flag=TH }:: | ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan | RC3 | 314 | ::{ flag=TH }:: | ::{ flag=JP }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119202981 "Match history") |
| 3 | Poland ::{ flag=PL }:: | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines | RC1 | 415 | ::{ flag=PL }:: | ::{ flag=PL }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119203226 "Match history") |
| 4 | Hong Kong ::{ flag=HK }:: | ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom | LN2 | 698 | ::{ flag=HK }:: | ::{ flag=HK }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119206077 "Match history") |
| 5 | Russian Federation ::{ flag=RU }:: | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia | RC3 | 841 | ::{ flag=ID }:: | ::{ flag=ID }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119204968 "Match history") |
| 6 | Spain ::{ flag=ES }:: | ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru | LN2 | 907 | ::{ flag=PE }:: | ::{ flag=PE }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119207311 "Match history") |
| 7 | Malaysia ::{ flag=MY }:: | ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia | RC2 | 1,016 | ::{ flag=ID }:: | ::{ flag=ID }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119193826 "Match history") |
| 8 | Thailand ::{ flag=TH }:: | ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan | RC7 | 1,194 | ::{ flag=JP }:: | ::{ flag=TH }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119202981 "Match history") |
| 9 | Argentina ::{ flag=AR }:: | ::{ flag=ES }:: Spain | RC3 | 1,439 | ::{ flag=AR }:: | ::{ flag=ES }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119196396 "Match history") |
| 10 | Hong Kong ::{ flag=HK }:: | ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom | RC4 | 1,605 | ::{ flag=HK }:: | ::{ flag=HK }:: | [![#1](/wiki/shared/link/Link.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119206077 "Match history") |

At first glance you may notice that the match between ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand and ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan had not one, not two, but three of the top 10 closest maps throughout the whole round. While it may not look like it going by the final result, the scoreline could've been very different.

Thailand picking their protect of [Ariabl'eyeS - Romanesque Romancia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428522) (RC3) as the first map of the match ended up in a point for Japan. An unfortunate miss about halfway through the map gave Japan the lead, and from there, they just about managed to hold on even though the accuracies favoured the Thai roster.

Right after that map, the Japanese protect of [Puru - Toki (maidable Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1306576) (RC7) saw only a miss on both sides, leading to close scores right up until the very end, where the scales ultimately tipped in favour of Thailand.

And they weren't even the closest maps of the weekend! Right after those two break points, on [Azumi Takahashi feat. Lotus Juice - It's Going Down Now](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2428514) (RC1), the Japanese players all managed to keep their combos, looking to catch a third break point after another unfortunate miss from the Thai side. However, as the map came to a close, and with the accuracy lead on their side, Thailand managed to take the point by the skin of their teeth.

Whew. We don't know about you, but with such close victories and comebacks, we got to experience plenty of hype moments at the edge of our seats. In fact, the Quarterfinals had the smallest score differences on average of every weekend thus far, so it's exciting to think what we'll see going into future rounds.
