### osu!mania results

This contest came shortly after the conclusion of this year's [osu!mania 7K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K), so mappers had a relevant task: **design a 7K map with a style that fits a round and category (a.k.a. "slot") from [the latest osu!mania 7K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_7K)**.

The ~~3rd~~ ~~4th~~ 5th time's the charm. After **5** podium placements in different Monthly Beatmapping Contests, [oct4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10303887) has finally managed to join the ranks as one of osu!'s *Elite Mappers*.

[tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) deserves praise for winning too of course, but he's already won enough Monthly Beatmapping Contests to earn the *Elite Mapper* title months ago!

Additionally, following our collaboration with [7K GLOBAL's bi-monthly event](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2065328?n=1), we'd like to congratulate the mappers who'll make it into the event's pool — including those who didn't make it into the contest itself! While we cannot announce the pool in advance, stay tuned in the forum post to discover the event's winners.

And of course, we can't forget the folks who helped judge this month's contest: [ExNeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7590894), [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785), [Tailsdk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6751666), [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), and [_Kobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713)!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

As the Sun gets ever so closer to the Earth for this year's summer solstice, we're going to honour the occasion by **reaching for the stars**! May as well take the chance while it's easier to do so.

For this month's contest, mappers must design and submit a **4K map** that aims to have the highest **star rating** possible. While such a limitation by itself would be easy to achieve, you will need to keep the following rules in mind:

- **Submissions must not be impossible.** Maps are supposed to be reasonably challenging, but not unfairly so — they are supposed to be played after all!
- **Long notes cannot make up more than 1/3 of the beatmap.** It wouldn't be a challenge if we were able to abuse staggered releases.
- **Focus on making a good beatmap first and foremost.** This month's challenge is about optimising the map's star rating, but this should not come at the expense of the overall quality of the map.

If you're confused about how this works, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to resident key smasher [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063)!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation/theme](#limitation):** *aim to achieve the highest star rating possible.*
  - **Submissions must be in 4K.**
  - **Submissions must not be impossible.** Maps are supposed to be reasonably challenging, but not unfairly so — they are supposed to be played after all!
  - **Long notes cannot make up more than 1/3 of the beatmap.** It wouldn't be a challenge if we were able to abuse staggered releases.
  - **Focus on making a good beatmap first and foremost.** This month's challenge is about optimising the map's star rating, but this should not come at the expense of the overall quality of the map.
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
