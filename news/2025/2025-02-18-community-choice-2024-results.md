Rev up the drumrolls as we crown 2024's Community Choice and Mapper's Favourite beatmaps for each mode!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/231/header.jpg)

[In case you've missed it](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-30-community-choice-2024-voting-open) (or are living under a rock), the *Community Choice* polls are a yearly event where players and mappers alike come to unity in order to determine which maps of the past year were the best of the best.

As per tradition, winners of the *Community Choice* and *Mapper's Favourite* categories across all categories (with the exception of osu!mania xK) will be receiving a 6-month osu!supporter tag (3 months for osu!mania 7K) split among them, alongside a bespoke profile badge to commemorate their achievement.

The rest of the top 10 (top 5 for osu!mania 7K) for each *Community Choice* category will also be receiving a 1-month osu!supporter tag each.

Tallying **95,562** total votes from **12,615** users across all game modes, you've made your voice heard, and it's time to reveal *your* choices for the best beatmaps of 2024!

If you're more of a visual learner, here's a showcase of all winning beatmaps in action:

Taking the [osu! World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2023) by storm, [ktgster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/53378) brought us an absolute banger of a map (featuring difficulties from [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929), [Cytusine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11557554), [IOException](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2688103), [Serenhaide](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10466315), [Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119507), [squirrelpascals](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6151332), and [Nytrocide_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11327918)) that currently houses what's commonly referred as the best tournament score of all-time: a 99.01% accuracy FC on OWC 2023's Grand Finals HR3 pick, which was set by none other than [worst hr player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14106450) against the almighty United States OWC team.

This score has left such a significant mark on the community that it resonated enough with players to be voted as the *Community Choice* for 2024.

In case you need a refresher, here's the glorious score that cemented this map's legacy:

With [**BilliumMoto - LIGHT LEFT BEHIND**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2062241) by [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), debuting in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K), it appears like the community had a knack for more [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) this 2024.

Besides the traction gained from its tournament debut, users from all skill levels loved the spread! With a full suite of difficulties and a very fun fast-paced, technical hybrid to top things off, this set was bound to garner the attention of many players.

Arguably a contender for [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196)'s magnum opus, with the help of [tyrcs](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13026904) and [Schopfer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11270477) [**Ludicin - Everlasting Eternity**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2099753) quickly became one of the most admired 7K maps of the year despite being ranked during the lattermost quarter of 2024.

For many, this is the epitome of 7K mapping when it comes to tiebreak-styled maps. It is an extremely challenging, full-flavour experience with plenty of variety to spare! With the help of [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436)'s storyboard to bring the map to life, this was an unforgettable experience for the few able to withstand the gauntlet.
