Blend a bit of drum, a pinch of bass, and some amphibian wit together to create **hikota**, our newest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/463/header.jpg)

Latvian musician **hikota** is a master of mood-setting. Mixing inspiration from video game soundtracks with a specialty in atmospheric drum & bass, jungle, and occassional vocaloid thrown into the mix, **hikota**'s unique combination of skills lends to a one-of-a-kind bass-oriented listen.

[**hikota**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/463) has a grand total of **27** tracks, each timed in advance for your next session in the editor.
