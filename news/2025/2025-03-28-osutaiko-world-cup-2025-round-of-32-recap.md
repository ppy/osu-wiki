And it doesn't stop there... after [Fraser Edwards](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/339) themselves joined the reveal live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive), they posted a [sneak peek of their brand-new music video](https://x.com/Fraser_Edwards/status/1900556340335886355) featuring this song on their Twitter. Definitely something to look forward to when it finally releases.

One of the first matches we saw this weekend was between Finland (#14) and France (#19). Starting off strong into the tournament with a match of this calibre was definitely intense to watch, as both teams fought for their spot in the winner's bracket.

After a very confident looking start from the Finnish team on the French team's pick [femtanyl - ATTACKING VERTICAL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340354#taiko/5028107) (NM5), their own pick [namigroove, Kotonoha Akane&Aoi - Mugen Dara Dara Gandhara (feat. Kotonoha Akane&Aoi)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340368#taiko/5028132) (FM2) and then another pick by France, which earned them a break point on [Hiiragi Magnetite - TETORIS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2277268#taiko/4874450) (HD2), the French team finally picked up the pace and tried their best to get on the board. With success!

On [MetaHumanBoi - Speed Bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340349#taiko/5028101) (NM3), the speed map of the pool, both ::{ flag=FR }:: [YaniFR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11260982)'s and ::{ flag=FR }:: [Nethen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14034809)'s efforts to full combo the map with high accuracy paid off, getting them their first point. Things seemed brighter for France from here on out, as they also secured their second point on their next pick [METAROOM - ICON KILLER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340351#taiko/5028104) (NM2).

Finland reacted fast, picked their next map [Tokiwa - Syuou Sange](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340359#taiko/5028114) (HR1) and won the accuracy battle which got them their fourth point. Now at match point and victory ever so close, the French had one last chance to prove themselves. They had to act, which they did. A quick pick of [t+pazolite with Kabocha - Elder Dragon Legend](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2113078#taiko/4436620) (NM1) earned the French team their third point, putting more pressure on Finland.

Confidently, Finland went with [Nishino Kana - Darling](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288836#taiko/4884307) (DT2), and after many score switches between both teams and 6 full combos on the board, players ::{ flag=FI }:: [BFKB113PBK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13613362), ::{ flag=FI }:: [Antti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13281473), and ::{ flag=FI }:: [GamersDecision](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19975342) carried their team to victory, by winning the accuracy battle once again!

Needless to say, it was a very intense match, both for the teams playing and the viewers and casters spectating live. How they're going to perform in the upcoming matches will definitely be something to look forward to.

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=VN }:: Vietnam

One of the closer matches of this week, Poland (#15) and Vietnam (#18) have definitely held their own in this match.

Vietnam had a very strong start, scoring themselves a 4–0 lead before Poland could even get on the board with solid sweeps on [Nishino Kana - Darling](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2288836#taiko/4884307) (DT2) [Kobaryo & Matatabi Sound System + DJ NECOJITA + Shinonome I/F + blaxervant - HARD-COREMATA (HVS VER.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2193212#taiko/4672708) (HR2), [Sound Souler - Eternalism 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340352#taiko/5028105) (HD1), and [MetaHumanBoi - Speed Bomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340349#taiko/5028101) (NM3).

However, we cannot deny that team Poland held their own during the NM3 match, pulling ahead with a very close lead yet unfortunately losing it in the end. Despite their FC on the map alongside ::{ flag=PL }:: [bernard351](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9511518) dropping a very impressive SS, it was not enough to go against Vietnam's wrath.

With match point in hand, Poland needed to act fast against Vietnam's pick [Tokiwa - Syuou Sange](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340359#taiko/5028114) (HR1), and luckily, Poland's tech prowess won them a very solid score lead!

Poland wasn't ready to give up just yet, as they decided to double down on their tech skills via picking the rhythmically challenging [METAROOM - ICON KILLER](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340351#taiko/5028104) (NM2). However, this manoeuvre turned out to be very risky for them, as Vietnam surprisingly held a solid score lead throughout the majority of the map. Luckily, the ending wasn't merciful for Vietnam, as Poland managed to barely clutch the tricky rhythm switches that doomed Vietnam's fate on the map.

Unfortunately, Poland's hopes were dashed as Vietnam locked in for their final pick [seatrus - Blank society](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340369#taiko/5028136) (NM4), and managed to secure their spot in the winners' bracket.
