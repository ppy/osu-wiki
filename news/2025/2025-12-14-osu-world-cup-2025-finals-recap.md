Excitement and anticipation were through the roof for the osu! World Cup 2025 Finals. For the first time ever, the top 6 seeds made up the last 6 of the bracket, set to face off in a match week that was unprecedented in scope. One question remained to be answered: would it live up to the hype?

In the winners' Finals, #1 seed Poland faced off against #2 seed United States. The former was seeking their first Grand Final since 2017, having already achieved their first podium since that same year. The latter was looking for redemption after failing to win the tournament in 2024 for the first time in 7 years. Meanwhile, Australia, Canada, Germany, and South Korea would fight tooth and nail in the losers' bracket for the coveted final spot on the podium. All had glory in their sights, but only one team could win the two matches required to reach Grand Finals week.

This week's mappool had a lot of... maps. In the pool... The mappool...

Yeah, let's go with that. After five of these you run out of ways to introduce this section.

For existing maps this time around, the DnB classic [Epiphany](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/307163#osu/687303) and the funky [Maritime Police](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/681410#osu/1440743) both graced the DT pool this week. Both maps were high points of difficulty in the pool, as Epiphany gave us the highest pp play in OWC history, and Maritime Police gave us an almost 9-star map in what isn't even the last pool of the tournament. Elsewhere in the pool, stream map [Arkadia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1946135#osu/4026393) and aim map [DEAFHEAVEN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2410556#osu/5234131) also rounded out the pool's mechanical side a bit more.

As for the notable customs, there were quite a few. [Sparkle Dancer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471991#osu/5416150) provided an interesting, very active alt map for the freemod pool, mapped by former top U.S. player [Axarious](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2614511), while [Kitsune no Yomeiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471973#osu/5416121) and [Zephyrs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471977#osu/5416125) were two hidden maps that provided pattern aim and flow aim, respectively. Alongside [\<header\>](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471970#osu/5416117), a big No Mod reading and snap aim test, all the maps described in this paragraph were picked in every match this week.

---

We also had a grand total of **four** [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) this week, so let's tackle each one of them from top to bottom.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-14-osu-world-cup-2025-finals-recap/inorganic_dystopia_banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471967#osu/5416113)

    </audio>
</div>

Firstly, new featured artist [XenjeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/482) gave us an aggressive, hard-hitting electronic banger in [Inorganic Dystopia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471967#osu/5416113). Mapped by [9ami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1499997), [ralsricat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12318332) and [Matsuyuki Ame](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12763959), this is one truly crazy tech experience.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-14-osu-world-cup-2025-finals-recap/ruby_of_twilight_banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471980#osu/5416133)

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/359/Songs/cygnus_-_The_Ruby_of_Twilight.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

Second on the list, returning from 2023, it's our old friend [cygnus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/359), bringing us an active yet still somber electronic piece in [The Ruby of Twilight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471980#osu/5416133). Mapped by [LMT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262798), the map used the song's 1/8 rhythms mixed with a precision challenge in Hard Rock to make for an extremely unique challenge. The map also features a really cool storyboard, so check it out!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-14-osu-world-cup-2025-finals-recap/open_scar_unending_banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471983#osu/5416139)

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/220/Songs/Marmalade_butcher_-_Open_Scar_Unending.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

Next up, it was finally OWC's turn for a [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220) song, as the band has so far produced an original for every other world cup this year. [Open Scar Unending](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471985#osu/5416144) plays with guitar, distortion and rhythm in a way only Marmalade butcher can, which made for a very active song and for an aggressive and dissonant map (aesthetically) from [revoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8165181), which only became more emphasized through being a forced Hard Rock pick.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-14-osu-world-cup-2025-finals-recap/gumbarlzo_banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2472011#osu/5416200)

</div>

Lastly, but certainly not least...ly? The one and only [t+pazolite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/396) was responsible for this week's tiebreaker — and boy, did he deliver. The simultaneously intense and nostalgic (not to spoil much) [Gumbarlzo!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2472011#osu/5416200) was, undoubtedly, an amazing way to cap off any match played this week. The map, the storyboard, the designs; all of them are also phenomenal, and have a ton of people (far too many to be reasonably listed here) that helped make it as good as it turned out. Check out who contributed to this project in the description and make sure to give the map itself a try!

## Finals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **Canada** ::{ flag=CA }:: | **7** | 4 | ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea |
| **Australia** ::{ flag=AU }:: | **7** | 2 | ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany |
| **Australia** ::{ flag=AU }:: | **7** | 3 | ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada |
| **Poland** ::{ flag=PL }:: | **7** | 6 | ::{ flag=US }:: United States |

While the osu! World Cup is contested by teams of eight players, the story of the losers' bracket this week was one of solo carry performances. Each of the three matches in the lower side would be defined by standout showings as the late stage scaling of the tournament's best was put to the test.

In the first match, seed #4 Canada vs seed #6 South Korea, one of the greatest aim players in the history of the tournament scene added another stamp to her sterling legacy. Canada's greatest-ever tournament player ::{ flag=CA }:: [xootynator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598) was at her best in this matchup: she topped the lobby with a 653,179 4-miss play on the full-screen aim [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2410556#osu/5234131) before getting FCs on both the awkward aim consistency [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471973#osu/5416121) and the alt snap aim [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471991#osu/5416150) pick, helping Canada easily win all three en route to a 7–4 victory.

Despite an eventual loss, ::{ flag=DE }:: [criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659) continued to stand out — as he had for the entire tournament — in Germany's match against Australia. He top-scored 6 of the 8 maps he played for his team in a match featuring multiple thrilling duels between him and Australian top performer ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902). On back-to-back picks of [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471977#osu/5416125) and [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471985#osu/5416144) ::{ flag=DE }:: [criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659) and ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) were the top performers for their teams; the results, a 75,107 win for Australia on the former and a 21,896 win for Germany on the latter, could hardly have been any closer. Australia would eventually take the match by a seemingly routine final score of 7–2, but with five of those nine maps decided by under 200,000 points, the match was truly a competitive one despite the scoreline.

The ::{ flag=AU }:: [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) show was on full display in the final match of the losers' bracket as Australia and Canada took the stage with a spot in the Grand Finals week on the line. He took the lobby by storm in a manner befitting his stature as one of the greatest of all time. An FC and the OWC pp record of 968pp on the skillcap consistency pick of [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/307163#osu/687303); an absurd 1-miss 98.58% accuracy run on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471977#osu/5416125); an FC on the burst tapping [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471992#osu/5416151) — these are just a few highlights of a simply stunning performance put on by the world's #1 player. When all was said and done, Australia sent the new-look Canadian team home by a score of 7–3, but the future looks bright for a Canada roster that featured 5 OWC rookies.

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=US }:: United States

[**View the match information here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/120021463)

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2637864390&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false&time=1h36m55s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

For six weeks of the osu! World Cup 2025, an air of inevitability surrounded discussion of the winners' bracket finalists. Poland and the United States were the heavy pre-tournament favorites, and their respective inexorable marches through the bracket culminated in the matchup fans had waited for since the rosters were announced. Each team looked nigh-unstoppable; Poland boasted the top player in the tournament thus far in ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961), while the United States continued to rely on the kind of depth in their roster that led them to 10 straight top-2 finishes in OWC. Stylistically, the teams had much in common, both being the strongest teams in the world in every skillset imaginable and lacking any obvious weaknesses.

The match had the highest of expectations placed upon it, and it more than lived up to them. Each team won their first picks — the alt-focused [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/681410#osu/1440743) for Poland and the flow and wiggle aim tech [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471977#osu/5416125) for the United States — comfortably enough, but the match took off from there. The third map, an aim challenge in the form of [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471973#osu/5416121), was on a knife's edge the entire way through, with the teams taking turns holding on to big combos with Poland finally eking out a win by under 30,000 points.

Seemingly baited into selecting the snap aim reading test of [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471970#osu/5416117) second after Poland banned out HD2, the United States' lone FC on the pick by ::{ flag=US }:: [EthantrixV3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348) was matched by ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961), who was additionally supported by a near-FC from ::{ flag=PL }:: [milosz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13108233) and solid supporting scores from ::{ flag=PL }:: [evil grape](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16139008) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [honeydip](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14100781) (better known as sharytory and hav, respectively). When the dust settled, Poland had stolen a break point for a 3–1 lead heading into their next pick: more snap aim, this time via [Axarious](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2614511)' custom map [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471991#osu/5416150). Bolstered by a 1-miss 974,540 score from their captain, Poland won to consolidate the break point — all they'd need to do was win their own picks the rest of the way to emerge victorious.

The United States would not go away quite so easily as all that. The match settled into a tightly contested rhythm punctuated by several close maps: the United States picked more flow with [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471985#osu/5416144), winning it by just 61,990; Poland selected the slidertech [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471967#osu/5416113) and won it by 50,768.

Following a precision pick on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471980#osu/5416133) won by the United States to take the score to 5–3, the tides finally turned in their favor. Poland's second to last pick of the match was the antimod [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471996#osu/5416170), and it was none other than ::{ flag=US }:: [BoshyMan741](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4830687) who played hero for the U.S., full comboing the map to finally reclaim the break point they had dropped seemingly hours prior. Following a four-way combo reset from Poland, the United States followed up with a win on the stream pick of [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1946135#osu/4026393) in dramatic fashion to send the match into the last pick for each team.

Poland opted into the tapping and aim consistency DT1, and who else would it be but ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) to top score the lobby with a 953,672 1-miss play? Poland had secured tiebreaker at worst with a single match point at 6–5 on the United States' final pick of the match. The Americans made that pick an anticlimactic one, selecting the consistency aim pick [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2471966#osu/5416105) and dominating it to the tune of a 308,034 win.

A match tinged with inevitability had at long last reached its thrilling climax: the tiebreaker, an unbelievably difficult tech map set to the tune of the [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) track [Gumbarlzo! by t+pazolite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2472011#osu/5416200). In classic Poland style, it was ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [gnahus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12779141) who would lead the way. Keeping their nerve and holding their combo, the pair set the top two scores in the lobby as both eventually finished above the 400,000-point mark, establishing a lead through the first third of the map that would prove to be decisive. The United States did all they could to scratch and claw their way back, but it was not meant to be. Poland held on, and the final score came to 7–6 in what can only be described as the match of the tournament. After eight long years, Poland were back in the Grand Finals of the osu! World Cup.

This year's OWC, we welcome the debut of a new World Cup storyboarder. [Raybean](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16676388) took on the Finals Tiebreaker [Gumbarlzo!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2472011#osu/5416200) and produced an outstanding storyboard for the showcase. However, this isn't their first rodeo contributing to osu! originals. Their past work includes the graphic design for [FOXGLOVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318030#mania/4964416) in MWC 7K 2025 and the illustration for [Resonance of Ice Stalactites](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2373140#osu/5124199) in LGA 2025.

It's always inspiring seeing new faces in the storyboarding community. Since this is your first World Cup project as a storyboarder, could you introduce yourself and share your previous design experience?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16676388" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Raybean.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16676388">Raybean</a></p>

Hello, I'm Raybean! In the osu! sphere, I am mostly known as a graphic designer and illustrator. I've been doing graphic design for osu! tournaments since 2022, and I've started making art for some maps since 2024. You may have seen my work in some of the earlier World Cups this year, such as [FOXGLOVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318030#mania/4964416) in MWC 7K, [HYPER PSY2K](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2351106#taiko/5059418) in TWC, as well as this year's 6 Digit World Cup where I worked on the storyboard for the Grand Finals tiebreaker [Resplendence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2436259#osu/5311353). I was also the co-host and lead designer for India's first osu! LAN tournament, the [osu!Chennai Beachside Showdown](https://ocbs.rrex.cc/), and for [Fruit Loops Tournaments](https://wybin.xyz/fruitloops4/home), a battle royale tournament series aimed at beginner osu!catch players.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kuroise-2.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14547127">Kuroise</a></p>

This project featured a variety of sections in the storyboard that each felt unique, fitting the festival theme that is present. How was the workflow for this project handled? Were there any parts you found particularly challenging?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16676388" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Raybean.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16676388">Raybean</a></p>

The workflow for this project was a little different from what I think tiebreakers are usually like. For the past few years, the stinger used before presenting an osu! original featured a snippet from the Grand Finals tiebreaker, but this time we used the Finals tiebreaker instead. As a result, we planned out the vibe of the storyboard much earlier. We divided the song into multiple sections based on its structure and planned what would happen in each part accordingly. Some called for simpler scenes such as panning through the backgrounds, while the drops called for something more intense, such as after Mani's introduction earlier in the song.

Since we already had assets prepared from the stinger, it helped a lot with the early stages of planning and setting the scene. As time went on, we experimented more and explored creative ideas that leaned a little on the sillier side while still maintaining the festival theme, as requested by [t+pazolite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/396) himself. I'm really glad I got to be part of a project that allowed us to be more playful and creative with our storyboarding, rather than leaning heavily into the more gameplay-focused or technical approaches we've used in the past. We even looked at a lot of older storyboards for inspiration!

I think the main challenge we faced was fixating on a single section of the storyboard for too long.  I was especially guilty of this with the Cheatreal reveal. I spent an unreasonable amount of time adjusting sprite movement, tweaking easings, shifting things by a few milliseconds, and ultimately getting lost in the fine details. Kuro, you taught me something incredibly valuable: if you get stuck, delete the section and start over from scratch. I saw firsthand how effective that advice was when watching you work on your parts.

Before this storyboard, you worked on past World Cup designs as an illustrator and graphic designer. How did the transition from making your past designs to making a fully fledged storyboard make you feel? How different is making animated backgrounds from still images?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16676388" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Raybean.jpg')"></a>

Honestly, after working in graphic design and illustration, storyboarding felt like the natural next step. It's yet another way to express creativity within the game. I had wanted to try storyboarding for osu! ever since I was a newer player back in 2020, but the resources available at the time were limited and mostly focused on coding tutorials, which discouraged me from picking it up for a long while. It wasn't until this year that I finally decided to give it a try, thanks to your storyboarding document and your work on [BUZZ CUTZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2358247#taiko/5080724), and especially because you became my storyboarding mentor throughout the process.

Having prior illustration and graphic design experience definitely gave me a head start in the learning process. When you reached out asking if I was interested in storyboarding for this project, I was extremely excited but also incredibly nervous, since I had only just begun learning how to storyboard earlier this year. Still, I'm glad I put my fears aside and accepted the project. It involved a lot of learning, and it was a lot of fun as well.

Because of my background in graphic design, I'd say I already understood the aesthetic foundations of storyboarding: composition, contrast, hierarchy, and similar principles. But storyboarding adds two new dimensions to your work: movement and time. I had to learn how to create animated scenes, ensure the sprites moved in ways that matched the music, and make sure everything remained cohesive as a whole. And, as the name suggests, you can even choose to tell a story through your storyboard, or focus more on visual appeal... or both!

With four illustrators working across multiple scenes, this project grew into a huge collection of festival moments and character interactions.

Hey everyone I'm RedcXca, but people usually call me Red! I'm a Canadian osu!catch player and illustrator currently studying software engineering at the University of Waterloo, and I have a cat named Milky! I got introduced to osu! back in 2019 through my classmate Rijrya who challenged me to pass the hard difficulty of [This Game](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/749557#osu/1604183) in standard. It wasn't long before I realized I liked real rhythm game modes more, so I switched to osu!catch and have been playing it ever since, peaking at global rank 45 earlier this year. You may know me from my illustrations to the community such as the osu! fanart contests (particularly the beach episode) or my illustrations for all the World Cups. There's always something sus about them... Since joining the design team in 2023, I've had the pleasure of bringing many projects like Gumbarlzo! to life working with amazing artists like Hiro, celes, and Kourihase! I'm excited to share the details of this work with you all.

Hello! my name is celes (short for celestial), and I have been a part of the osu! community since 2016 when someone introduced me to a [Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493) replay at a smash tournament lol. I play all game modes (except for 7K...), but I'm mostly a standard player :3 I have been a digital illustrator online since basically the dawn of time, starting out on various oekaki boards and providing art for miscellaneous gaming communities. Since joining the osu! scene, I have had the opportunity to meet tons of talented individuals and provide illustrations for a variety of tournaments including the World Cups, Battle of the Box, Wonderland Cup, and a few LANs here and there!

Hi, I'm Hiro (you can just call me Hiro). I don't actively play osu! nowadays. I originally started because of taiko, but that phase didn't last long, haha. Even so, I found myself enjoying the creative side of the community, and that eventually led me to draw for World Cups.

Morning! I'm Kourihase (just call me Kouri). I've been playing osu! since 2018, though I became extra active during the COVID era because I didn't know what else to do with my time. Most people I met during that time were very nice, but they've now moved on with their own life. Nowadays, I mostly participate in osu! fanart contests, and artwork for some osu! tournaments here and there, for example, [bailie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133)'s [The Endless Twindrill Octave](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2107391). Fun fact, I wouldn't be drawing today if I didn't play osu!, mainly because I bought my Wacom tablet to get better at the game, but instead I was diagnosed with skill issue.

We finally have another project featuring all osu! mascots, and each of you approached them through different styles. From chibi illustrations to full body illustrations, there were a variety of character assets being produced. How did you interpret the mascots in your illustrations? In what ways do you feel your illustration style came through in the way you portrayed them?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/RedcXca.jpg')"></a>

This was quite a fun challenge for me as I usually only draw girls in :) or :0 expressions. For this project, I really wanted to push the range of emotions for the characters to match the energetic and festive settings of the song, drawing them in more dynamic poses and expressions. I focused on giving each mascot a unique personality that would fit the summer festival theme, like making Mocha the cheerful and lively center of attention, while giving Mani a more cool and composed vibe.

My illustration style leans on the messier side with no lineart and vibrant colours, which I think helped bring out the mood of the festival. I also tend to use lots of saturated colours and strong lighting to make the characters pop against the background, ensuring they stand out in the busy festival scenes.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9108428" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/[celes].jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9108428">[celes]</a></p>

I tend to draw a lot of bishounen, so drawing girls can be a bit of a struggle for me sometimes. During the early stages of the main cover art, I worked together with RedcXca, and the team mentioned that my version of pippi looked a little too well-endowed. That's how we ended up deciding to place Mocha in the center instead, which actually fit the summer festival vibe of the song really well. As for the illustration I made for Yuzu, I just wanted the osu! boys to have more screen time and to make them as hot as possible. Titan pippi isn't real, titan pippi can't hurt you.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13298982" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kourihase.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13298982">Kourihase</a></p>

I think my portrayal of each mascot succeeded. Perchance. I wanted to bring out each of their unique personalities, like with Mocha's silly cat face, Mani's prideful DJ aura farming, and pippi being pippi. pippi blast RAHHH.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15251809" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/HiROdoge.jpg')"></a>

I am honored to be the costume designer for this project. While Kouri made chibi illustrations, I made full body illustrations for all the mascots. It was hard making a unique design for each character so I'm glad they turned out well! When it comes to designing, making props or deciding key visual, I usually rely heavily on references. Thanks to the team for brainstorming and sharing visual ideas, we were able to come out with assets with each of our unique style. Other than the mascots, I also made a variety of backgrounds for the storyboarders to use. (Someone please stop Red from adding Among Us on every design)

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Sakura006.jpg')"></a>

Aside from the mascots themselves, the festival setting also helped to shape the mood. We saw food stalls, decorations, props, and even Taikonator. A lot of these supporting assets were created to further enhance the vibes. How did you approach designing the backgrounds, festival details, and the mascots' outfits? Were there particular choices you made to match the energy of the song?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/RedcXca.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601">RedcXca</a></p>

I took a lot of inspiration from classic Japanese summer festivals and tried to incorporate into the backgrounds and props. For this project I wanted to make sure the busy, chaotic and somewhat funky vibes of the song were reflected in the illustrations, so I overstuffed the background and used lots of elements like fireworks, lanterns, and random fruits to create that immersive festival atmosphere. It took some trial and error to balance the colours without losing the characters in the background, but I think we managed to pull it off well!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15251809" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/HiROdoge.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15251809">HiROdoge</a></p>

Similar to my previous answer, I just went through the reference and decide the assets style and background visual. Since the track is 6 minutes, I couldn't afford to make specific backgrounds or decorations, that's why most of the assets I've made are designed to be usable in a lot of scenarios for the video and for the storyboard. All the props (including big Taikonator!) are based on the Japanese festival vibe so they fit everywhere. Although each artist slightly deviated from the original design, the core concept of each character was given by me so I'm really proud of that. I wasn't really trying to match a specific energy but instead go for a "let's have fun!" vibe.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9108428" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/[celes].jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9108428">[celes]</a></p>

To be honest, I took a lot of inspiration and notes from how Hiro designed the outfits and backgrounds, which came out amazing. Character designs and backgrounds are definitely not my strong suit, so I relied a lot on 3d modelling for the backgrounds I worked on. I think I definitely learned and grew a lot from this project though, and I am super happy with how our project turned out!

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13298982" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kourihase.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13298982">Kourihase</a></p>

The full body and chibi concept arts were quite different. Hiro originally made the concept art for both chibi and full body illustrations, but that ended up being changed. Since the design was themed around a festival, I figured to have them wear their personalities while also representing their respective game mode. I also snuck some Touhou references in there, go figure. Other than that, the project turned out very well, and I hope that we can continue to step up our game yet again for the next major osu! tournament. And for all reading this, please APPLY AND JOIN THE DESIGN TEAM. LOCK IN AND DO IT. Our recruitment news post will be out soon. That's all, bye~~
