42 teams have created beatmaps with original songs and visuals, and now is your turn to decide which did it the best!

![](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025/img/banner.jpg)

In case you missed the previous news posts ([#1](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-31-locus), [#2](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-04-14-locus-2025-update-1) and [#3](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-06-03-locus-2025-update-2)) or have forgotten, Locus is a multi-layered contest launched in early 2025 to bring the creative circles on osu! closer together.

During the entry phase of January 31 to June 30, participants formed teams to create an *original beatmap experience* from scratch, in order to be judged on song quality, map quality and visual presentation.

The ones to deliver that judgement will be anyone who receives this message, and you have until **Saturday, August 16 (12:00 UTC)** to contribute with your vote! If you're interested, read on! If you first need a sample for what the entries have to offer, read no more (but then please continue reading afterwards):

### How to vote

Simply head to the [**Locus voting website**](https://locus.yui.tv/vote) created specifically for this contest and log in with your osu! account. You will be assigned **5 random entries** to rank across 3 categories: *music*, *visuals* and *mapping*.

</div>

This means you don't need to look at all 42 entries in order to vote (but feel free to [check them all out](#entries) anyway!).

Before voting, you'll need to **select a difficulty level to vote for** between Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane and Expert. Then, you'll need to **pass the 5 maps assigned to you** at the difficulty level you selected, without any difficulty-reducing mods (specifically, you may not use anything outside HR, SD, PF, DT, NC, HD, FL, BL, ST, AC, CL, MR, AL and SG, but, you may pick a difficulty-reducing mod for one map).

Note that since mapping quality tends to take more creative form at higher difficulties, votes for the higher difficulties will be weighted more in the mapping category.

For people who prefer to play the maps without distractions and experience the music and visuals separately, there is a video preview of each map on the voting page. For everyone else, please **enable storyboards and videos** for the full experience!

Finally, reorder the entries on the voting page from best to worst in each category according to your opinion. Please consider carefully, as you won't be able to edit your vote after submitting.

### The Elo rating system

When you've casted your votes, they will be ranked according to an [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), similar to how chess or *most* competitive games rank players (but not our beloved circle clicking game... *yet*)

This involves a lot of complicated math, but it essentially works based on wins and losses between entries. The more an entry is consistently ranked higher than other entries (as determined by voters comparing 5 entries at a time), the higher it'll appear on the final ranking!

While the teams were busy creating their maps, we did a test run to illustrate how this system would work, where voters were tasked to rank osu! World Cup tiebreakers. You can read more about it and check how the leaderboard turned out on the [Locus 2025 wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025#trial-voting).
