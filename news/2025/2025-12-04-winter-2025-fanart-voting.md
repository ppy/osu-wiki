It's December! For the latest and greatest holiday season, **129** artists have come together to draw winter-themed artwork. It's time for **you** to decide which of them will be the winners!

Unfortunately you only get **15** votes to pick your favourites. We know, the Halloween horrors were supposed to be over, but fortunately you get a neat showcase video to quickly peruse all the entries to the tune of *Chata - Snow white syndrome*:

Voting closes a week from now (**December 12 (18:00 UTC)**), after which both the community and the winning artists themselves get presents (i.e. prizes):

- A selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu**.
- Top-voted entries will receive **3 months of osu!supporter**.
- The top 3 will receive bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations.
- The top 3 will also be featured as [**limited-time default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations), with the ones from last round rotating out.

Eternal thanks, as always, to everyone who puts in their time to submit for this contest, since we wouldn't be here without you!

That's all for now, time to lock in your votes!
