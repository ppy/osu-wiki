Welcome to the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*), the beatmapping contest that runs every month. While we're not very original with our names, we expect **osu!** and **osu!mania** mappers to produce original maps this month:

### Limitation

The spirit of competition involves competing on equal grounds. That's part of why we have *limitations*: extra rules that guide how every participant creates their map.

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (for osu!) or [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=7080063) (for osu!mania).

#### osu!

We hit a milestone today: *5 years of Monthly Beatmapping Contests!* (We actually reached the milestone last month, but let's not worry about the details.)

To celebrate this milestone, we'll be returning to our roots.

This contest's limitation is the same as [January 2020's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-01-05-monthly-beatmapping-contests-return): **all slider shapes must be straight lines.**

![limitation example](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-05-monthly-beatmapping-contest-returns/limitation.png)

#### osu!mania

For no particular reason, this month's contest is about **the number 6**.

**Submissions must be 6K.** Moreover, single note, long note, and total object counts **must include the number 6**.

*But wait, there's more.* Single note, long note, and total object counts must also **be divisible by 6**.

For example, a map with 15**6** single notes, 4**6**2 long notes, and **6**18 total notes is a perfect fit. Each of those numbers include a 6, and if you divide any of them by 6, they will result in a whole number.

The math behind this might be confusing. If you're a math person, you can read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic#Congruence) for details. If not, you can check out [this object count calculator](https://mappersguild.com/contests/mbc) to verify if your map fits the requirements.

Best of luck to all mappers.

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](#limitation):**
  - **osu!:** all slider shapes must be straight lines.
  - **osu!mania:** single note, long note, and total object counts **must include a 6** and **must be divisible by 6**.
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).** For osu!'s limitation, follow this in the most ambiguous way possible.
- **Submissions must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
