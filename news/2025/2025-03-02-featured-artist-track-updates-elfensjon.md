There are more songs being produced every minute than you could possible listen to. Lucky for you, **ELFENSJoN**'s latest batch of J-Rock tracks is all any mapper could ask for.

Over 5 years ago, [**ELFENSJoN** joined our Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-02-19-new-featured-artist-elfensjon), mixing crispy-clean classic instrumentation and stellar lyrics from vocalists throughout Japan's doujin music scene.

Today, we've brought **ELFENSJoN**'s newest album *ZENITH* into osu!, including the familiar voices of *Hanatan*, [*Annabel*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/234), *konoko*, and *KOOL*! We also snuck in an extra track because we could: *Hotarubi (REINCARNATE ver)*.

In any case, all **9** new tracks are part of [**ELFENSJoN**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/69), pre-timed and ready for mapping just like every other song on every other Featured Artist listing (which you should use for every map you create). You'll find these new additions highlighted by this **NEW** tag:
