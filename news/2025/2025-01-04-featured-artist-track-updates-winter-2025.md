If your New Year's resolution is to become a mapper, a solid first step would be experimenting with any of the **40** songs we added to our Featured Artist library today!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/featured-artist.jpg)

osu!'s [Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) has over **450** talented musicians at this point. While we usually reserve weekends for new artist announcements, we have a bunch of tracks from older artists to showcase, so... that's what we're doing.

Any new songs are marked with a **NEW** icon on the Featured Artist listing.

Last year, we added two tracks created for a visual novel ([INTERNET OVERDOSE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1687132) and [INTERNET YAMERO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2074198))  to [**Aiobahn**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/166)'s Featured Artist catalogue, and this year we're adding one more **KOTOKO** collaboration to the mix.

Solo metal producer [**Andy Gillion**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/302) has been intently producing music since his reveal as a Featured Artist two years ago, resulting in a debut of his new album *Exilium* at the end of last year. Its opening track *Prophecy* made its way here.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/38/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38)

Considering he's an artist + osu! player who's been here since nearly the beginning, it's no surprise that [**BilliumMoto**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38) would show up again with a small batch of new tunes.
