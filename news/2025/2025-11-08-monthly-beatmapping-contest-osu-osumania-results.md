How did the latest contests pan out? What happens when someone wins the Monthly Beatmapping Contest 6 times? Is osu!mania still breathing? It's time for answers.

We're doing things a bit differently this month.

Usually, the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) would be launching new contests for both **osu!** and **osu!mania** mappers right now. Throughout this month however, there are already ongoing contests for those two game modes, all of which focus on Featured Artist tracks just like the Monthly Beatmapping Contest!

Instead of diverting mapper attention across multiple contests, we think you should devote your mapping minds to these less-frequent contests:

- [Vocaloid Mapping Contest 3 (osu!)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-05-vocaloid-mapping-contest-3) closes submissions on November 10th
- [Fall Time Mania Mapping Contest 2025 (osu!mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-30-fall-time-mania-mapping-contest) closes submissions on November 24th
- [Pending Cup 2025 (osu!)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-24-pending-cup-2025) closes submissions on December 7th

We don't want to hold results from the previous contests hostage longer than they need to be though (specifically [August 2025's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-08-06-monthly-beatmapping-contest-august-2025) for osu!, [June 2025's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-06-13-monthly-beatmapping-contest-june-2025) for osu!mania), so we're splitting up the results and the new contest announcements!

If you're eager to map specifically for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest, come back next month. For now, let's cover the results.

### osu! results

This contest's limitation: **all combos in your map must end in an odd number** *or* **all combos in your map must end in an even number.**

This is a first for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest: two contest veterans have earned titles for their persistent success!

[0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840) has been a legend since the beginning. Their first-ever Monthly Beatmapping Contest submission [over 5 years ago](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-12-14-monthly-beatmapping-contest-10-results) ended up taking 1st place over a sea of experienced mappers. Years later, they hadn't rusted in the slightest, taking runner-up spots in [February 2024's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-05-10-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2024) and [May 2025's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-08-06-monthly-beatmapping-contest-august-2025). Today, [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840) is on top, joining the ranks of osu!'s *Elite Mapper*s.

In recent history, [0ppInOsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12551840)'s biggest rival has been the one and only [fowwo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4547551). With 6 separate podium placements in Monthly Beatmapping Contests since 2020, [fowwo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4547551) has shown determination nearly unmatched in the mapping scene. We've been coy about revealing what happens when someone reaches 2x the *Elite Mapper* contest points threshold, but now everyone knows what it takes to become *Elite Mapper II*.

Unrelated to prize stuff, you might've also noticed that all of the top submissions use odd-numbered combos, despite this contest's limitation allowing even-numbered combos too. Combos with even numbers are harder to consistently coordinate than odd numbers, so we'd like to also shout out [Selithrarion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4613388), [Eterdesp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11436348), [Syodou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11333236), and [Rolniczy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8331132) for creating especially cool maps (according to the [screeners](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening)) limited to even-numbered combos!

Last but absolutely not least, this contest wouldn't be possible without help from our screeners [Shii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9186316), [Uberzolik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1314547), [a bat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13531879), [Coeminals](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10213311), [nuclei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25134566), [mapping](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30730829), [Liyuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10631018), [Andrea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33599), and [table tennis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17592067), along with our judges [Plus4j](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4086497), [Maiev](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10183830), [SUISEI69](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22406733), [Tesla173](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18038026), [Dark Soap](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9945607), [Lylaera](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11652922), [iBell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4298072), and [Ellyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4438154)!

### osu!mania results

This contest's limitation: **submit a 4K map that aims to have the highest star rating possible (while still being playable).**

osu! isn't the only mode to pick up some *Elite Mappers* this time around. While the contest's #1 spot went to [Micleak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16140674), its runner-up [Lott](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13821222) has been gunning for the top prize in MBC for years. They've submitted to the contest since 2020, improved their mapping capabilities enough to start winning at the [end of 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-11-14-monthly-beatmapping-contest-november-2023), and continued having podium placements through to this contest! Welcome [Lott](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13821222) to osu!mania's hall of *Elite Mapper*s.

Despite delays caused by hosting this contest at the same time as [this year's osu!mania 4K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_4K), we still want to give some love to the judges who worked it out in the end: [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), [elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093), [Monoseul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16010604), and [rikan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25263357)!

And... that's it for now! This is where we'd normally put the criteria for this month's MBC, but as mentioned earlier, we're delaying that so you can focus on these other ongoing contests:

- [Vocaloid Mapping Contest 3 (osu!)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-05-vocaloid-mapping-contest-3) closes submissions on November 10th
- [Fall Time Mania Mapping Contest 2025 (osu!mania)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-30-fall-time-mania-mapping-contest) closes submissions on November 24th
- [Pending Cup 2025 (osu!)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-10-24-pending-cup-2025) closes submissions on December 7th

See you next month!
