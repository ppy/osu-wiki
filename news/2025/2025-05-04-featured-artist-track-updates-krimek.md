From a regular in osu!'s [music production scene](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) to one of osu!'s Featured Artists, **Krimek** returns with a new batch of tracks!

When [**Krimek** joined our Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-07-08-new-featured-artist-krimek) two years ago, they had just debuted their first album. Since then, **Krimek** has been knee deep in music production, shooting out two new albums and a ton of single-track releases with vocal features from names throughout the DTM scene! On top of that, **Krimek**'s music has been a spotlight in countless tournaments, so some of these tracks might be *very* familiar!

A grand total of **20** new songs (and their pre-timed `.osz` files) have been added to [**Krimek**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/371). Scout out every track with this **NEW** tag to see what's... uh... new:

If you're waiting for a sign before you start mapping, this is it. More specifically, every **NEW** tag beside songs on [**Krimek**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/371) is your sign. Pick one out and start circle-placing instead of circle-clicking for a change.

Alternatively, you can wait until next weekend to start mapping songs from whichever musician we announce as our newest Featured Artist!

Stay tuned.
