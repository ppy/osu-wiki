With a haunting total of **155** entries, our osu! resident artists have brewed up a cauldron of chilling creativity! Now, it's *your* turn to step into the night and cast your **15** votes to decide which creations will rise from the shadows as rulers of the night!

Need help deciding? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a spooky slideshow showcasing all of the entries set to the tunes of [Igorrr & Ruby My Dear](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/370)'s *Figue Folle*:

As usual, the following selection of prizes will be up for grabs:

- A selection of the top-voted finalists will be **featured on the main menu**.
- Top-voted entries will receive **3 months of osu!supporter**.
- The top 3 will receive bespoke **profile badges** made from their own creations.
- The top 4 will also be featured as [**limited-time default profile banners**](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations), with the ones from last round rotating out.

Many thanks to all participants who've dedicated the time and effort into creating and submitting an entry — without you, we wouldn't be here to begin with!

And to whoever kept the dotted osu! cookie template visible in their submission, we will make sure both sides of your pillow are warm tonight :).

Good luck!
