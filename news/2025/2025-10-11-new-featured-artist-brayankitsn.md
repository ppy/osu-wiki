Artcore is a staple of rhythm game music, and few make it with the same skill as **BrayanKitsn**.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/506/header.jpg)

After discovering tracks like *Feryquitous*'s "Strahv" and *An*'s "Xhroria", **BrayanKitsn** began producing their own brand of emotional electronic music, eventually drawing more influence from artists like *Sakuzyo*, [*Street*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/89), and [*ak+q*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/466).

A grand total of **14** tracks can now be found on [**BrayanKitsn**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/506)!

**BrayanKitsn** is [an osu!mania player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34744443), so it's only appropriate that their music has mostly spread throughout the osu!mania community. Check out some maps:
