As teams begin shifting to their top gears, the tournament's zenith looms ever closer! The last remaining 7K titans clash head-on with bone-chilling performances all across the bracket.

If last week was this tournament's low point, then this week was the complete opposite! Only legends remain, and the chances for any team's success grow slimmer by the day. Those who thought things couldn't get harder from now on, were proven to be sorely mistaken. Only for Finals and Grand Finals to be bound to break the skill ceiling once again to an unimaginable degree.

There have been quite a lot of exciting moments on this week alone. From historical feats achieved by some of the teams, to fun moments shared amongst the pooling team members. Tournaments are meant to be fun after all, both to its participants and organisers!

We even got the chance to interview [-luvv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23731514) on behalf of team Peru given their players' performances throughout the tournament. Definitely a story worth telling from one of this year's most promising teams!

Rambling and spoilers aside, this week's video recap is yet again brought to you by [SurfChu85](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4469895) and [yukina meng](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9919550). A very good alternative to the usual podcasts you may be used to listening in the background on your spare time.

![Semifinals mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2025-02-13-osumania-7k-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap/mappool.jpg)

We've reached a point where the average Joe may struggle to keep up with the mappool's difficulty. If earlier maps are characterised by their need to get very good accuracy on them, higher-end maps are tests of endurance meant to push players to their limits, where difficulty comes from misses more than anything else. And let us tell you — missing our players will!

Keeping up with the same pool size as last week and its newfound categories, we have several new rehashed [bespoke tracks](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) on this round's pool! Most interestingly, the first one is [Trina Lydia - TETRATONE ALTiSSiMO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317891#mania/4964056) (LN3) mapped by [U1d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10125072) and originally released for the [1K Dan Course](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2234936#mania/4747563). That's right, one key! As for returning originals from other World Cups, we have [Lime - Pixel Planet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317895#mania/4964061) (RC6) made by [_Kobii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6209713), [SiLiS - Hebe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317981#mania/4964313) (RC5) by [_Yiiiii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6066359), and finally [aquestion - Umami Blaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6066359) (RC1) mapped by [pwhk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4887865). Quite the assortment of original rice maps.

But originals are not the only highlights of the pool! As we all know by now, the mini-TB gives players a taste of how an actual tiebreaker is typically designed, both in terms of structure and difficulty. [mitei - Phosphor](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317893#mania/4964059) (HB3) by [U1d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10125072) has it all! Aesthetically pleasing patterns are present throughout the map while covering a wide range of skill sets required to play these patterns effectively. Beyond these challenges, it also offered an enjoyable experience not only for the players alone but also for the mappool playtesters. A 0% ban rate during the weekend is a testament to that.

Following suit from last week, we've got a couple new original tracks lined up! The second one to showcase was [FOXGLOVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318030#mania/4964416) (HB1) produced by [Xyris](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/433) with the backup of [Critical_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196) as the maestro behind the map. A fairly generic hybrid as the category would suggest. Not to be confused with simple however given the map's tricky nature. With fast-paced chordstreams to the rhythm of the song's very upbeat melody and less-than-friendlier releases, this beatmap is anything but simple.

Our second and last original track of the week was [Ruin in Cascade](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318032#mania/4964418) by [kanemiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/367). Keeping up with the tradition of featuring exciting new tracks on the tiebreaker, this year's 7K MWC was no exception! A massive collaborative effort between [Critical_star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196), [_Stan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1653229), [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785), [kaulpakka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7115625), [ExNeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7590894), and [taba2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7850508).

But words alone cannot describe the map, so why not enjoy it in full thanks to [cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4477497)'s amazing play with [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323)'s eye-watering storyboard to accompany it with!

## Semifinals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **Indonesia** ::{ flag=ID }:: | **6** | 1 | ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation |
| BIG MAXUS | 6 | **7** | **ET BLOCKO** |
| **Malaysia** ::{ flag=MY }:: | **6** | -1 | ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile |
| United States ::{ flag=US }:: | 2 | **6** | ::{ flag=PE }:: **Peru** |
| **South Korea** ::{ flag=KR }:: | **6** | 4 | ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan |
| **Indonesia** ::{ flag=ID }:: | **6** | 0 | ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia |
| **China** ::{ flag=CN }:: | **6** | 4 | ::{ flag=PH }:: Philippines |
| **Hong Kong** ::{ flag=HK }:: | **6** | 0 | ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany |
| Hong Kong ::{ flag=HK }:: | 2 | **6** | ::{ flag=PE }:: **Peru** |

This week was nothing short of amazing! We reached a point of the tournament where the best of the best teams are being tested against one another. The matches between ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea versus ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan and ::{ flag=CN }:: China versus ::{ flag=PH }:: the Philippines should get the point across, with all four teams being the top 4 seeded teams on this year's Qualifiers!

The last two teams standing in the winners' bracket are ::{ flag=KR }:: South Korea and ::{ flag=CN }:: China, who'll be facing each other in the Finals to see who gets to keep their spot in the Grand Finals. The rest of teams however haven't had it as easily in the losers' bracket given how high the stakes were.

On the other side of the bracket, teams had to win two consecutive matches to keep up with the pace. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia and ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru were able to survive the gauntlet, moving on to the Finals for their very last chance at redemption. A very exciting moment for Indonesian fans, who get to see their country get to the Finals for the first time since all the way back to 2017!

And what other way to begin with the match highlights than by recapping the best of the best show match this series has ever seen. Truly a fight between an unstoppable force against an immovable object!

## Score highlights

This weekend gave us quite an extense highlight reel in spite of the increased difficulty of the mappool. The scores we're about to mention are some of the best performances seen throughout the weekend!

- Elite osu!mania 7K player ::{ flag=KR }:: [dressurf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/758406) gave us a masterclass on playing technical charts with their 991k score on [The Flashbulb - Six Acid Strings](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318102#mania/4964713) (RC4). Not satisfied with that score alone, they doubled down by scoring 986,112 on [mitei - Phosphor](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317893#mania/4964059) (HB3), barely missing out on the full combo.
- Speaking of masterclasses, ::{ flag=JP }:: [butanic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1433586) also offered us one on overall consistency on rice charts thanks to their 993k run on [SiLiS - Hebe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317981#mania/4964313) (RC5).
- ::{ flag=CN }:: [[Crz]Satori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082178)'s lecture on noodle slurping continued with their impressive 987k run on [Elliot Hsu - A Guiding Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317897#mania/4964065) (LN1). If anything, this score should serve as *a guiding star* for us who wish to emulate these players' ability to play the game.
- South Korea's team captain, ::{ flag=KR }:: [yz1155](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2071008), gave us quite an emphatic performance this weekend. Enough for us to highlight three scores at once! Namely, their 988k full combo on [Aiobahn feat. KOTOKO - Gekkouchou (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317886#mania/4964046) (LN4), their 989k 1-miss run on [FOXGLOVE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2318030#mania/4964416) (HB1), and an *enchanting* 986k FC on [linear ring - enchanted love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2317898#mania/4964066) (HB2).
