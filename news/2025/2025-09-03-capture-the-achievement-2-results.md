Back in July, 104 teams gathered for 15 days to solve 101 mind-bending osu! puzzles and quests. 2649 total completions later, we have our winners!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-06-21-capture-the-achievement-2/banner.jpg)

For those first hearing of [Capture The Achievement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-06-21-capture-the-achievement-2): it's a scavenger hunt event built around the idea of [medal](/wiki/Medals) hunting. Teams earn points by completing "achievements" with custom requirements. Many have hidden requirements, similar to [hush-hush](/wiki/Medals#hush-hush) medals.

In a packed two weeks with a nonstop stream of new achievements releasing gradually, teams spent hours everyday on solving puzzles, deciphering achievements, researching, racking their brains, and going a bit crazy.

Let's go back and look at some highlights of [Capture The Achievement 2](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/2).

## Top place finishers

The competition for the top spots was fierce, with 1st place frequently swapping throughout the event. [Check out this timelapse to see how the leaderboard scuffle went down!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=553VEjgSx5k)).

In short, **Pawsome üñêÔ∏è** and **osu!friends** were top contenders fighting for the lead throughout the event, with several other teams including **bc3 ultra** (also briefly holding first place early on), **Magic's Animals**, **EXEC_with.METHOD_METAFALICA/.** and **thought it was a normal tourney** racing to shake up the volatile podium spots.

In the final week, team **thought it was a normal tourney** was creeping up on a sizeable lead by team **osu!friends**. After two long days nearing day 13, they slowly managed to push past them, continuing on with determined and consistent effort to secure the victory while the clock was ticking down its last hours. During those hours, team **osu!friends** ended up finishing in 3rd, with team **Pawsome üñêÔ∏è** coming back to snatch 2nd place *right before the end*!

Congratulations to the top 3 teams! You'll find the full point breakdown of points for the winning teams right below:

### Sound in Motion

|  |  |
| --: | :-- |
| Description | What is a map/chart? To answer that I started to play various maps and charts from diverse games, starting with osu! Standard, osu! Taiko, osu! Mania and osu! Catch, and then I decided that I was too restricted to just play things from osu!, so I decided to venture out and play other things like, Wacca, DDR and SDVX to get an idea of what is important. But after all that, to be honest, I just don't know, they are all so different, each one has more than 6k rules to follow and that doesn't even count what I need to even do things for MWC and similar. But I could notice the passion, so for that I decided to put a bit of my passion in this too, like messing with sliders with some inspiration from mappers like idke, although I need a break. Hope you like it! |

This achievement certainly had the most time and effort put into it, with even a custom map from [TamamoLover](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7772622). It was made to be a quite difficult achievement, so congrats to the 5 teams that completed it! Here's a comment from [-Rinne-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13407431) about the achievement:

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13407431" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-Rinne-.jpg')"></a>

So, Sound in Motion uh? Well, this was by far the longest achievement from concept to execution that I ever made (5 months).

It started back in March when I was working with audio files and had the idea to learn Steganography, this eventually brought the original idea for the achievement when I proposed making one related to it as a "sequel" to Vex. Originally it was supposed to be a pretty simple achievement where you just had to find the numbers in the mp3, with the hints pointing right at it. But that was found to be just too boring and quick, wasting a good idea. The second iteration on the other hand had the intention of adding the slider anchor art or just slider arts with the string of numbers in a single difficulty, but like the last time, the achievement was still missing that extra part to make it perfect, and then it hit me, 12h before release, what if I named every diff "expert" in different languages, quickly realized that I couldn't do anything with that and then it hit me... What about just rhythm game difficulties? And it was perfect.

If I had to say what was the biggest hurdle, it would 100% be the description. As some might know from [CTA1](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/1), there was an achievement that I made called "Butchering a Name" has a writing style very similar, where I like to write a very long description with the hints sprinkled in it. The problem with that is of course the word soup that might be created, and when the first description draft was submitted, [Sheppsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608) clearly saw that as a problem, and after 4 iterations, the final description was reached, even if [Sheppsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608) thought it was a bit too long, I didn't want to budge anymore, feeling that I would be sacrificing my style.

So yeah, that was Sound In Motion, once again thanks to [Sheppsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608) for giving the idea for and making the slider anchors and [TamamoLover](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7772622) for making the map. I promise the next one will be even better.

### The Everlasting Epigrapher

As the creator of this achievement ([Sheppsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608)), I'm certainly biased, but it was definitely my favourite. The idea was initially proposed by [Anonymoose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11153810) to somehow use the cryptic language in [Yooh - Eternity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402789#fruits/5211146) for an achievement ‚Äî this being before the translation was revealed. After finding some free time, I was trying to decipher it with [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) also joining in.

After an hour, we had a table of symbols to letters (except J and Z, which we're pretty sure were not used anywhere). In the process, [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) had translated the text on all 5 rocks. Come a few days later, I finally had a good idea of how we could use this all in an achievement, and thus **The Everlasting Epigrapher** was born. The CWC team absolutely cooked with this tiebreaker and I think it's pretty cool that we were able to use their little easter egg. Like the "Sound In Motion" achievement, this one was also made to be pretty difficult, so well done to the 7 teams that completed it!

### Graphic Design Is My Passion

|  |  |

| Description | Sheppsu's been busy updating the site, so he put me in charge of graphic design. The lineup he gave me looked a bit unfamiliar, but I managed to pull things off with the help of some dark magic. [https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/graphic_2b2d5018fe0cb636.html](https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/graphic_2b2d5018fe0cb636.html) |

[yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) made several puzzle-oriented achievements that were widely loved. It's tough to pick just one to highlight, but this one was among the favourites. Best of all, you can [try it yourself](https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/graphic_2b2d5018fe0cb636.html)! You can [read yandax's write-up on the solution here](https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/solutions_e1529b90acab3664/solutions.html#graphic-design-is-my-passion).

### INSERT COIN

| Description | INSERT COIN |

[Dragon20942](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964) made several achievements with interesting wordplay, and **INSERT COIN** was liked by many. If you liked this one, you should also check out **Perpertually Anxious** and **Ball Load Error** on the [achievements page](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/2/achievements). I'll let [Dragon20942](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964) take it away from here:

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dragon20942.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964">Dragon20942</a></p>

INSERT COIN was really a team effort, and an achievement that was particularly fun for me because of that. Rather than any one of us solo generating a concept, we iterated between different parties in a way that suited our individual strengths. The final idea felt polished and compelling too! The process went something like this:

1. I floated the idea of the mods spelling something - [Daanny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7183087) had also thought of this
2. I asked about a canonical mod order - [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) found it and also generated a list of possible words we could spell out
3. We brainstormed and found a few words/maps to try (like SODA and DANS)
4. I suggested COIN and Insert Coin mapsets
5. [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) playtested the COIN mod combination
6. [Daanny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7183087) and I tuned the final difficulty/polish:
   - Redundant title/description highlights the idea that there are 2 conceptual "COINs" and the repetition evokes the idea of the prompt flashing on an arcade cabinet
   - COIN should be capitalized since it refers to a mod abbreviation
   - INSERT being capitalized helps further underscore the retro/arcade theming while adding some obfuscation for the idea of COIN referring to mods

Thank you to everyone who took a crack at it!

This achievement, while having a simple solution, required some out-of-the-box thinking. It's a pretty cool one for the creativity in its solution. Still, it wasn't challenging enough for some, with the first completion being 6 minutes after release and 23 teams completing it!

### Touhosu!

This is one of the nine competition achievements, which were popular for their replayability. No secrets here, just a pretty cool [Necrofantasia map from Luscent](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1881398#fruits/3873376) where you play Touhou in osu!. There were 6 players able to get down to the lowest score of 1 fruit caught (0 doesn't submit), so well played. Even if you've never played osu!catch before, you'd miss out if you didn't check out this map at least once!

## Solutions and more

While that's all for the highlights, there were some other cool achievements that you can find on the [CTA2 achievements page](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/2/achievements) with the solutions available.

I've very thankful to the staff that helped bring this event to life, because making this many achievements of at least decent quality is no easy task. In addition, [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) and [Alanko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14208558) helped greatly with implementing achievements on the CTA server to reduce bugs and my workload. A full list of staff is available on the [CTA Staff page](https://cta.sheppsu.me/credits).

I plan to host CTA3 next summer and implement the feedback received from this event, so look forward to that!
