## Finalists

No stranger to fierce artistic competition, [**leeian**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12595640) pushed ahead and shocked the crowd with a scene of pippi vs. [Chloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-06-09-corsace-closed#corsace-closed:-the-manga) on the batting field, a cross-over worth the home run and a landslide victory with **918** votes.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/KAITO%20thighs.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/KAITO%20thighs.png)

[**KAITO thighs**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233) (still better known as Dreamxiety) continues a full year of art contest podium finishes. This time, pippi entered the drawing competition with **771** KAITO fans skyrocketing her artwork to 2nd place.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/sardines.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/sardines.png)

[**sardines**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16247587), a.k.a. *-northern-*, finally takes a podium finish with their distinct art style that **747** familiar art contest voters instantly recognised, featuring Yuzu flexing on low seeds in `#mappool-feedback` while Chirou is presumably helping with the osu!taiko customs.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/h3p0.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/h3p0.png)

[**h3p0**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15875092) showed us a sneak peek behind the World Cup scenes with pippi and Mocha casting matches. Their broadcast reached a not too atypical viewership of **722** who certainly noticed the various references dotted around.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/Triantafyllia.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/Triantafyllia.png)

[**Triantafyllia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17084594)'s Alisa also made her shot in the art contest, making sure to remind  **722** potential future entrants not to leave the dotted osu! cookie template visible in the submission.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/LeeNarie.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/LeeNarie.jpg)

[**LeeNarie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2667849) pit pippi against Mocha in a stylish battle of game mode supremacy. **669** fighting game enthusiasts felt this was right up their alley, all jumping in to predict who would win.

LeeNarie, unlike Triantafyllia, did leave a cookie template on the artwork. Whoop-de-doo.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/Kwms024.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/Kwms024.png)

[**Kwms024**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11516014) decided that pippi would become a competitive rock artist this spring, and **615** of you agreed that she would absolutely shred 280 BPM.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/Son%20Goku.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/Son%20Goku.png)

Chirou showed pippi the ropes of *Taiko no Tatsujin* in [**Son Goku**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14991975)'s dim yet cozy arcade, yielding a picture worth **610** impressions from drum admirers.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/SuperSSun.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/SuperSSun.png)

[**SuperSSun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6972778) (with assists from [RedcXca](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601)) managed to create a certifiably relaxing piece of Alisa and pippi engaging in a casual late-night drawing bout over chips, coffee and some likely chill music for Don, some suspiciously familiar friends and **588** of you to hang out with.

While primarily a solo contest, we've agreed for this time that this entry was too good to pass up on.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/ceroux.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/ceroux.png)

[**ceroux**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24183534) sponsored pippi's trip to the osu! World Cup stadium, showing **509** spectators the moment when the best of the best is about to *lock in*.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/1%20zero.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/1%20zero.PNG)

At [**1 zero**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7440794)'s 1v1 setup, it's pippi against Mocha, but on circle clicking turf this time. **494**
tournament viewers tuned in on the commotion, eager chip in with their pick'ems.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/maynare.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/maynare.jpg)

[**maynare**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23930728) invited Mocha to compete in the art contest. It seems the artwork wasn't quite ready for viewing, but the candid picture of an artist in her natural habitat was appreciated by **464** voters.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/1ufu9hfnhf9h.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/1ufu9hfnhf9h.png)

[**1ufu9hfnhf9h**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/26908837), whose name we definitely didn't misspell, made waves among **450**
pixel art enjoyers for the slightly chaotic yet uniquely entrancing art of Mocha at the taiko assembly line. We can only assume this is what new players feel like when they first encounter intricately constructed SV maps.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/mewpt.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/mewpt.png)

[**mewpt**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3078282) took the entire osu! cast to the arcade and showed us all the fun they were up to. The good vibes reached **443**
gamers around the world.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/MeowMiaw.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/MeowMiaw.png)

Mani and Mari were the stars of [**MeowMiaw**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23071617)'s show(down), attracting their friends to witness, once and for all, the one sibling that can dish out better moves on the 10K dance floor.

### peppy's Picks

Clearly 15 votes weren't enough, as [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) stepped in to bless us with some more visual delights.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/Foodmageddon.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/Foodmageddon.png)

[**Foodmageddon**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25005197) organised a culinary competition, where two teams of osu! representatives vie to impress the special guest judge: peppy.

Not only did the username check out on this one, but it also did in fact impress peppy.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/KerbBerb.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/KerbBerb.png)

[**KerbBerb**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35229710) captured the moment when Mocha crashes out of a window to engage Taikona— no, MEGA Taikonator 3000 in a battle of epic proportions.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/Vayntail.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/Vayntail.png)

[**Vayntail**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11667366) introduced Mocha and pippi to the world of drift racing, a world of dim skies and bright spotlights.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/banners/Tokharya.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/242/winners/Tokharya.png)

[**Tokharya**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11390612) went live on the scene to report on pippi's long-awaited LAN tournament run. Many spectators showed up to the match, including her good friend Mocha, Don, and a curious game creator.
