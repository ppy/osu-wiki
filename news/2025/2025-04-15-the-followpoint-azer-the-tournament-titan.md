You hear that? That's the sound of a new interview — this time with renowned player and World Cup organiser, Azer!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-04-15-the-followpoint-azer-the-tournament-titan/banner.jpg)

[Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) is someone you have likely heard of if you are interested in osu! World Cups, and especially if you are an older player. He's contributed a lot to the tournament scene, earning multiple [badges](/wiki/Community/Profile_badge) throughout his time playing. He has also contributed heavily to the osu! World Cups, ranging from pooling to organising the entire thing! Not to mention that he also received a [Community Contributor badge](/wiki/People/Community_Contributors) for his dedicated work!

And now we have a chance to learn more about his path in osu!, so without further ado — let's get to reading!

Hello Azer! For our first question, how would you introduce yourself to someone who doesn't know you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

Hi everyone! My name is Alex, I've played osu! for 13 years and I've streamed my entire journey, from peaking at #10 in 2015 to participating in the tournament scene as a player, host, commentator and mappooler. I've also mapped for just as long and played other modes a little bit at various points in time (3 digit taiko & 4 digit 4k). I was one of the first osu! players to obtain a Twitch partnership and helped pioneer the osu! scene on Twitch.

I've mostly retired from any sort of competitive play, now focusing on organising world cups and helping various tournament projects to offer a great experience for the next generation of players. Within the World Cups, I mostly manage standard mappooling (as pretty much every single role within, but most crucially providing rare player-focused mapping feedback and quality assurance) and osu! Originals (I handle the standard artist lineup each year and help all world cup teams, providing production related feedback in places it is asked for and optimizing our music to fit each gamemode's events).

How did you get introduced to osu! and what was your first impression of it?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

A friend I played Counter Strike with told me the game is great for aim training (classic...), and since I have a heavy music background I picked it up pretty quickly. It felt extremely foreign at first since I had never been introduced to otaku culture prior and was kinda fascinated to learn about so many artists and new music genres I had never heard before. I had played a lot of Guitar Hero but never really got to hear any eastern music or play any other rhythm games, so it was really captivating. Some of the artists I initially discovered here when I was new are still some of my favourites to this day. I wasn't particularly dragged in by watching any gameplay or notable players, but mostly just to the unique experience it provides.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

Is there a specific memory from osu! that stands out to you? If so, which one?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

It's hard to choose one, since I've been in this community for almost half my life now, but if I had to choose one really early on that I remember very fondly, it was my [very first match in OWC 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCaXKs4z5TU). I had only been playing for a year, and our team (Canada) was not particularly high level or expected to win anything. Our first match in the group stage just happened to be against the strongest team in the tournament - Japan.

The match started, and we were literally 8 noobs against the biggest names in the game, including the world's best player, [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352328). We played the first map, just expecting to have fun being there and... somehow won? We won our first pick against the tournament favourites, it was pretty insane at the time. Of course, we proceeded to lose every remaining map as expected, but I'll cherish that moment forever.

That match came with a little extra as well! Unfortunately the video is lost media, but as the match ended, for whatever reason I was given host in the multiplayer room. Everyone else had left... except for rrtyui. If you know this player from this time, you know exactly what he was known for, so of course being gifted this situation I did what needed to be done... I picked [The Big Black](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/41823) and readied up. I wasn't really expecting anything to happen, but the stream kept going, the casters were confused but optimistic, and the best player in the game readied up on his iconic map in a 1v1 against some random Canadian guy he probably never heard of.

So we played, the chat was really happy to see rrtyui play this map live, the casters were having fun with the situation as well, and eventually the map was cut-off and never reached the end. Let it be known that, on this day, I beat rrtyui on The Big Black (he failed the infamous ending before I did, so the map ended... lol).

It was a completely meaningless situation just for fun, but it meant a lot to me at the time and probably was a big reason why I eventually ended up being so involved with competition in the game.

What would you say is the greatest gift that osu! has given you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

The best thing osu! has given me is definitely the sense of community! Being able to join here when it was much smaller and make so many close friends, getting to see it grow into what it is now, the thousands of people I've met that have come and go, for sure. Almost everything in my life somehow links back to this game. Most of my friends on and offline, my career opportunities, etc. It gave me a space to discover a niche talent and do something interesting with my music & gaming interests (both have been a major part of my life since I was 5 years old). It essentially awakened and defined what my passions are, and allowed me to connect with people worldwide who happen to share them too. I really wouldn't trade such a unique experience for anything.

On top of that, my experiences as a player and a personality have given me some sense of purpose and helped me appreciate my affinity for music and games in general. Since an art form like music/musicianship is really hard to assess competitively, it's a lot easier to appreciate "oh I got the best score in the world on this map" as opposed to something like "I can play this crazy piece on my instrument and I'll never know if someone plays it better". It's just nice to know that undoubtedly, you're good at something. Even within the world of rhythm games, osu! has been the only one that fulfills that competitive side for me.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

How do you stay motivated even after a decade of being an active osu! player and a community figure? Did you ever feel like you wanted to quit, and if so, how did you deal with such feelings?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

My motivation mostly lies in my desire to give back and to contribute to what made this place so special to me. I want to preserve it and improve it however I can to ensure new players get to have as good of a time I got to have. When it comes to quitting, I've technically already quit competitive play long ago, but I'm sure I'll always be here to check on things for years to come. When so much of your life has been forged around your experiences and connections here, the saying is true. You are here forever. I think it's easy to stay motivated and find new ways to help people and improve the experience in whatever limited ways I may be able to. It's like decorating my second home. I live here, so it might as well be nice!

What are your thoughts on the "Azer isn't so great?" copypasta?

> Azer isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such aim ability and movement with a tablet? Alex puts the game on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Cookiezi breaks records. Rafis breaks records. Azer breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

I know people love this and despite hearing this stupid line thousands of times (yes I still regularly run into random people typing this to me, even in other games LOL), I do find it funny and endearing that it apparently made such a big wave that there are legitimately new players who only know me as "the guy from the meme" and it's really funny to think about.

Honestly it's been so long that I don't quite remember who made it exactly, but to have a random inside joke from my community explode like this has wasn't something I could ever predict... it's literally just another copypasta, how did we get here?? (It's not even original either, it's adapted from Alex19 in the smash scene, just a PSA)

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

What made you get into casting tournaments? Was there anything/anyone specific that motivated you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

When I started casting, commentary was a lot less polished, so it was easy as a knowledgeable player to step in and talk about stuff, but over time certain casters came along and really made everyone else step up their game. I don't particularly consider myself a great caster but my depth of experience still lets me bring interesting topics, and that type of casting is kinda hard to come by (most casters had great voices/pacing but not many really had high level player experience, so I slotted in the ecosystem easily)

Most of my motivation to improve came from a few casters who were really good at areas I was lacking, mostly being coherent and being able to direct conversation, some names like [emanfman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4136150), [Dohland](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5220511), [Bae-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6576972), and eventually [D I O](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619) and [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9501251) would come up over time as voices that really impressed me and always felt comfortable to commentate with. I really think that within the osu! standard tournament scene, the level of casting we have is so incredibly elevated by great talent like those mentioned, and when comparing to any events recorded prior to those people improving the scene, it really shines a big spotlight at how proud we can be at the sheer amount of top tier casting talent we have in our community!

What does the osu! World Cup sound team do?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

It's not really an official team to be fair, I just like the name because it represents the small team we have in place to create osu! originals and help them flourish. For the most part it's just [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) and myself, but lately we have also benefited from the help of [Kry.exe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/448), who is one of very few people who hold all the criteria required to contribute to what we do. We essentially provide production feedback to artists we work with in order to create memorable experiences for world cup events. It can be music related, or suitability to gamemode or intent, it can be fixes intended for gameplay etc.

I can give an example using a release from last OWC, [Ajitama Adventure OST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274953#osu/4847546). When we knew Umeboshi Chazuke was interested, I conceptually proposed a song that explores the idea of a musical story, with proper progression, no words just through music alone. They are an artist that are particularly proficient at that kind of thing, and using chiptune style really helps to sell the idea that this little thing is just some video game story being shown in 5 minutes. Throughout the production, at one point the pooling team felt like a few sections needed key changes for gameplay purposes. As someone who shares knowledge of both "languages", I translated those proposed changes from game terms (ie streams, triples, ¼, etc) into music terminology that a producer will be able to understand. In essence, every step of that situation sums up what we do.

It's extremely difficult to find people who are knowledgeable in music production, composition, rhythm games, and more things that are harder to define like the vision to make interesting reveals/events, and the ability to translate between game terminology and music terminology etc. I think you need to be familiar in every single area involved to fully be able to conceive memorable projects that suit osu! as well as our recent originals have. I've always struggled to find more people for this role and I'm very thankful to have another person with me to be able to improve all of our projects! If someone reading this feels like they may be fit and interested in helping, feel free to reach out!

As a World Cup organiser, would you want to give some advice to people who want to host their own tournament for the first time?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

I think when it comes to staffing roles like that, the most important thing is just to get your foot in the door. The tournament community is really just a big web of volunteers who made the effort to participate, so just making things happen and leaving a positive experience with others goes a long way. Similarly, being player unfriendly or taking actions that go against the grain always tends to leave a lasting mark, so it's important to remember that we are just here to have a good time and to promote environments players want to participate in.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/MegaMix.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18152711">MegaMix</a></p>

From your perspective, how would you describe the state of the tournament scene? Anything that you think can be improved, or everything seems fine?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

I think we are due for some more high profile events again! It feels like there aren't really that many, but I think an important thing to figure out right now is how to make open rank tournaments exciting again. I think people tend to avoid them due to superteams spoiling the experience a bit, so I'm excited to see if a solution to that gets implemented anywhere so we don't have to wait months between big events. Non S-tier events seem to be doing fine, but there isn't much outside of OWC to get really excited over. I think the scene might be due for another big shake up, which is why we're trying a lot of experimental things with [Lazer Grand Arena](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA/2024), perhaps something there ends up sticking. There's a lot of very high quality events with very little excitement, relative to the quality they present. I don't really know the solution to any of that, but I think it's definitely the biggest ongoing issue with the tournament scene.

It's pretty hard to pick one after playing for this long, but I can cut it down to 3 that mean a lot to me!

**OWC 2015 vs Taiwan: United Tiebreaker**

In the quarterfinals, we had [a really close match](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/20423117) going up against Taiwan, when legendary players like [hvick225](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/50265) and [Rucker](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/147515) were pretty much playing at their peak. As it progressed, it became clear that it was gonna go to tiebreaker, and people were really excited, knowing that the tiebreaker was United. This being the same year as that score was set, it was extremely nerve wracking seeing that everyone was obviously looking at me to perform. I remember I was so locked in for this, I literally took the few minutes I had to prepare to meditate… It ended up being worth it and I was able to compose myself just enough to FC it to win the match.

</div>

**OWC 2017 vs Germany: Oriental Blossom**

During this year of OWC, I was really making a name for myself being one of the most prominent players of tech/gimmick picks. The week prior, I [SS'd sewing machine](https://youtu.be/Y7DsOtMKfaI?si=z8uV1yWkSg1iseW0&t=3931) against Austria and proved that these types of maps were really dangerous to play against us. A week later, it was picked against germany and despite that team being astronomically favored to win against us (this is the only map we won lol), it felt great to do it again and showing that it wasn't a fluke the first time!

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pll8GQvpUUk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

**OWC 2018 vs Australia: First pick strategy**

This one requires some context, but I felt like I had to include this moment as a captain rather than as a player. We had a really tough matchup against team Australia, who this year (and ever since) was arguably the strongest speed/DT roster of the entire tournament. We knew for SURE that they would win the 2 remaining picks of that type we could not ban out, so instead of letting that happen, I came up with the idea of grabbing the first pick and preying on tournament nerves being at their highest on match start. This was 100% lost in normal conditions and everyone in my team knew this. We essentially stole one of their best picks and forced them to play it at the worst possible conditions, while the rest of our team just had fun **assuming that the pick would be lost**. As it turns out, when you play with no nerves with the expectation of losing, you end up playing pretty well, so we somehow won that pick due to this strategy. It was extremely crucial in the match and took us to tiebreaker, which we also ended up winning. This is definitely still the best tournament strategy I came up with to this day!

(This video has corrupt audio near the end of the first map, sorry!)

[Did we kick a kid?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/200) :tf:

You know, I don't think this part of the meme comes from me or my community, I could be wrong but I really don't remember any presence associated with it. I think it came later from someone else getting a play on it or the other mapset, maybe. I don't really mind it, though, since people mostly link it to the song. Funny story, I made friends with a new player somewhat recently and they were curious about the history of the game and various figures within it, so eventually they asked who I was, and the answer they got from their friend was simply that "I kick kids". No other context was ever given. This is my legacy, I guess..?

If you never played osu!, what game(s) would you mainly play?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Azer.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-gmt" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578">Azer</a></p>

Before osu!, I played a lot of shooter and MMO games, and was already doing content creation for several years already, so I'm sure I would've kept going in that direction. I played a lot of Call of Duty and Counter Strike, and I got really hooked on Overwatch when it initially released (I was semi pro for a year or two) so I think that would have been the most likely!

Honestly this list is filled with tons of European players I never got to meet. I've been to most parts of NA and met a few Japanese players, but never got to go to [COE](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event) or anything so I'd love to hang out with some other long time players from there, probably [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050) and [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286).

If osu! ever introduced a new, 5th game mode, what do you think it should be? What's your vision on what could potentially be made into said game mode?

Considering that all the osu! modes take inspiration from other existing games, I feel like they all cover most of what's possible on PC hardware, so it's hard to say. If there's one thing that might be possible, it could be more of a visually focused experience like Geometry Dash or Groove Coaster, maybe? Outside of that, I think that most other interesting experiences require specific inputs that aren't really possible or intuitive on mouse/keyboard, so I doubt they would ever be attempted.

Do you still have some goal in osu! you'd like to achieve?

Honestly if there's one thing left for me to try one day, it would be to make a complete package by myself. I've already achieved everything I wanted in solo, in tournaments, as a mapper and lately as a creative with how well structured our original releases are and the sheer quality that we're able to consistently output. I love being able to have these tournament releases and see everyone's reaction and excitement! It's really nice to be able to look at something like that and say, we made that. It's hard to quantify this but I also feel like I've met my goal of improving the scene in any area I can, so I've mostly achieved everything I set my eyes on. One thing remains, but considering my knowledge of music production, I'd like to create a proper magnum opus project, mapping my own music. It almost happened a few times already, but I still feel that I have more to learn in both categories to be able to really be proud of it and to match my standards of quality.

And as a last question, do you have anything else that you'd like to mention?

One big personal reason for why I still spend so much time within this community is that I really want to make it the best it can be, to leave a positive influence for how much time I've spent here and how many people I got to interact with. I think it's important for everyone to understand that a lot of the core foundation pillars under us rely on the goodwill of people with similar values, so I find it crucial to make sure those people find their time worthwhile. Be nice and respectful to everyone, and the experience you live here will give back.

A game like this has the tendency to give a big spotlight on people in very formative periods of their lives, and often they might not understand the amount of influence they may spontaneously have, so I feel the need to say these things as someone who experienced that and took a bit too long to understand how to handle it. osu! isn't a mega corporation filled with shareholders and all, it's built on passionate people like you and me, just here to make interesting things happen. Let's make sure we do our best to keep those people motivated. Thank you for reading!
