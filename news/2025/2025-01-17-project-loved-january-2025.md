Happy Project Loved New Year!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Welcome to the first Project Loved news post of 2025! Perhaps your resolution this year is to find out more about what we do? Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes. Each beatmap banner in this news post will redirect you to the respective poll. Alternatively you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote! More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

Speaking of, did you know you can contribute to Project Loved too? The osu! community (you guys!) can submit maps for consideration on our [website](https://loved.sh/), be sure to check it out if you know a map deserving of some signature pink!

Our first *Popular Playcounts* pick for this month goes hard. Presenting [SHADOWRAZE - SHOWDOWN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1711618#osu), mapped by [Mulciber](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8062785), [add222](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14261013), [Jaxyk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11457152), and [mrforse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11642599). With a whopping 1,300,000 play count, this beatmap knows how to stand out — its stylish storyboard complements the simple (but effective!) mapping, making it an accessible experience for players of all skill levels. If you're interested in the top difficulty, get ready for a fun time with the 230 BPM jumps that are quite literally all over the place. And that's not to mention the banging soundtrack for this map — if you're in need of some Russian phonk, here it is in all its pure glory.

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The second *Popular Playcount* for this month is [-NeBu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4099626)'s set of [Modern Talking - Last Exit To Brooklyn](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1289690#osu), featuring [sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698)'s guest difficulty.

The sequel to [Modern Talking - Win The Race](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/929464#osu/1941208) is here.

This set includes two difficulties from two of the most renowned aim mappers in the game. A **8.20★** difficulty from [sytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4175698), and a **9.12★** difficulty from the mapset host, [-NeBu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4099626). You might have seen [mrekk absolutely destroy sytho's diff with DT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZxgGOiyalw), putting up a mind-boggling 3,000 pp for an FC score. -NeBu-'s diff is exactly what you'd expect from their previous Loved maps — demon 9★ aim for the absolute best aim players this game has to offer. And, as always, -NeBu- delivers a banger to accompany these maps.

With a 150,000+ play count and 200+ favourites, this set undoubtedly deserves a place in Project Loved. If you want this map to earn a leaderboard, it's up to you — be sure to cast your vote!

Featuring a joint collaboration among Malaysia's finest talents in mapping, song creation, and graphic design, this map represents the pinnacle of the tournament's history, culminating in a seven-minute heartfelt love letter to the Malaysian community.

On the super server known as OCE, this player queued and queued, yet alas, in the wee hours of the morning, he was autofilled... into the top lane. For a support one-trick, this was a scary place, with those who will abuse your every movement for an advantage, so he played it safe, and blind-picked Malphite. Surely the counter wouldn't be that bad... right?

Olaf, The Berserker, was picked, [pewdekz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5754859) went 0/20 in lane, and started a loss streak that will be heralded in the history books.

This map embodies that moment, that **strength**, of Olaf, The Berserker.

Here's our second *Wildcard* pick for the month... and the legendary mapper [elchxyrlia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1722835), previously known as lahphnya, needs no introduction, really. One of the absolute mainstays of the Loved section, they're back, and with another banger.

If you've played other Arles maps, you should know what to expect — jumps. Lots of them. Beautifully crafted jumps, that feel extremely satisfying to play, on one of BABYMETAL's best songs. It comes as no surprise that the beatmap, while fairly obscure, has pretty much a cult following from those who have seen it in action. So, what are you waiting for? Give this one a try!

Hi everyone! We've taken your `#mappool-feedback` from last week's Project Loved *Wildcard* mappool. Seems that there were too many "streams" (whatever *that* means), so we'll have to do some skill set balancing by throwing in something else this week. Not aim... not alt either...

Straight from the [Charlie's Perfect Math Class](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1570901) lecture, [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812)'s [ALEPH - Delirium](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1799349#osu/3688631) stands to redefine the control tech genre. Extreme 170 BPM snap wiggles into crazy flow-tech sections will require your versatility and determination as a student to pass this class. Try your best to stay afloat and before you consider dropping out, maybe take a look at [some solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GBO109IhDE) first.

If you want to see more maps like this, make sure to let me know in the `#mappool-crashout` channel or on the forums. Thanks for the feedback! :steamhappy:

It's been quite some time since we last nominated a ''Various Artists'' mapset in Loved, so to start off this year, we're bringing you a set that will totally not make you hate yourself at all™.

[Neverending streams for those who hate themselves.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/911459#taiko/2088128) by [Krekker](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8265940) & co., is a set that, as the name implies, is full of streams. Like, a LOT of them. Each difficulty is a different track (Touhou-related, of course), with their own quirks and challenges to overcome, whether they come from the increasing BPM across the spread, or pattern difficulty.

While it certainly is concerning for a map with such a title to amass that impressive play count (here at Project Loved, we love you nonetheless!), it just comes to show the appeal and replay value this set has. The final decision comes to you, the player, so give the set a try if you haven't. Now, if you will excuse us, we have to find a way to fight the Project Hate allegations (we are never beating them).

Having created a number of unique maps, [layxa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14800030)'s interpretation of [Feryquitous - Central Nucleus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1534772#taiko/4927673) is one of their most challenging and has been a favorite of high-level players.

With an SR of 10.12 stars, it is among the highest for osu!taiko maps with leaderboards! It is a 6-minute tech map featuring 1/16 doubles at 175 BPM, and the last kiai requires high ability to hit the notes accurately.

This is a great map to see how skilled you are and to assist you in improving your skills. The difficulty level is also very high with few rest moments, so it isn't easy to catch your breath. Playing at such a high skill level also includes a mental challenge.

Can you pass this map for the best experience ever? Vote and take the challenge!! <3

This month, [Ozu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/980092) is making their first appearance in Loved (sort of)! Despite being a well-liked mapper in the graveyard mapping community and having a few Loved guest difficulties, Ozu has never had one of their own maps appear in the Loved voting. This month, we're changing that!

Bringing his compatriot [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349) along to one of their most successful and best-received maps was not a mistake. [Magical Girl Tour 2019](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1146391#taiko/2393655) offers an amazing 3-minute breakcore journey for more experienced players. You may know Ozu from his YAZD series, and this map is no different. Featuring very challenging 1/6 bursts and complicated doubles at a high BPM, this map is no easy task.

Are you ready to conquer this breakcore demon? Make sure to check out *Magical Girl Tour 2019* now!

If you can't get enough of the technical challenges this map brings, I highly suggest trying out Ozu's maps from their YAZD series aswell!

NomaNomaYeah is a 190 BPM stream stamina map filled with frequent 10-to-30-note streams throughout the map, and streams in the kiai exceeding 100 notes in a row!

Due to the comfortable and varying lengths of patterns, there's not being much room for resting. With the BPM being comparatively lower than a typical stamina map, NomaNomaYeah is a great starting point or practice for those looking to learn streams and build their stamina! It is also great fun for those who have already mastered these skill sets, due to KawaiiBass' satisfying patterning used throughout the map.

Whether you are looking to learn streams, for another map to conquer, or a less speedy stream/stamina map, make sure to give NomaNomaYeah a go!

This map features patterns that can be approached in 2 different ways: you can go the noob route of walking all of the patterns (like the map was intended to be played), or you can go the chad way of tapping every pattern.

[MULA (Sped Up & Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2161360#mania/4557933) is an extremely difficult SV chart, rightfully having its place in the [Grand Finals mappool of the 2023 osu!mania 4K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K#grand-finals). Created by both [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479) and [ERA arccat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4848294), [MULA (Sped Up & Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2161360#mania/4557933) offers a lot of challenges that could easily trip up any player.

At the very start, it instantly hits you with moments where the chart suddenly stops, giving you ample time to process the correct timing for the LN and the long jack. This chart contains a very common theme, wherein you'll have to time two other kinds of notes at the same time, while trying to keep your consistency in check.

Not to mention, the amount of teleports and stops in general should already concern you, especially if you haven't studied this chart yet. As time passes in this chart, more and more complexities are added to the SVs. At the very end, it starts to become a bit more unreadable, and you may not be able to see what the patterning is due to how fast everything is starting to become.

Coming into this chart without prior practice will really send you into trouble. Luckily, there is a [version of this chart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2161360#mania/4557932) that does not contain the SV, which could hopefully help you in dissecting how the patterns in each section work.

The charters have done such an amazing job in being able to express and integrate SV difficulty into a song like this. If you want to see more of these kinds of charts in the Loved section, don't be afraid to give a "Yes" vote and show your support!

After over a year of waiting, we finally see a new [CrewK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11488604) map going up for Loved, and this time it is the fan favorite (and my personal favorite CrewK map) [KAERU - YONEDA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1666553#mania/3463278). This map has been used in many tourneys in the past such as [JMC 4K 2021](https://www.youtube.com/@japanesemaniachampionship4842/) and probably most famously in [4DMWC 4](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/4).

Alongside just being a banger to listen to, this map is just a 4-minute gauntlet of jumpstream stamina at 230 BPM. The most notable patterning is the abundance of anchors present to throw off your balance because players have to juggle between every column through the map. On top of this, players are only given one break to regain stamina. However, the break is towards the end of the map, so it still is very important to be able to stay consistent to not fail on any section.

If you are as passionate about this map as I am, if you just love CrewK maps, or if you have any reason at all, be sure to vote "Yes" in the polls so we can give this map the glory it deserves. Also shoutout Paturages's "boyfriend".

A newcomer arrives to the Project Loved scene! [\[Szy\]MongolCJ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2486125)'s [PAM!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1684822#mania/3442426) can certainly provide you with quite the experience when it comes to practicing and training your chordjack fundamentals and physicality at the same time.

While the start of the chart seems to be very friendly, it immediately starts to pick up the pace by adding some jacks and quads here and there, which eventually builds up to an extremely dense chordjack section. Looking at all of these transitions that you'll have to make between the different hands and quads that are present can be overwhelming, especially if you aren't adept at very dense chordjack patterning.

Oh, and did I forget to mention the small number of breaks that this chart has? This chart is extremely brutal when it comes to reading the different jumps, chords, hands and quads. At the same time, it is a hard test of your stamina when it comes to chordjacks.

Of course, if you think 1.0x isn't hard enough, we have rates up to 1.4x! With a higher BPM, you can really push the limits of how fast you can read these chordjacks while also showing off your stamina capabilities.

Having a newcomer into Project Loved is always so great to see, and I can't wait to see what more charts \[Szy\]MongolCJ can dish out. If you are excited to see more of these charts, then don't be afraid to vote "Yes" and to show your support!

[Wh1teh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2640467)'s charts are always a classic, especially if you've been in the 4K scene for quite a long time. This pack aims to preserve those memories, as we reminisce about the numerous charts we've played with others in different multiplayer lobbies.

To start things off, [Wh1teh Pack #2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/475373#mania/1015662) offers a wide variety of charts that can help you improve as a player, whether you are a newcomer or a veteran in the 4K VSRG scene. Jacks, dumpstreams, and jumpstreams are some of the essential patterns you'll eventually need to master to be flexible and adept at many charts in the game.

Great examples include [XQCL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/475373#mania/1015660), a great file for training your stamina, reading, and consistency; [The Creator](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/475373#mania/1015666), for training your jacks and consistency; and [Dirt on Me](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/475373#mania/1015662), for training dumpstream and speed. Honestly, there's so much more to this pack than these three charts; however, it's best for you to discover all the surprises and great techniques you can learn from the charts here.

Can you believe this pack was uploaded to the osu! website almost ***nine*** years ago? Do you want to relive a piece of history? Or do you want to hone your skills and enhance your 4K ability? If you agree with any of these, don't hesitate to show your support by voting "Yes" on this chart!

[\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750) needs no introduction: a longstanding veteran of not only the osu!mania community, but the rhythm game community at large. This is going to be their 9th Loved nomination.

[Der Wald](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1319005#mania) is a strange creature, even in the world of long notes. I am not good at LN releases and this map is an absolute nightmare to get good accuracy on. I don't know how to approach it. The coordination required to nail the wildly interpretative releases is really challenging at this low BPM. Did you know that LN coordination gets harder the lower the BPM is?

A majority of LN maps opt for ODs between 7 and 8. The OD of *Der Wald* stands at a whopping 8.5. Good luck fighting for the leaderboard on this one.

Does this challenge sound appealing to you? Do you want to improve at LN accuracy by throwing yourself against a wall of 200s? Go ahead and vote now!

This time around, you're getting a genuinely reasonable chart, in comparison to... whatever [*that*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1551974#mania/4388484) was. That aside, we're seeing [DORNWALD \~Junge\~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1660098#mania/3391262) go up this month!

You may already be familiar with stupud man's general style, as he's made a fair amount of density charts in the past. This, however, is definitely the most notable when it comes to what is truly next in line that's deserving of a nomination. Used back in [MWC 4K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K), it was, to no surprise, a density pick in the Round of 16 mappool, used on 1.1x. A big factor in the number behind the chart's popularity rise is the fact that a separate upload was used, meaning that the play count you see on the current set isn't as high as it should be. If you had any doubts about the popularity, you can rest assured knowing that the numbers on this chart are likely even bigger than they seem.

As said earlier, if you're familiar with his density charts, this is no exception. The chart has a very heavy use of 1/4 notes, which ends up giving it a bit of a release-oriented aspect in certain sections, leading it to be a rather unique experience. The BPM being on the lower side makes up for the worry that one might drop their accuracy too much, but of course, there are uprates for the more experienced.

Enough of my talking. Go vote.

At the dawn of 2025, [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) returns to the Loved scene with [Endorfin - Four Leaves](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/901870#mania/2431808).

As many 7K players already know, [ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) is very popular for their unique mapping style, be it in the Loved scene or the Ranked section. This map was nominated because of the streams using LNs in conjunction with vocals, and because its dump expressions are great to play and practice on for more experienced players. We think the quality of the patterns is also high, starting with LN holds in the beginning and getting denser towards the end to match the rising tension.

We also hope you enjoy the charts in 4K, 5K and 6K! Please don't forget to vote yes and support this map!

To start the brand-new year of 2025, we decided to pick [Hana no Tou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1923500#mania/3970789), which is a collaboration effort by [Lung_P](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271308) and [emO_Oticon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12064488) for one of the long note picks!

This map is what you'd expect from the different variants of long notes that test a lot of different skillsets.

The map starts with an LN dense section that is blended with tricky releases that require precise tapping to get decent accuracy, followed by a plentiful amount of LN shields and inverse patterns that compound the amount of density and coordination needed to hit them accurately. If you don't have the necessary experience and versatility to hit such specific patterning, you will find that your accuracy drops quickly.

Both Lung_P and emO_Oticon are incredibly talented mappers with plenty of years of experience charting O2Jam-style charts, and we think that they are more than deserving to have their creation enter the Loved section! Please support the map and the charters by casting a positive vote on this map!
