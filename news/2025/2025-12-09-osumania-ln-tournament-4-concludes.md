After finally overcoming his previous finalist run, ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) not only took home the awe-inspiring 1st seed for every qualifier map, but eventually rose above all competition to take home the Champion title for osu!mania LN Tournament 4, only dropping a total of 4 maps in Grand Finals for his run through the entire bracket.

::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) and ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805), the two LN powerhouses for Thailand in [MWC 4K](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC#osu!mania-4k-world-cup), took home the equally spectacular positions of second and third place respectively, beating out even the most respectable of tournament veterans in o!mLN4.

## Match highlights

There was no shortage of exciting matches. Let's recap some of them:

### 3rd-place match: ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) vs. ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805)

</div>

The Grand Finals weekend opened up with the 2 Thai LN powerhouses, ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) and ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805), going up against each other in a revenge game since their spar in the Quarterfinals.

The match began with both players opting for safer options within the pool, competing on what you could call the last real consistency battles on this pool. The match opened with ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267)'s selection, [Code Name: Sierra (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455623#mania/5366692) (DE1). As one of the easier maps, the back and forth between both players trading misses with each other amounted to a small but significant 364 points to ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267). This was determined by literally a miss in the last 20 notes!

This set the first point to a 5-point streak, where ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) took convincing leads by steering clear of misses and leveraging his consistency level, including a pick on the notoriously difficult chart of the pool, [Dead Aire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455636#mania/5366710) (TE4).

However, ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) showed up with a few tricks up his sleeve. Utilising his protects and performing well at a vital time, ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) managed to dominate by 23,745 points on [See you soon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455632#mania/5366705) (CO1) and won another point by a 7,127 score difference on [TIMING HELL \~The Perpetual Chaotically Unsynced Pendulum\~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455661#mania/5366777) (CO3) with a lucky full combo.

Despite the 2 points, it seemed that ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805)'s physical cap had caught up to him. He eventually conceded 2 points to ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) by score differences of 6,085 and 10,191 on [Lemming Ming (kemu Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2040875#mania/4257678) (TE2) and [Oxalis (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455631#mania/5366703) (DE2) respectively, clinching 3rd place in the tournament and allowing ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) to face ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) one more time in the championship.

### Championship match: ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) vs. ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267)

</div>

The championship match between ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) and ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) can be considered one of the most significant matches to ever happen in osu!mania history, only felt in the intense back and forth between both players on a high-difficulty mappool and stage that is otherwise unfathomable.

The match actually began with ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) taking 3 consecutive points off from ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610), which were, to our shock, ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610)'s first 3 points lost in the entire tournament (save for qualifiers):

- [TEENAGE CITY RIOT (feat. R-Shitei)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2454563#mania/5363657) (WC2) - 5,603 points to ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267)
- [Oxalis (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455631#mania/5366703) (DE2) - 2,225 points to ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267)
- [Hello (BPM) 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455598#mania/5366645) (WC1) - 955 points to ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267)

These serve as living proof that even players who have achieved close to a "godlike" status can bleed. The beginning of the match highlighted ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610)'s internal strife to play to his best potential, and for ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) to physically keep up, hoping to survive 'till the bracket reset using a full-combo approach.

In the race to the championship, both players achieved impossibly difficult feats and ended up in tight scorelines while fighting for points:

- 986,506 points by ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) on [TIMING HELL \~The Perpetual Chaotically Unsynced Pendulum\~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455661#mania/5366777) (CO3), despite 2 misses
- 992,634 points by ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) on [Code Name: Sierra (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455623#mania/5366692) (DE1), with an impressive 10,688x full combo showcasing absolute consistency
- 981,558 points by ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) on [Blossom of Ashes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455603#mania/5366651) (WC3), having 5 200s which is lower than the miss count
- A devastatingly small score difference of 905 points on [Abendstern](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455617#mania/5366679) (DE4) towards ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) after a tense moment of flickering score differences to the last second, allowing the tide of the match to turn towards the American.

As the match progressed into a best of 5, ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) threw a spanner in the works by switching contexts into a high accuracy competition on the low-density pick [See you soon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2455632#mania/5366705) (CO1), which he managed to emerge victorious with a convincing 5,360 point difference.

With the late-game fatigue bearing down on both players, it came down to a final battle of who had the mental and physical stamina to close out the match. Despite the out-of-left-field pick, [Lemming Ming (kemu Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2040875#mania/4257678) (TE2) from ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267), a high amount of misses caused the point to go towards ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610), with a score difference of 23,481.

The last pick of the match, [Minerva](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2044392#mania/4266970) (TE3), was an extremely risky move by ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610), but nevertheless a necessity with the threat of the remaining easier picks potentially allowing ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) to win by consistency. Insanely enough, ::{ flag=TH }:: [--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267) ran ahead of ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) by 10,000 points in the first half, before losing the lead entirely to a huge combo break at the midpoint of the map. The 2nd half was nerve-wrackingly close as they were forced to perform on a highly technical minijack section, which eventually ended up with a 7,178 score difference to ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610), winning him the match and the tournament.

## Honourable mentions

### Finals: ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) vs. ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733)

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaXx-jUi8dk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

In o!mLN4, anything can happen. To those who know ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733), this might've been one of the greatest upsets in 1v1 osu!mania history, pulled off by none other than our 3rd-place winner ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805).

Starting off with the first 3 picks, [Afflict](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452328#mania/5357478) (WC3), [reach for your victory!!!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452334#mania/5357486) (DE2) and [Setsuna Trip](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452371#mania/5357594) (CO3), ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) set an important precedent for the match by winning all three picks with 6,671, 2,314 and 12,454 points respectively, getting a 3-point jump start against ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733).

With ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) entering a precarious state in the match, he acted by picking the most straightforward density map, [White Peak](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1803724#mania/3717642) (DE3). After 3 minutes of tightrope walking on the smallest accuracy difference, ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) emerged victorious with a 1,023 score difference, getting a crucial point on the board and proving his physicality and consistency on the mappool.

Following this break in momentum, ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) went right back into the fray, pulling off surprisingly high scores even on the trickiest maps:

- 992,217 on [Variations on Transcendence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452324#mania/5357451) (WC1)
- 988,473 on [Inutilia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2175016#mania/5341643) (TE1)
- 985,176 on [Kislorod](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452314#mania/5357437) (TE3), with only a single sliderbreak on a technical map focusing on shield control

With a final valiant attempt to overcome the huge scoreline debt, ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) risked the pick on arguably the most difficult map of the pool, [Somniomancer [null set]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452340#mania/5357496) (TE2), and after a monumental collapse from ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805), ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) scored 983,430 on the map and won the pick by a whopping 45,222 score difference. Not wanting to lose to the competition entirely, ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733) additionally picked up an additional point against ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) after fiercely trading misses and ending up with a 4,270 score lead on [Breach](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452341#mania/5357499) (TE4).

With ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733)'s usual habit of catching up in the 2nd half of the match, the turning of the tables felt imminent. However, ::{ flag=TH }:: [konkawe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15665805) managed to gather the match point on ::{ flag=CL }:: [myucchii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10072733)'s pick, [Last Journey (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2452231#mania/5357229) (WC2), scoring 991,088 with a full combo, securing their position in the stars as the top 3 of o!mLN4.

### Semifinals: ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314)

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThhTCJ65hWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

This losers' bracket Semifinals match might be one of the most interesting in terms of dynamics, where both players brought to the table a clash between physicality versus consistency, and had a fight to the death for it.

Both players began with a rough start having barely practised the pool, with ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314) initially taking the lead on [19ZZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2226646#mania/4723502) (TE1) with a score difference of 6,513 and ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) instantly taking back the break point on [Veauty and Violence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2080079#mania/4355866) (WC4) with a score difference of 8,197.

Eventually, ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314) attempted to regain the lead from ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832), all while both players fought and achieved consistent and stellar performances, resulting in a score of 2–5 in favour of ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314):

- ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314) achieved 992,284 points on [Dreamin' attraction!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2006864#mania/4174291) (DE2), showcasing his ability in accuracy and consistency at a high level of LN gameplay
- This was followed by ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314)'s shocking 995,602 score with only 2 200s
- ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) proved he is still in the game with 985,584 on the burst-oriented pick [......Has Arrived.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2407523#mania/5333624) (WC2)
- Despite that, ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314) won the next 2 picks, [Heat abnormal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137913#mania/4499328) (WC1) and [Tada, Kimi no Mama de](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2448990#mania/5347389) (TE2) with a score difference of 2,195 points and 2,706 points respectively

Realising his precarious state, ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) put his foot on the gas pedal, resolving to bring the match to tiebreaker by winning 3 picks in a row:

- ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) won a break point from [Endroll](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2448996#mania/5347411) (DE1) with a clean score of 993,675 and a solid score difference of 8,311
- ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) won on his own pick, [Beast (Vorso Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2230642#mania/4733962) (TE3), and got another break point on [Crimsonate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2449024#mania/5347461) (WC3) with dominant score differences of 9,470 and 11,910 respectively, bringing the match to the tiebreaker

As our original song, [of the Iridescent Judgement](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2449007#mania/5347431) (TB), was played, the players were in for a brutal gauntlet of every skill set tested in the round. Towards the first half, ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314) had the first blood for a miss, but had an accuracy so good he continued to tail behind ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) with approximately a 1,700 score difference. It was not until 3 minutes into the song, that ::{ flag=PH }:: [Plana_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24776314) started to lose control over the more technical aspects of the tiebreaker, giving a large lead of 5,684 to ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832) at the end of the map, closing out the game with a 6–5 reverse from ::{ flag=GB }:: [spanner dude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12489832).

[--Pavin--](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267), a current member of Team Thailand in [4KMWC 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2025_4K) and part of the winning team in [Touhou Project Mania Cup 4th (THMC4)](/wiki/Tournaments/TMC/4th), proved himself as one of the best tournament LN players to exist in this current time, clinching the formidable placement of 2nd place for o!mLN4 after his finalist placement last edition.

Hello and I owe you the absolute pinnacle of congratulations on achieving 2nd place in o!mLN4! How would you say that this tournament's iteration went, and how are you feeling about being able to shake history by almost bringing it all to a bracket reset in Grand Finals?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/--Pavin--.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267">--Pavin--</a></p>

It's pretty good. I didn't think I could get points against ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610), but I never intended to give up and persevered through, getting a couple of points. When I went away avoiding a 0 point sweep, it felt really good.

Harkening back to the tournament's previous iteration back in 2022, you managed to place Top 6 in Finals, falling short to ::{ flag=US }:: [Nepijin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11734610) who you would eventually face again in the finale of this tournament here. How would you say you have developed since then to be able to chase the placement in this edition's podium?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/--Pavin--.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267">--Pavin--</a></p>

I believe I improved a lot even over the years. 2022 was a rookie year for me, where it was my first year participating in tournaments. I started with 4DM4 as mainly a rice player, eventually moving to 4KMWC 2022 where I changed my gameplay skin and improved in playing LNs, but was not good enough. In o!mLN3 which was my first LN Tournament, I pushed hard to become an LN-dominant player, where I qualified as seed 7, which was already incredible for me. The tournament's overall difficulty in patterning got much harder this year compared to in 2022, but I was encouraged and determined to get into the podium, as I already achieved the maximum potential needed to make my best run.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/epic_man_2.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000">epic man 2</a></p>

You have had quite the ride in the past few months with not only this tournament in hand, but also handling insanely competitive matches over in the 4K Mania World Cup 2025 alongside Solo Score Rush and Touhou Project Mania Cup 4th for example, as well as setting some of the most monumental tournament scores in this year alone. From this point onwards, what would you say are your plans for the future? And where your current run will take you as time goes on?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/--Pavin--.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12046267">--Pavin--</a></p>

I am unsure if I will be able to play in more tournaments, as I would like to focus on academics and continue into university, but I may consider joining a few tournaments within my capabilities, maybe 1 to 2 of them. However, I guarantee that I will continue to improve in my physical abilities.

Warmest of welcomes to you both, and congratulations on the success of this edition of the long note tournament franchise! As a general starter question, what would you say was the main objective that you two were aiming for in terms of constructing the mappools throughout the tournament?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/[Crz]Crysarlene.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871">[Crz]Crysarlene</a></p>

o!mLN4 is one of the most ambitious tournament projects from the hosts themselves, and personally I wanted to push the limit of how tournaments can test players within subcategories of LN skillsets in a competitive way. As a result, we tried to incorporate as many LN mappers and customs to fulfill this objective on the mappools themselves.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/epic_man_2.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871">epic man 2</a></p>

This one is for you Imperial – as one of the newer mappooler additions to this iteration's team, how would you say was the process behind balancing the mappools for this year and what makes this tournament different from most other ones? Given there was a ton of prep for a variety of the maps chosen.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5066305" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/ImperialTrinity.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5066305">ImperialTrinity</a></p>

The objective balancing of the pool is a really difficult concept, since it is basically playing 5D chess, where we not only balance mappools within each specific round, but also progressive difficulty increases into the later rounds, how it scales comparatively to the previous iterations, as well as overall difficulty as a standalone.

Ideally this would be how things would go, but there are a lot of other factors as well that make it less than realistic. So the best approach was to sort of take these as "guidelines" and just try to make the pools more enjoyable as a whole, and any "anomalies" would be more as a quirk than a blemish. Trying to have the pools as a puzzle piece will end up with something too rigid and too constrained. Treating it as a more freeform piece would ultimately serve as one of the better decisions, as it can allow individual mappers shine with their creative approach. Any "error" would just become a "happy little mistake".

This tournament is the culmination of some of the best people in the tournament scene, as there is so much individual talent that can be portrayed in a variety of ways. Having so many talented people allows for their uniqueness to be portrayed throughout the entire process. The diversity in approach allows us to strive for instead of a "perfect/fair" result, but a "complete" experience, incorporating all elements and not just a tournament experience, but the long note experience.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/epic_man_2.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000">epic man 2</a></p>

And this one is for you Crysarlene – having mappooled for the previous iteration alongside being involved with the tournament's humble beginnings in 2019 and 2020, what would you say are the main differences between the prior iterations in terms of the mappools themselves?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/[Crz]Crysarlene.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871">[Crz]Crysarlene</a></p>

Compared to the previous iterations, we tried many things, such as a different mappool structure, a higher abundance of custom maps, mapping around original songs, and mappool diversity. We also scaled up the difficulty of the overall mappool according to many players' LN skillset compared to the previous iteration.

This iteration, we offer a mappool that tests LN players in the most all-rounded difficulty possible, starting from the humble early-game, with elementary LNs testing consistency, to the gradual step ups in difficulty as the rounds progress, to the upper limit of how hard LNs can realistically be in tournaments. Taking into account the maximum skill required to tackle the Grand Finals mappool in o!mLN4, we can consider it as one of the hardest LN pools ever made in osu!mania history.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/epic_man_2.jpg')"></a>

Now for the aftermath of this tournament after 3 years since the previous edition, what would you both say is the next avenue that lies ahead for the two of you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/[Crz]Crysarlene.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871">[Crz]Crysarlene</a></p>

This tournament is definitely one form of us sharing how the LN competition could be on such a large scale like this. One thing for sure is to share to community that LN exists as one of mania's metas which has its own ceiling in terms of gameplay, it could also be very competitive in some way, and most of all is to share the fun of playing LN, because back to the essence of playing is for having fun after all.

Many may know [arcwinolivirus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089) as a top osu!mania player from the Philippines since 2014, eventually turning into various avenues of opportunity in the tournament, from participating in the older 7K osu!mania World Cups, to creating some of the community's most popular ranked maps and more importantly, the first of the 4K LN Tiers. Fast forward by a decade and counting, they've contributed a voice acting role in visual novel–esque story sequences in this tournament.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

Hello and thank you so much for joining us in this interview! You've been around for ages with a well-known name in the osu!mania community, which seems like a unique avenue to take the U-turn into voice acting from. How would you say this opportunity came to be?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/arcwinolivirus.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089">arcwinolivirus</a></p>

Thank you so much for having me and for the warm introduction. It is quite moving to look back and see how far things have come since I first joined this game. What started out to be just a simple passion for rhythm games became a major part of my life and the game turned out to be osu!mania. These days though busy in life, I've been doing well, still gaming and mapping, enjoying new maps, meeting new players and even streaming where I still keep being connected with the community whenever I can.

As for taking on the role of Leon in o!mLN4, it was something I never expected to do but it felt like a step forward as I want to experience something new. When the opportunity came up, I saw it as a chance to contribute something special for the osu!mania community. Bringing Leon's character to life was challenging yet fulfilling at the same time and I hope everyone enjoyed all the hard work, including all the people who contributed in this tournament.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/epic_man_2.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14566000">epic man 2</a></p>

How would you describe your experience voice acting "Leon" for the story cutscenes showcased on the tournament's stream?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/arcwinolivirus.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2039089">arcwinolivirus</a></p>

Voicing a main character for the o!mLN4 tournament was a challenging yet a memorable experience. Since voice acting is not common in osu! tournaments, it was exciting to bring a character into life. I had fun voicing Leon's lines in the script and it felt so satisfying to see the end-result of our work. The opportunity taught me a lot of things about voice acting thanks to the people who I worked with and guided me through. I'm proud of you all.

I believe voice acting has great potential in osu! tournaments and community events as it brings a brand new experience to everyone. It provides more emotion, personality, and excitement for both players and the audience. I am looking forward to more story-oriented tournaments like this in the future!

## Final thoughts from the hosts

::{#howtoplayln}::

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-09-osumania-ln-tournament-4-concludes/HowToPlayLN.jpg)

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/HowToPlayLN.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600">HowToPlayLN</a></p>

My motivation at first for producing the originals was to troll the mappers, in other words I want them to break through the limit of what they can time and map in osu!. As the time passed, the goal shifted from making technically difficult songs to chart, to making music that tells a story, "hears" you, makes you experience the journey and actually pay attention to the music as an art form.

The tournament's initial idea originated from the theme and story of [LNCryption](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1893946). Alongside establishing the lore for o!mLN4, we included a lot of subtle details to ensure that the production would align with what I hoped to see as a player or a mapper — to make beatmaps and songs with a unique taste of their own, regardless of map and original. You can actually say this tournament is somewhat like a table full of Leon's dishes, with Eizou spicing things up in a way.

With the tournament's concept and lore constructs, I worked on a number of originals for this tourney. I experimented with the storyline a lot. For example, [Illusory -never trust what you can see-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGEC0zLGtgM&start=14) is an imagination of Leon in a nightmare or hallucination so I knew I was going to make it the most harmonically unhinged thing possible. For music nerds out there, yes, I used 12-tone rows to make the chord progression for that song.

[Variations on Transcendence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0w3-ki2RYw&start=14), was intended to take the form of symphonic speedcore as the collaboration between nm-y and me made it possible. It ended up being a really beautiful narrative piece for Misaki with the hardcore touches from nm-y himself.

One more track that I want to mention about is [Entrance to Ordeal In Illusion](https://soundcloud.com/indekkusu/entrance-to-ordeal-in-illusion), which is the amalgamation of a player's experience in the tournament. I took some inspirations from the [Battle Theme of Inazuma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYP2dM8RTFM&pp=ygUQZHVlbCBpbiB0aGUgbWlzdA%3D%3D) from Genshin Impact, combined with one of my favorite Thai composer works, [N. Prangcharoen: Piano Concerto "Luminary"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmhkl15222g). It was a dream to also include the live performance in my music, so I decided to request [Ethereal_Winter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9780417) for Soprano and [Yennie](https://www.youtube.com/@choonieyen) for a Sheng performance. Both had really amazing performances and it was a blast to work with them.

Despite all the ideas we started out with, we had been going through a lot of writer's block and crippling perfectionism during the production phase. It was not all sunshine and rainbows — we rewrote a lot of music, scrapped literal pieces, and collaborated a lot more before achieving what you now witness today. This is especially so for Illusion's End, where we only had a good idea at the beginning of this year despite embarking on the song composition since 2023, with the song production only ending in the middle of October 2025, during the time that I crammed assignments in my postgraduate studies. Glad we actually finished it!

My goal as a composer is to build and communicate stories through music. Even as o!mLN4 ends, the story surrounding Inverse World of Nouille is yet to be concluded. We may have future projects focusing on worldbuilding for Leon and the other characters in this tournament, so stay tuned for the next project that we will embark on!

If I had to sum up the meaning of o!mLN4 to me in one word, it would be a 'journey'. A very long and arduous one at that.

I believe the seed of ambition had been planted since I witnessed the mappool showcases for osu!taiko Malaysia Tournament 2022 to support a couple of composers featured in it. I was running o!mLN3 at that time, and I felt a new thought gnaw at my mind - How could I bring high-quality graphics and meaningful productions to the osu!mania tournament scene?

Little did I know, that pang of impostor syndrome brought me down the rabbit hole of tournament production. I started out making short videos detailing lore for [4 Digit Mania World Cup 2023 (4DM23)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1671710?n=1), which was part of a tournament series I had dedicated half my mania career playing, staffing and hosting. From then, HowToPlayLN had become a close collaborator of mine, and we went on to create music and graphics for other community tournaments and the BMS of Fighters (BOF). By the time 2023 had ended, I was already working for the World Cup Design Team, and had a hand in 26 other productions for 2024.

It was from there that I started to gather my experience, finances and connections to put together everything HowToPlayLN and I hoped to present in o!mLN4 - the story of a noodle chef haunted by illusions of his past mentioned in the lore of 4DM23. In this production, I wrote up an [entire script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fs3_s3cpLfrQNvJKG0T8WOHSozqjKgeOrTYk435O7uo/edit?usp=sharing), and made different plot points the premise on which all originals and their designs/animations were made, which allows for both player immersion and viewer interpretation. For the sake of brevity in this newspost, I have left the production breakdown for every original and element related to the stream overlay [here](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/o!mln4-design.pdf).

Taking both the good and the bad I had learned from over 30 tournament productions, I worked tirelessly with different departments for over 2 years to coordinate both map and design. On some days, I was the director of an animation, the product manager of our custom stream overlay, the scriptwriter, the music/design quality assurance, and even the designer or mapper myself. But ultimately, I communicated my vision of the tournament, and had reliable mappers, designers, composers and engineers add in their personal flair to my vision.

Now looking back at the tournament itself, the competition was great, but whenever I revisit the designs and animations created for o!mLN4, I am reminded that they carry a lot more meaning than just a colorful visual present just for the sake of it. The videos/designs tell a story, and the hard creative work put in by every composer, vocalist/VA, designer and mapper behind the scenes. And that is how I envisioned the tournament to be — more than just a tournament.

And if all of this does not sound like a journey to you, then I am not sure what is. It was a lot more suffering along the way, waiting for deadlines to be fulfilled or delaying them, creating scopes for every song/design, managing strained finances and logistics, juggling real-life work with the production, emotionally dealing with cancelled projects, etc... but in the end, I can confidently say that I have learned a lot about the techniques involved in production, and that the process is what truly made me a changed person, from mere host to production lead — this tournament is merely the fruit of this 2-year labor.

Coming this far, I do not harbour any regrets for this tournament. It was the best it could have been 2–3 years in the making. And facing the uncertain future, I am sure all the skills I have picked up along the way will continue to shape my identity, wherever I end up in life from here.

This rounds up o!mLN4 and everything that went down in the tournament.

To close out, we would like to thank all participants and the audience for supporting the tournament, and highlight the contributions from 99 individuals who made this ambitious collaboration between music, art and mappools even possible to begin with.
