There's been a void in our Featured Artist library for too long, and **WhiteSakata** is here to fill it.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/512/header.jpg)

With inspirations like [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) and [*seatrus*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/185), you should be able to guess exactly what kind of music **WhiteSakata** makes. When also considering the fact that they've been [an osu!taiko player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15400295) for the better half of a decade, your suspicions should be confirmed: **WhiteSakata** has a knack for hyper-intense electronic tunes that perfectly fit rhythm games.

**5** top-tier tracks can be found on [**WhiteSakata**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/512), soon to be downloaded and mapped by you.

If you have ears, listening to these previews is your next step:

If you've been following the Featured Artist video saga of the last few weeks, you'll already know that a bunch of osu! players were at [a certain LAN event](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-09-16-osu-uk-epic46) recently. That's where the one and only [MALTESER](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5218178) played [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2407278) hosted by [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929)!

How does one make a map? Here's your personal tutorial: go to [**WhiteSakata**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/512), open a `.osz` in your osu! client, then place objects however you heart desires. If that doesn't work for you, supposedly you can use your brain while mapping too.

That's all for now, but next weekend may or may not bring more music to your doorstep.

Stay tuned.
