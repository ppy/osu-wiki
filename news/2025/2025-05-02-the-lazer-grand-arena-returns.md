The Lazer Grand Arena is back for its 2025 edition, with a new format and streamlined entry! 

![](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA/2025/img/lga2025-banner.jpg)

Building on community feedback, this year's LGA retains the defining elements from the last iteration like cumulative scoring and the qualifier playlist, while also giving players more space to strategise with their picks and bans. There is also a new Lazer Mod mod category, with unique gimmicks tied to the new lazer mods!

As always, for more details pertaining to the tournament, please refer to the **[Lazer Grand Arena 2025 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA/2025)**. You can also discuss this event in the **[official discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2075057)** or the public **[community server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H)**.

## Registration / Qualifier stage

No sign-up required — **just play!**. You can find the playlist in-game by searching for "[Lazer Grand Arena 2025 - Qualifiers](https://osu.ppy.sh/multiplayer/rooms/1338320)" (hosted by [LeoFLT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3668779)).

To participate, simply play in the official playlist starting **Sunday, May 4 at 19:00 UTC**. You'll have **one week** to complete the **12 playlist maps**, with a total of **18 tries** to use as you see fit. The only requirements to participate are to play **every map at least once**, and to not have violated any of the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months. The **top 32** players will advance to the bracket stage.

## Bracket stage

This is where we've had most changes from last year. The bracket starts as single elimination, transitioning to double elimination at the **top 8** (Quarterfinals), offering more matches between the top contenders. Tiebreakers are no longer sightreads, but still are **osu! originals** made just for the event.

In this new format, players take turns in both banning and picking maps, much like a regular tournament. We've also added protects — maps which can't be banned by either player, and may only be picked by the player who protected them.

The cumulative scoring aspect is kept in the way of a "set" of two maps, one picked by each player (following the AB-BA order), that is, the first pick for each set will alternate between both players until the match is decided.

In a set, **the scores for the two maps are added for both players, and highest score wins one point**. The first player to score 3 points wins the match (best of 5 sets). If the score reaches 2–2, the final set becomes a 3-map showdown, ending with an osu! original.

Whether you're aiming for the top, or just here to watch the showdowns ahead, there's never been a better time to jump in. See you in the Lazer Grand Arena!
