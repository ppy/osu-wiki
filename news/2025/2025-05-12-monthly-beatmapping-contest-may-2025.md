Let's face it. The [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) has a boring name. That's why there are mappers (you!) who make the contest properly interesting each month.

This month's contest is for **osu!** and **osu!taiko** mappers. If you want to map for another mode, the next contest is only a month away.

This contest's restriction: **all sliders must be straight lines**. Due to a higher-than-usual submission count, this contest started with [screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) before moving to the [judging phase](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging).

Since as far back as 2021, **phyr** has been pumping out maps for the Monthly Beatmapping Contest. Despite *still* having 0 Ranked maps, **phyr** has proven that you don't need to be an established mapper to join the hall of fame as one of osu!'s *Elite Mappers*.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Limitation, restriction, gimmick, concept — what you call it doesn't matter. This is a contest-specific mapping rule that all submissions must abide by, ensuring that this month's contest is different from last month's, and the one before that, and the one before that, and... *(message truncated)*

If you're confused about how these work, ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) (for osu!) or [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko).

#### osu!

According to the [ancient mapping lore](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Basics#jumps), mappers in ye olden days would sometimes use *new combos* to indicate *jumps*. In the current mapping climate, jumps are used everywhere, so that concept has been thrown out the window... but the MBC is here to bring it back!

This month's limitation: **all objects within a combo must have equal spacing.**

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-12-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2025/combos.jpg)

For the pedants out there, "spacing" is based on pixel distance between objects ([this thing in osu!(lazer)](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-12-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2025/lazer.png)), *not* distance spacing multiplier ([this thing in osu!(stable)](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-12-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2025/stable.png)). The latter can be manipulated with slider velocity, which would defeat the point of this limitation!

There's a lot of room for confusion in this concept, so if you have any questions, this news article's comments section is a good place to ask (or [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) if you want some privacy).

#### osu!taiko

While Kats and Dons are the foundations of osu!taiko maps, they don't have to be.

This month's contest is themed around the lesser-used objects: **create a map focused on spinners and sliders**!

More specifically, your goal should be to incorporate spinners and sliders in a way that feels natural. You can (and should) use mainly Kats and Dons still, but with extra attention paid towards other object types!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!
