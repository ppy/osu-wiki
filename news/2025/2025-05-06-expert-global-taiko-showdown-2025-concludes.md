With 157 players, 157 staff members and a whopping **37** original songs made by **49** individual composers, this year's tournament is without a doubt the best one ever since the creation of the GTS series, breaking every precedent and boundary that has ever existed in order to live up to the moniker of "Arena of the Gods".

## Summary

Massive applauses to our podium finishers, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073), ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910), for creating such an unforgettable final week!

Since the start, we saw every top player from around the world returning, fighting neck and neck with perseverance to get as far as possible. Everyone had predictions on who would come out on top, but certainly no one expected it to come as close as it had been. From a PERFECT, FULL SS of the Qualifiers (yes this actually happened), to the close battles in the brackets, all the way until the Grand Finals week, where we witnessed the 11-minute-long tiebreaker being played twice, and a bracket reset!

Read on for a detailed rundown of the Grand Finals and [other highlights from this tournament](#match-highlights) below.

## Grand Finals recap

</div>

Those familiar with EGTS will know that the Grand Finals matchup always used to be fairly one-sided due to the skill disparity between top-seeded players:

- In 2020, ::{ flag=CA }:: [janitore](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3307897) went up against ::{ flag=JP }:: [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719) who sought to flip the script after being knocked into the lower bracket in Semifinals. uone proceeded to sweep janitore into a bracket reset and finished the job by defeating him 7–2.
- In 2021, ::{ flag=JP }:: [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501) and ::{ flag=JP }:: [Seren58](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15252950) gave us the closest Grand Finals scoreline thus far with ekumea1123 resetting the bracket with a 3–7 victory, followed by a 7–4.
- In 2022, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Seren58](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15252950) came back to defeat ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) with a crushing 7–1 victory.

History seemed to repeat itself as ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) pulled ahead with a 5–2 scoreline against ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357), and most were expecting one of the best HD player in osu!taiko to win the next pick of HD2. Yet, miraculously, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) found catastrophic misses in the final ten seconds which swayed the point, to the shock of everyone, to ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357)'s bitterly held FC.

Three more consecutive points were tipped towards ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) with mostly razor-thin margins, save for a commendable 90k lead on HR2. At this point, all of a sudden, he was one point away from resetting the bracket.

::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073)'s final pick was between one of two incredibly painful maps: NM5, a chaotic polyrhythmic experience, and DT1, a speedy accuracy nightmare. His choice fell upon NM5, but no one could've anticipated the back-and-forth that ensued.

For the first and only time in the history of EGTS, players and viewers alike would be treated to a true world premiere: a genuine Grand Finals tiebreaker; an 11-minute gauntlet at the end of a nerve-wracking one-hour match to decide whether ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) would be crowned the final EGTS champion, or whether he would have to prove himself all over again. By the end, ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) won with a 47,159-score difference.

Both players were given a desperately needed 10-minute break, as the bracket was reset.

---

The new match started yet again with a show of force in their own picks, yet the advantages didn't make for easy wins. Neither player willing to give up, both continued to flaunt their ambitions at the champion title.

For example, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) found a *1.042 million* HD score on FM3 to win the point, yet it would be impossible to overstate ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357)'s FC with **HR** on his opponent's reading and accuracy-heavy pick.

Both continued to not give away any of their own picks, but it was apparent that something had changed in ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073)'s mind. A 2x100 HD FC on FM1, a *halving* of his previous 100 miss count on DT2 (albeit still losing the pick), and his **near SS** on HD2 showed the audience just what kind of determination he had brought to the match that he wasn't willing to give up on.

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

    </video>
</div>

However, everyone began to worry that all of this might not have been enough, as the scoreline was still tied at 5–5. The smell of another potential tiebreaker lingered in the air.

::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357)'s final pick was HR2, one which he had handily won in the previous match. However, despite some narrow misses at the start and at the end of this pick, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) didn't waver once, reducing his miss count from 73 to 7 and getting tantalisingly close to 99% accuracy, leaving ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) in the dust and securing himself the first break point of the bracket reset.

With a 5–6 lead, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) doubled down and picked HR1 — a pick which, again, ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) had won previously. By adding insult to injury on the home stretch, ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) finished with an FC, replicating his opponent's feat from the previous match with much better accuracy to boot and denying his chance at another tiebreaker.

::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073), the favourite to win since the very beginning, became the final EGTS champion, but absolutely no one could've anticipated what it took him to get there in the end.

The Grand Finals of EGTS 2025, much like the entire tournament itself, was a spectacle second to none. To have two of osu!taiko's most prolific players push each other to a tiebreaker nearly twice is a historic moment that none of the hundreds of people watching live are sure to forget any time soon.

## Match highlights

### Round of 64: ::{ flag=KR }:: applerss vs. ::{ flag=CL }:: Teruyama

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9bTn_umKvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Let's start off these more "miscellaneous" match highlights, with one of, if not the closest match in the Round of 64.

The outcome was all but predictable in ::{ flag=KR }:: [applerss](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/983349) and ::{ flag=CL }:: [Teruyama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9057823)'s first-round match. Despite the major differences in global ranks — applerss at #3 and Teruyama at #128 — and their seeding in EGTS (28th and 37th, respectively), the match was incredibly close. Every single map played on the players' respective picks was decided by a margin of less than 20,000 points, highlighting just how evenly matched they were. Both competitors showcased impressive skill, making it one of the most intense matches of the round.

### Round of 32: ::{ flag=JP }:: hz404 vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: Shamirin_mzk

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH8JYE3raG0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Round of 32 then started, and what a lineup of players to start off with. ::{ flag=JP }:: [hz404](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14947043), ranked at #14, winning the 2023 edition of [Squad Global Taiko Showdown](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1703263) and finishing 3rd in [Project Prism](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1909279), facing off against ::{ flag=JP }:: [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757), ranked at #42, winning the 2021 [Continental Global Taiko Showdown](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/CGTS_2021) tournament, as well as [TWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024) with the Japanese team.

With both players having both significant achievements on both the solo leaderboards and tournaments, the match was bound to be exciting. And exciting it was, with the third map, [(The) * Red Room](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325015#taiko/4983573) ending with a 1,382-point difference, giving the win to ::{ flag=JP }:: [hz404](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14947043), for his first point in this match, as ::{ flag=JP }:: [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757) was leading by 2 points at this point.

Somehow this was "only" the third lowest score difference. ::{ flag=JP }:: [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757) scraped the match to a 4–4 tie on [Luminosity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325073#taiko/4983703) by 1,325 points, and just before the tiebreaker, the match got *even closer* on [Taffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2324286#taiko/4981586) with an absurd **57** points bringing both players to match point.

As for the tiebreaker's result, well, how about you go check it out on the VOD itself? You won't be disappointed.

### Round of 16: ::{ flag=JP }:: supesan vs. ::{ flag=US }:: mBiscuit

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ta-RvWKRi64" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Now, for a departure from top players facing off in extra early rounds, for Round of 16's highlight, we will be talking about a match-up of two very underrated players. This match is between ::{ flag=JP }:: [supesan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14623658), who, despite being #185 on osu!taiko's performance point ranking, seeded #8 through our Qualifiers, and ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174), who achieved a very respectable seed of #46 considering his pp-based rank, being #411.

Nothing really announced this to be such a close match. Although ::{ flag=JP }:: [supesan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14623658) definitely has a higher skill cap thanks to his rank, ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174) is possibly one of the best players in terms of reading and gimmick abilities, and this match showcased all of this in the most perfect ways possible.

Between ::{ flag=US }:: [mBiscuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17061174) winning on [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2328983#taiko/4994070), [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2328977#taiko/4994051), [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329063#taiko/4994258), [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329068#taiko/4994266), [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329039#taiko/4994216), a mix of reading, consistency and gimmick picks, and ::{ flag=JP }:: [supesan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14623658) winning on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329033#taiko/4994202), [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329049#taiko/4994233), [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329034#taiko/4994203), [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2328994#taiko/4994086), [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329036#taiko/4994210), and the [tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329073#taiko/4994275), the more mechanics-focused picks in this pool, this match made for one of the most interesting contrasts to look at for such a close match.

This clip right below summarises very well how stressful matches in EGTS are to watch.

### Quarterfinals: ::{ flag=KR }:: Peaceful vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: kanten_07

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3TCnlziD6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Now we're into the late stage of EGTS. This is probably now known as one of the biggest upsets in the entire tournament, knowing how good ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) has always been at this level of tournament performance, and it reflected in the pick'ems, with 90.5% of votes predicting the win going his way.

However, ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) was prepared to prove us wrong, in every way conceivable. The first 4 picks went as planned for both players, each of them winning their respective picks for a tied match. But then, ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) picked [HD1, *parallel skydive*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2332962#taiko/5006346), and this was the start of the most unexpected run, as he would get 10 misses, whereas ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) just went and FC'd it. Despite being known as a No Mod player mainly, he went and stole away a point on a slow SV HD map against the best reading player in the game.

After that, the match went on for 3 picks in a row, where neither player could even win their own pick, especially with [Fortuna for Tuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2333012#taiko/5006460) being won by ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) with a 112-point difference.

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

    </video>
</div>

Back to a tie again at 4–4. With each player having one pick left, they manage to both win their respective picks, although it was by 5,429 and 2,567 points respectively, with the last one being especially impressive to look back on...

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-peaceful-vs-kanten_07-2.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

Tiebreaker reached. 5–5. No other way out of this than by going through the gruesome gauntlet that is [Atomic Disassembler](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2332724#taiko/5005638). The first half was quite trivial for both players, scores separated by 6x100 by the time the second half started, and somehow, still maintaining the same score difference by the time the slowest SV section ended.

By the time of the song's breakdown section, the misses started coming in. ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) missed 3 in a row, and ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) traded them back with 15 in a row. Everything seemed hopeless at this point, even with 4 additional misses from ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027), but then the very last section came up...

There are no words for what ended up happening.

    </video>
</div>

::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) won in one of the most exciting ways a tiebreaker could end, namely by a slim 3,775 points, and advanced to the Semifinals in the winners' bracket.

### Semifinals: ::{ flag=KR }:: Peaceful vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: _Kan2

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4r-YGyv7k4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

We're now in the first round of Semifinals for the losers' bracket with a legendary line-up of players to say the least. On one side we have ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027), current [Project Prism champion](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1909279) and 4-time TWC podium finisher. On the other side we have ::{ flag=JP }:: [_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196), having one of the highest skill caps for a tournament player despite not playing in tournaments, showcased with his unmatched 2-miss score on [TremENDouS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1632807#taiko/3332914), EGTS 2021's Grand Finals tiebreaker, and being the only player that has won both Squad Global Taiko Showdowns of 2021 and 2023.

Now, how could this match between such juggernauts of osu!taiko go? Picks for both players were pretty unsurprising, with ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) choosing the reading aspect of the mappool, with [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336583#taiko/5016186), [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336561#taiko/5016142), [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336375#taiko/5015685), [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336556#taiko/5016129), [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336545#taiko/5016102), and [NM6](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336555#taiko/5016128), as a mechanics-oriented final pick. For ::{ flag=JP }:: [_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196), we ended up with [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336548#taiko/5016113), [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336550#taiko/5016115), [NM5](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336559#taiko/5016136), [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336376#taiko/5015688), [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336557#taiko/5016130), and [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336377#taiko/5015689). This entire match went according to plan for the first 4 picks, but ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) then lost on HD1, losing the slow HD reading map for the second match in a row, and giving ::{ flag=JP }:: [_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196) the first break point of the match.

Sadly for him, this would not be the last break point, as ::{ flag=KR }:: [Peaceful](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165027) ended up retaliating by first winning [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336376#taiko/5015688) in dominating fashion (an FC), then tying up the match, and finally, winning [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336377#taiko/5015689) in one of the most impressive break points imaginable, with just 483 points to decide the whole match.

### Grand Finals: ::{ flag=JP }:: Maimaing vs. ::{ flag=JP }:: kanten_07

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

</div>

Here we were, the final match deciding who would face off against ::{ flag=JP }:: [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073), in the Grand Finals of EGTS 2025 the following day.

Everyone was expecting this match to be extremely close, especially as it was a revenge match from Semifinals, where ::{ flag=JP }:: [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910) came out on top at 7–5.

However, this time around, the story of the match was very different, with each player winning their 6 respective picks. An absurd sight to behold.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/maimaing-vs-kanten_07-1.png)

With no choice but to play one of the longest and brutal tiebreakers in osu!taiko history, both players vied for the chance to aim even higher in this tournament.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/maimaing-vs-kanten_07-2.png)

However, with the first quarter of the map done, it started looking hopeless, as ::{ flag=JP }:: [Maimaing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14520910) was already 23,145 points ahead. With ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) being 31 misses behind, this seemed like a done deal, especially with none of the song's hard parts having come up yet.

And yet...

Whatever it was that happened in his mind to hit all of this, this was the turning point of the map, as ::{ flag=JP }:: [kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) took the lead and never looked back, winning by a jaw-dropping 7,627 points.

EGTS, and GTS as a whole, has already been known for its immense contribution to original song releases in the osu! sphere, having released **73** songs in its existence, prior to EGTS 2025's release.

Due to that, we think there were a lot of expectations on how many there would be, especially with [COEGTS 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023) including 29 bespoke songs, the most for any single tournament.

That record stood unbeaten to this day, or well, until EGTS 2025 was finalised, with a grand total of **37 original songs** released for this tournament. [You can find all of them on the wiki.](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#expert-global-taiko-showdown)

Clicking the song banners will take you to the respective beatmaps. We will be highlighting just the tiebreakers in this article, as well as a very special collaboration track.

### Round of 64

[blobdash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8337877) makes his return to GTS in grand fashion, with [VOID ELEVATOR](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash/void-elevator), returning after his three songs provided to [EGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022). He's become a reliable part of GTS since then with many recurring contributions:

- The Grand Finals tiebreaker for [RGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/RGTS_2022)
- The main mappool's NM1 for [COEGTS 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023)
- BGM for the story sections in [EGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022) and [COEGTS 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023)
- Mastering Engineer for our [BespokE : GTS 2023](https://gratiaproductions.bandcamp.com/album/bespoke-gts-2023) album.

With a track that has waited 2 years to be able to release, he has still managed to make one of the most impressive tracks to start off the first round of EGTS 2025 with, and the map provided by [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) and [Shinsekai-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) has helped players ease into the high level of gameplay that EGTS is shooting for very well.

### Round of 32

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/banner-conviction.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2325087)

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-conviction.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

We then moved on to quite a different style for this tiebreaker, being a more rock/speedcore-focused song, rhythms changing all over the board. This was a song of professional grade, despite the composer, [trailmix37](https://soundcloud.com/trailmix38), being completely unknown with just 52 subscribers on SoundCloud and not a single osu! map submitted for any of his 4 past songs. That said, if you were to play this without knowing any of this context? You would not notice it whatsoever.

Mappers [davidminh0111](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) and [SolaEclipse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2140739) did not hold back after hearing this song, with some of these sections vying to trip you up no matter which mod you choose, and you can see this even in the matches where players attempted this map.

### Round of 16

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/banner-the-great-revelation-by-mother-brain.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2329073)

    </audio>
</div>

This one is just shooting to be a massive bomb. Welcome to 5 minutes of frenchcore by [Mothtek](https://soundcloud.com/mothtek).

A massive departure from the melancholic hype that the two prior songs possessed. A song by one of the more prolific artists in the Japanese hardtek scene. A song named "[The Great Revelation By Mother Brain](https://soundcloud.com/mothtek/mothtek-the-great-revelation-by-mother-brainegts2025-round-of-16-tiebreaker)". When does it stop? The answer is never (figuratively).

Mappers [Ideal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3869519) and [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) tried to reel this insane song in a bit by toning down the mechanical difficulty compared to the Round of 32, as it instead aims to be played with mods by the players left, but even then, it is a struggle for sure.

### Quarterfinals

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/banner-atomic-disassembler.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2332724)

    </audio>
</div>

[Atomic Disassembler.](https://soundcloud.com/yusuke-7328/atomic-disassembler)

This title summarises the goal behind this song pretty well. The tiebreaker for this year's Quarterfinals by [CS4W](https://soundcloud.com/yusuke-7328) is a Gothic Hardcore song mixed with Hi-tech and Drum & Bass elements, an insane mix of genres to be sure.

The map by [My Angel Seia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17797595) has absolutely nothing angelic about it. The easy parts are when 220 BPM streams are mapped at the normal SV, but whenever you see an SV slowdown in this map, the only answer is to run, frankly.

### Semifinals

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/banner-white-tiger.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2336579#taiko/5016172)

    </audio>
</div>

[Xyris](https://soundcloud.com/itsxyris), being no stranger to the osu! tournament scene, definitely understood the assignment here as well. He throws out crazy mixes of speedcore and dubstep to make for some of the most challenging bursts.

In conjunction, mappers [Briesmas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2865172) and [MTNTWarz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2865172), heavily accompanied by head mappoolers [4sbet1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671) and [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650), have created one of the most daunting maps in this tournament for sure, having the second-highest star rating among this tournament's tiebreakers.

### Finals

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/banner-justice-rectifier.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340085)

<div class="osu-md__paragraph">

    </audio>
</div>

[Foodbot](https://soundcloud.com/foodbot) and [Type R](https://soundcloud.com/hiimtype_r), two brand-new artists to GTS this year, joined the GTS regular [SDMNE](https://soundcloud.com/sdmne) to create [Justice Rectifier](https://soundcloud.com/foodbot/justice-rectifier).

This whole song was quite the challenge to even finalise for everyone involved, being born out of another song that was cancelled last-minute, hence the production period of 2 December 2024 to 9 March 2025, finishing exactly 7 days before release. However, nothing here shows any corners being cut. This is one of the most melodic songs in our late stage, mixing hardcore techno, gabber, as well as hi-tech.

With a map by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767), [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/532171910), and [kei821](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5846289), who were forced to complete it in a total of three days, it did not disappoint and made for an amazing experience overall.

### Grand Finals

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes/banner-absolute-disorder.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343534)

    <audio controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/egts-2025-absolute-disorder.mp3">
    </audio>
</div>

This is the only non-tiebreaker song to be discussed here, but with good reason to do so.

Our Grand Finals HR2 pick, [Acute Disarray - AbsoluTe disoRdeR](https://soundcloud.com/abs_dsr/absolute-disorder), was an original song released for EGTS 2025, but also a 4-way collaboration with three of the rhythm games we've worked with throughout EGTS.

[Acute Disarray](https://soundcloud.com/abs_dsr), a unit of [AiSS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCySx3jmK0bjwiwix_EoKm4w) participating for [Orzmic](https://twitter.com/orzmic), [rN](https://soundcloud.com/rurinn) participating for [Phigros](https://twitter.com/Phigros_PGS), [takehirotei](https://soundcloud.com/takehirotei) participating for GTS and [Riya](https://soundcloud.com/riyaelectronic) participating for [A Dance of Fire and Ice](https://7thbe.at/), have now released the song on each respective game.

The sheer scale of this collaboration is definitely absurd, and the map made by [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976) for it definitely follows it through, ending up as a defining pick for both Grand Finals matches.

Due to the special collaboration aspect of the song, we ask others not to map it, but to instead wait for a full spread on all game modes that we have planned. Do give it time.

The final song of EGTS 2025, the Grand Finals tiebreaker, truly speaks for itself: [《wr/d.:colliders》\~Chaos in Conclusion\~](https://soundcloud.com/blobdash/wrld-colliders) by the GTS Sound Team.

This song involved **20** composers, **35** mappers, and **15** designers to create **11 minutes** of song, beatmap *and* a full **music video** to top it off.

You'll find the [map here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343549) if you dare challenge it, but you can also enjoy the full experience in the video above.

[kanten_07](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357) finished at 2nd place for this year's EGTS with one of the most surprising bracket runs in the entire tournament, forcing the closest Grand Finals in EGTS history.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

You've had the most impressive run in this year's EGTS, with a lot of upsets to your name. How did you feel after these numerous upsets you managed to get, and how did you prepare for them?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/kanten_07.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357">kanten_07</a></p>

Thank you! Personally, I was more surprised than happy when I won Quarterfinals against Peaceful and the first round of Grand Finals against Grape_Tea. To be honest, it didn't really set in that I had won.

Shortly after, the realisation set in that I had actually won, and I was very happy. I hung out with other players after winning and reflected on the positives and negatives of the game.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

Are there any other players in the tournament that surprised you with their performance during the tournament?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/kanten_07.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11680357">kanten_07</a></p>

In the tournament, we essentially had the same practice schedule every week: on Monday and Tuesday, we would figure out the map trends, the order of picks and bans for most of them, and which maps would increase our chances of winning.

By Wednesday, we had made enough notes of most of the maps, and on Thursday, we fixed finger placements and color pattern recognition in order to make those notes consistent with a real performance.

From Friday until just before the matches, we didn't practice all that much, but played the maps as if we were playing a real match, checked if there were any weak parts or habits to note, and if there were, we simply tried to correct them.

The two people that surprised me with their performance were [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) and [chibamasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16067522):

- [Grape_Tea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9540073) really surprised me by SSing every map in the Qualifiers, and with their overwhelming consistency in the map pools every week.
- I played against [chibamasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16067522) in the Round of 32, and I was impressed when they FC'd every FM map with HDHR and when they SS'd the NM5 map. Their HD skill and overall consistency really surprised me. Their HD2 play at the All-Star Showcase was impressive as well.

[4sbet1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671) was one of the head mappoolers for this year's EGTS, having helped tremendously in terms of improving communication with Japanese users, as well as having worked on a huge part of the general mappooling with [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501), especially for later stages.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

Despite being a top player for years, this mappooling experience has been your first ever on an international tournament. Coming in with such a big amount of restrictions, with the mappool being fully custom-mapped, involving a lot of original songs to balance into it as well, how did it feel organising all of this?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/4sbet1.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671">4sbet1</a></p>

To be honest, I thought it was a really interesting challenge!

At the same time, I felt a lot of pressure — considering the obligation to keep so many amazing custom/collab songs confidential until the end, and the responsibility to provide maps that live up to their difficulty and quality...

Also, in order to use each custom/collab song in the most optimal way, it was necessary to analyze the elements of each song and each slot in every round and assign them appropriately. The process of trial and error, rearranging the slots to find the right balance, felt like solving a puzzle — it was genuinely fun.

(By the way, I'm not a top player... I was already an old man two years ago!)

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

This edition of EGTS has been the first one to involve so many Japanese users in the mapping and playtesting team, thanks to your and ekumea1123's effort. How was the ambience like in such a staffing team, that had two very different languages being spoken, as well as vastly different cultures over the game?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/4sbet1.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11563671">4sbet1</a></p>

When I first became a Head Pooler, I never expected that people from around the world and the Japanese community would come to build such a warm and close relationship.

For Japanese Taiko players, who are usually part of a relatively closed-off community, EGTS2025 has undoubtedly been a powerful and positive influence!

This outcome was made possible thanks to the GTS community members, who opened their hearts and reached out to us! We Japanese need to learn from this kind of open-mindedness as well.

To be honest, ekumea1123 did more work than I did, and I also received a tremendous amount of help from [Briesmas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2865172), [goheegy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8057655), and [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650). Please don't forget about them either.

A brand-new addition from this year's GTS releases, [Foodbot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759) has been one of the most active composers in EGTS, working on **4** different song projects for this tournament alone. They took part in creating the [Finals NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340046#taiko/5026842) with the Spaceport Sound Team; the [Finals tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2340085#taiko/5026904), *Justice Rectifier*, with [Type R](https://soundcloud.com/hiimtype_r) and [SDMNE](https://soundcloud.com/sdmne); [the Grand Finals No Mod 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343520#taiko/5037773), *deadline chasers*, with [Kyotsugyon](https://soundcloud.com/kyotsugyon); and last but not least the [Grand Finals tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2343549#taiko/5037847) megacollab.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

You were one of the composers that participated in the most original song released in EGTS, having been involved in 4 of them. With all of these having been collaborations, how did it feel having to tackle all of these vastly different organisations, and what have you felt was the biggest challenge while working on this tournament?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Foodbot.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759">Foodbot</a></p>

It was interesting. I honestly think since most of them are in context of a collaboration, it's not as much work as I'd imagine. For 'deadline chasers', Kyotsugyon was handling most of the composition and arrangement (I did most of the hitech stuff though), and I barely lifted a finger for 'Strive;'.

《wr/d.:colliders》... it's a weird story. I had listened to Kry's part beforehand, and thought "Oh, he wants someone to make This kind of drop." ...but I never really loved making that kind of drop, so I wanted to make something that people will least expect but still sound very good.

Like I said in wrldcollider's youtube comment: "I took Kry's buildup, threw it, and violently crushed it to the ground." (Please note that I don't hate Kry.exe at all. I respect him a lot.)

I was also asked by the host like this:
"speed"
"please"

So, um. there you go. LOL. Speed. I didn't even know of the name 'splittercore' before EGTS 2025, i just thought of super-fast speedcore overlayed with dubstep drums to make it hit harder than it normally would.

Some people also say I'm "on crack". I promise you that's not the case.

Justice Rectifier is another layer of hell. I've never made any tiebreaker songs before, and looking back, I somewhat wish I didn't make it as slow as 170 BPM as a starting point. But it definitely gives it its own vibe for a tiebreaker.

When asked by the hosts to transition to a 200+ BPM section, I was hesitant on what to make. They shared some references that would fit the theme, and what I think what I ended up making was super unique. Although some people mistook it for Type R's part, I can't blame them. I would've thought the same.

I'm planning to detail more of the music-making process for Justice Rectifier on youtube at some point. Hopefully by the time this newspost is published I would be able to finish it in time.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Kasumi-sama.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263">Kasumi-sama</a></p>

You were already involved in osu! in the past, having provided songs to [VNMC 2024](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1933172), as well as the [osu!Collegiate League](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1974503). While having worked for two different game modes already, was working on a song for an osu!taiko tournament any different, and what were the things you were mainly paying attention to while composing, compared to usual?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Foodbot.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/35127759">Foodbot</a></p>

I was provided references for each slots. I was also given regular feedback by mappoolers so the composition fits more in a osu!taiko setting, and that was definitely the BIGGEST difference compared to other tournaments where I had only recieved "make whatever you want" prompts.

I wasn't really paying attention to anything other than composing based on the references I've been given, but I always take the feedbacks in mind, because in the end I'm making this song for a tournament, and I got to make it fit somehow.

Also because of the feedback, I get a better understanding of osu!taiko patterns in charting.

In the end, it almost feels like I'm making a song for a music label, and it's an incredibly refreshing experience.

It 100% was a super fun experience for me personally, being able to work with so many different music artists and come up with all the visuals for so many different things, and the chances to collaborate between the different designers on many of these projects is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I think many viewers of EGTS are equally as excited as us, waiting for each week's new visuals for the custom songs, so I just hope everyone enjoyed the designs as much as we enjoyed making them.

How was the working environment like in the tournament, especially in the designers' channel? Did engaging with other designers and musicians help motivate your creativity?

Most of the originals are done with lots of coordination between the staff and the various Illustrators/Designers/VFX artists so it is pretty well managed and organised, though the deadline chasing was definitely something that May Have Taken A Toll on some of us so it is stressful to say the least LOL.

About the designers' channel... yeah. The world probably needs to see the design channel and all the dumb things that happened on there (which by the way is renamed to `#anything-but-design` so feel free to make of that what you will), but having a group of designers that so frequently banter and talk about dumb things in the channel during the making of EGTS helped a lot in managing the stress and many of us have bonded because of this and have had even more chances to work together outside of the tournament since then.

Creativity-wise, it was sometimes challenging because having to come up with a new design (especially when some of us are taking more songs than others) for each song while trying to make it unique amongst each other is a difficult thing to do, but the designers usually will share a lot of inspirations from other people's art and design which helped making it easier for me to find a starting point when starting to work on it. The collaborations between the designers and/or illustrators also have given birth to many creative new art from the combination between 2 (sometimes very distinctly different) styles of work, which is very refreshing to do.

[overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847) has been a force to be reckoned with in tournament staffing over the years, taking on playtesting for numerous osu!taiko tournaments. EGTS was no stranger to this, as he was the head playtester for this tournament as well.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

While having been the main playtester for this tournament, having playtested half of the pools nearly entirely by yourself, how hard is it to keep in mind your own player opinions, as well as trying to balance them what would be best for the mappools?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/overdahedge2015.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847">overdahedge2015</a></p>

I wouldn't even say this is necessarily hard, more so just tricky, and being in a smaller pool of testers definitely doesn't help.

To perfectly account for your own personal biases, you'd also need to know your exact skillset, as in, how good you are at X compared to Y for just about every relation between two skills, and getting most of the way there isn't too hard if you have some self-awareness but everyone whiffs on it sometimes: I called grand finals HR1 "too easy" but it was still getting misses out of the podium players even without buffs that I was hoping for!

To be fair, I was never there for the sake of testing the late rounds, and I have to thank [miyagishima](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8027517), [kitafuma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8987606), and [Seren58](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15252950) for carrying me on that front, but the same idea can happen in any given round really. A handful of opinions is so much nicer to work with than one, and for a while I really did feel like the only playtester doing anything, but in EGTS' case the head poolers were all top players and all did a ton of work for the tourney, so they thankfully had their own judgment to work with.

After your experiences in tournaments, how do you think the tournament scene should move forward with its mappool system?

I sort of have two answers to this.

As a staff member, I want to say there's a reasonable future where all mappools use only fully licensed music and can still be great, but while it's getting easier every month i think it's still very hard to execute when you don't have the sheer manpower a tourney like EGTS has.

As someone that's pooling for RGTS right now, it's unreal, and honestly a bit demotivating, the amount of times I have thought "oh this map would be great", then looked in the source field and saw that the song's from another rhythm game, but we're still making it work, with the help of a good but not EGTS-level amount of custom mappers.

As a player, I think the current pool structure is honestly great! I think being too picky makes pooling hellish, and as long as polyrhythm HR1s stay away from me it's all okay in my book.

As a final way to wrap up this whole article, we thought there would be only one way to ask our staff members to finish the very last EGTS edition, so here it is:
