The one and only **MEMODEMO** is now inside of your computer.

In the past few years, **MEMODEMO** has been spotted wandering the coasts of *Arcaea*, in the deep caves of *Lanota*, on the outskirts of *Rizline*, and in even more habitats frequented by rhythm gamers. **MEMODEMO**'s migration has taken yet another turn today with a massive showing in our circle clicking territory.

**7** new pre-timed tracks drawing inspiration from artists like [*AQUASINE*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/467), [*BilliumMoto*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38), *Sasuke Haraguchi*, and many more can be found on [**MEMODEMO**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/508)!

If the name "**MEMODEMO**" sounds familiar, that may be due to their presence in the renowned [*HARDCORE UTOPIA*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/205) series. If you're recalling something more recent though, it's probably their new track created specifically for this year's [osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025):
