The [osu!mania Long Note Tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN) is more than what the title may initially suggest! It's an open-rank, free-for-all osu!mania 4K tournament series where all featured maps are predominantly made out of long notes (LN) — introducing long notes to competitive and casual players alike since 2019.

During our third iteration in 2022, we had the honor of hosting **164 registered players** duelling it out for the title of *Best LN Player* through a high-stakes, double-elimination bracket, witnessing some of the greatest matchups known in the history of osu!mania 4K.

Thanks to the initiative of the mapping and production team, [o!mLN3](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/3) also saw the creation of **56 custom maps** and **4 original songs**. If you would like to listen to our original music, be sure to check out the [full list on the wiki](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music#osu!mania-ln-tournament-3).

## What's new this edition?

This year, we open with a mysterious title, **Inverse World of Nouille**. We not only hope to bring top-tier rivalry between many of the stars of the tournament scene, but also step up massively in terms of overall production. From vast lineups of music to stunning illustrations, you can be sure of finding your favorite bowl of noodles among those we have to offer!

Is the competition too tough for you, yet you don't want to miss on all the fun? No problem! To put our original tracks under the limelight as well as to encourage participation from both spectators and eliminated players alike, we will also be hosting **Ordeal In Illusion**. This is an event that will be running in parallel to the tournament and allow anyone to battle for the highest score on original songs.

To participate in Ordeal In Illusion, you will need to authenticate your osu! account through a bot within our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/W6zs7mEjxY). You will then be able to compete for the highest scores on our original tracks released every week! Aside from bragging rights, all participants earn **Lucky Draw Tickets** based on their standing on each original beatmap's leaderboard, giving them a non-zero chance to win the Lucky Draw and take home part of the prize pool.

Whether it be the competition, prizes or the production itself, you will definitely have your fill this year — it's all on the house!
