In case you're unfamiliar with what you're reading (or living under a rock), Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to determine which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All the beatmaps are chosen by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/contributors) of their respective game modes. You can click on the banners below for each pick to vote on the poll for that map, and there is a description underneath each banner written by a Loved captain. There is also a [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120) as well if you want to view the polls directly. The voting stage lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote!

More info can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh).

[Chaqueno Palavecino - La Ley y La Trampa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/876611#osu) by [MaestroSplinter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6707918)\

*description written by [momoyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12469536)*

*Disclaimer: This description was written by Mismagius, a Brazilian. Opinions about Argentina may be biased.*

Okay guys, I think we can all agree that PelÃ© was better than Maradona, right? Yeah, thought so.

In all seriousness, here's [ChaqueÃ±o Palavecino - La Ley y La Trampa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/876611#osu), a classic Argentinian folk song by renowned mapper [MaestroSplinter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6707918). While this is a fairly standard map, it's still high quality. It's no wonder that it has over 500,000 playcount and over 700 favourites!

MaestroSplinter's map is very good, I really love the patterns and jumps of the map. However, I don't like the fact that there are no streams since I bought a Rapid Trigger keypad, and I wanted to test it. I can't play the map with Double Time, but it's very fun with Hard Rock. Vote yes if you want an Argentinian song in the Loved section!

As a tribute to this map, I shall proceed to write in Spanish by myself, without the use of any translation tools or corrections, because I know my Spanish is perfect.

El mapa de MaestroSplinter es muy bueno, me encantan mucho las patronas y los saltos del mapa. Pero no me gusta el facto que no tiene arroyos ya que comprÃ© un keypad Gatillo Rapido y me gustarÃ­a testarlo. No puedo jugar al mapa con Doble Tiempo pero es muy divertido con Roca Dura. Vota sÃ­ si quieres una canciÃ³n argentina en la secciÃ³n Amada!

Lost Umbrella? I got you!!

Coming in with the Popular Playcounts this month, we got a good classic song with a very known graveyard set that deserves more recognition... The comments also do not lie this map is RLLY fun to play, which is something that made this mapset popular back in the day it was submitted.

With a solid 500K plays and over 450 favorites, and also a full set from 2 to 6 stars difficulties, I'm proudly bringing up this set for the Loved section for those who either played this before and/or wish to see it with a leaderboard!!

Want to enjoy some old alt mapping in Loved? You're in the right place!

This 2014 mapset by god themself, [jonathanlfj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/270377), is something that caught my attention a while ago. All of this map is super enjoyable to play. Whether it be the patterns, flow, or rhythms, it doesn't disappoint in the slightest.

When it comes to this song, it's also worth mentioning how nostalgic it is, as it's a very old Nico Nico song from the 2012's. If you're either an old Vocaloid song enjoyer or a very old osu! player, you would recognize some players (Cookiezi) playing maps of this song right away.

To me, this map is very fun and the song is a hood classic, thus it deserves to be Loved in my humble opinion!!

*description written by [momoyo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12469536)*

A long time ago, the community was very united by the use of the osu! forums...

This set is a result of that, a huge collab between iconic Japanese mappers starring [terametis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102152), [alacat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/869782), [Gamu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/611174), [Guy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/91738), [Laurier](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/700010), [NewRulerNA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605540), [Patchouli](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/137168), [Quilt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/352740), [Satellite](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1661227) and [wring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/275300)!

Nowadays, seeing mappers of the same country make a collab like this is very rare, but 10+ years ago it was more common.\
Now, talking about this map, it is a very simple old anime-style map, mostly with sharp flows and simplistic rhythms, yet it's very enjoyable. It truly reminds me of that one map that got hvick225 #1 back in 2014.

It's a beautiful start to June! The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and yet another DEMONIC AIM MAP rises from the ashes for this week's Daredevil Difficulties.

Back from [last year's 4WC](/wiki/Tournaments/4WC/2024), legendary aim mappers [bad boy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3545323) and [melonboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3053382) reunite to bring you [hasu - Pile of Corpses](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2196123#osu/4647035). This pick is a true NM1 gauntlet, featuring relentless 220 BPM aim patterns that only the most skilled can handle with ease. Hopefully you guys can add this to your weekly nomod aim routine: 30 sets of [JTB crazy night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1359228#osu/2812690), 20 retries on [kigurumi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1315615#osu/2726346), an hour of pile of corpses and you'll be setting 500s in no time.

Give it a shot and vote yes!

I'm gonna let the comments speak for this one;

> this set bangs

> Sad that this is not ranked. It should at least be Loved. I really like this beatmap.

> fun to play

They're completely right! While this is a Ranked Reject pick, it remains one of THE MAPS the community enjoys the most. I'm honestly surprised it took this long for this to be nominated for Loved, a full spread, from Normal to Expert, carefully made for the players to enjoy!

[Blind Stare - Shotgun Symphony++](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392658#osu) by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048)\

Brought to you by one of the first to test the limits of players in the early 2010s, [Blind Stare - Shotgun Symphony++](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1392658#osu) mapped by [Mismagius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) is this month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* slot!

This map is absolutely brutal â€” and for good reason. This is intended to be a massive step up from the infamous [Shotgun Symphony+](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/7671#osu) mapped by [awp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2650) over 15 years ago, as indicated by the additional plus in the song's title. The top difficulty features dozens of incredibly precise patterns at CS7, ranging from old-school sliders with no margin for error to the iconic aim control bursts inspired off of awp's original renditions, now toned up to the max.

There is also a CS5 difficulty for those who perhaps struggle with the consistency and raw aim required to pass this gauntlet of a map.

If you want to see this mapset sail its way into the Loved section, be sure to vote "Yes" to show your support!

A beautiful voice paired with beautiful sliders. What a wonderful beatmap [Danny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2121386) has created for us that we can still appreciate more than 10 years later!

I want this beatmap played in my lobby.\
I want this song played at my funeral.\
I want you to vote YES to see this Loved now!

This month's *wildcard* pick is... INSANITY

This 2021 beatmap made by [iljaaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8501291) was a mapset I used to glaze a lot back when it was submitted. This map is SICK!! When it comes to patterns, flows and rhythms, it doesn't disappoint, especially in the kiai section with the curved 1/4 sliders, which impressed me the first time I ever got to see it... A very well-known 9â˜… tech map, played & loved by many.

For this month's second *Wildcard pick*, we're bringing back more Demon Aim for June ðŸ‘¹... Please welcome, [Hana - tree (Sped Up Ver.)]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1711023#osu)

As an aim-lover myself, im thrilled to see [tsundereSam](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6357685) back in the Loved section! This map serves as a spinoff to their previously Loved and popular set of [Sakura no Uta (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/811908#osu/2281045), featuring a plethora of awkward aim elements that flow together seamlessly.

Make sure to not under-aim that YES button in this month's polls if you want to compete in this map's leaderboard!

This map is for players who truly love the game.

[Fishmans - Long Season](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1921232#osu/3965583) is a 35-minute journey where [SowAA](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8401548) crafts an incredible experience meant to be fully absorbed. A 6.2â˜… marathon might not immediately catch your eye, but as the late Fishmans' ambient soundscapes course through your veins, it becomes something surreal â€” something that words can't quite capture until you experience it yourself.

As this month's final Wildcard pick, I hope you'll give this one a try.

This month, we bring you another [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) classic: [FAKE TYPE. - Knickknack Kingdom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1832070#taiko/3760587). This map was featured as a custom map for [SGTS 2023](https://gratiaproductions.com/2023/sgts/home) Quarterfinals, and its reputation amongst players in the tournament and the community was definitely very well received. The map consists of swingy beats and bursty patterns, making the mapâ€”despite its intermediate star ratingâ€”a great challenge for players at any skill range. The song itself is also super catchy, in which I personally believe Raphalge does a great job capturing with the colouring and slider velocity changes. If you're looking for a fun swing map for your tingling fingers, make sure to check this map out, and cast your precious "yes" vote to it!

Introducing one of \_Rise's most well-known graveyarded maps: isla!

isla is a captivating Frums track combining the styles of psychedelic trance and footwork, creating a perfect song for \_Rise to go wild on. Featuring weird snappings, 1/6, 1/8, and some amazing sv, this map is a recipe for success for many taiko players who enjoy tech.

This map was originally made for the [EGTS 2021 semifinals](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2021#semifinals), so you can definitely expect a challenge!

*The heat is abnormal.*

**Begin mission KELT-9b.**

[Heat abnormal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2176545#taiko/5142071) is a vocaloid megaset featuring a crew of 7 astronauts from across the globe. Seasoned spacemen like [Z419](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9912966), [\_gt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8301957), and [Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) need no introduction, but even a few fresh cadets have found their way on the mission too!

Introducing [Daanny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7183087) â€” a renowned scientist known for isolating a heat anomaly of about 4050Â±180 Kelvin, an academic feat that even future generations will learn about. Next up is [vzlen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22676825), a prominent scholar, who secured his seat by demonstrating absolute expertise in astronomy, publishing numerous theses surrounding exoplanets and space objects. And lastly, the Japanese duo, [Ikakun4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11293254) and [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757). Through Shamirin's countless explanatory monologues, Ikakun managed to cut the travel time in half, securing the flight's ability to return to planet Earth.

The main goal of the mission is to reach the newly found exoplanet KELT-9b, although you're going to be the one who chooses the difficulty. 5.47â˜…? 7.13â˜…? 8.82â˜…? 11.83â˜…?! It's all up to you! Brace yourself for all sorts of challenges such as traversing through gimmicky galaxies, holding your consistency on various constellations, and dashing through dark matter at double the speed.

The future is in your hands. Vote.

Oh sorry, I was just playing a game of Tetris, or should I say, a game of *TETORIS*?

That's right, as if this song hasn't made enough noise already, we're also bringing it to the Loved section! TETORIS is undoubtedly Hiiragi Magnetite's most popular song, even surpassing Marshall Maximizer. Although there was an insane amount of TETORIS taiko sets sitting in the graveyard section, (18 to be exact), this was the one that stood out to me the most.

[TETORIS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2277268#taiko/4853178) is mapped by none other than [layxa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14800030). Interestingly enough, layxa is [a VERY good TETR.IO player](https://ch.tetr.io/u/layxa), displaying an U rank in the Tetra League. I mean come on, he even cleared 40 lines in 27 seconds! Anyway, TETORIS has 4 difficulties and the easiest one is made by [Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574). It recently found its place in the [Taiko World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025), where it was a HD2 for the round of 32. Doublets, 1/6 quads, funky rhythms, you name it, but wait, there's more! The T-Spin DOUBLE difficulty takes this trend even further. There are just so many 1/6 patterns that it could land itself in a 1/6 practice pack! Sadly, the diffname doesn't actually indicate a double BPM difficulty...

**JUST KIDDING!** The TETRIS difficulty is here to save the day. 340 BPM is not exactly the easiest but if you're one of those maniacs who think it is I have one last surprise for you. Can you *ALL CLEAR* the last difficulty standing at a whopping 9.79â˜…? There are no let-ups! Just pure 340 BPM madness, hell you could even think of the map as one long stream if it wasn't for the 1/6 patterns!

Now, enough has been said. Go vote (with ***teto***rizz)

ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º It's swing time. ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ

There's a reason why [BIBBIDIBA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2207301#taiko/5011428) was one of [TWC 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025)'s most picked maps! The original song by Hoshimachi Suisei, which is already a banger on its own, got [a fresh new remix by AL-1S and UZQueen](https://soundcloud.com/tendouaris/bibideba_uzqueen). This map continued the swing NM2 trend back from RO16 and because everyone *loved* it so much, it's now put up for Loved voting!

Expect the usual swing stuff from this map. Many many doublets mixed with 1/4 patterns, fast 1/6 bursts and even a slow section in the middle! Even though this was a NM2, the usage of mods is for sure going to keep you on your feet.

Secure the pick for your team and make sure to click the yes button in this month's polls!

For better or for worse, [TWC 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025) has seen the abolishment of notepad gimmicks for good. I thought this would be a great opportunity to showcase what the average gimmick map looks like now. Let's jump right into it :D

[j9fqo80fdgcr](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2350992#taiko/5059144) (how do you even pronounce this bro) is a TWC 2025 Semifinals gimmick map, although there's a fun twist to it. No yellow notes, no barlines, no unorthodox gimmicks. You might be wondering: "How do you even engineer a gimmick slot for Semifinals without notepad editing???" SV, SV, SV, and SV. There's only so much I can explain via this newspost, and you're definitely gonna have to play the map yourself, but be ready for flying notes and doublets, extremely low SV, awkward SV with snapping changes and continuous slowdowns.

Believe it or not, it's also time to welcome an absolute mapping legend into the Loved category â€” [roufou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1109122). It's actually crazy that a mapper who's on the mapping team of basically every taiko tournament still hasn't had his Loved debut. You might recognize him from [Fractured Angel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1838114#taiko/3774272), [Karasu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2148481#taiko/4525819), [SCREW // owo // SCREW](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1230293#taiko/2557747) or [Get this drums](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2023371#taiko/4214627).

Do you like loud snares, beeping, eccentric cowbells and jersey club? No problem, this is just what the doctor ordered â€” *more dariacore*.

Crafted by [Fahrenheit7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3439745), with some slight SV changes, snapping differences and overall chill vibes, *Biri-Biri* is a great challenge to both new players looking to expand their skillsets as well as reading veterans looking for high leaderboard spots. So if you enjoy gluing your eyes to your screen, vote this map a "Yes"!

[taylor - pave paradise](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2155527#taiko/4543461) by [chmekoe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7807444) is up for Loved voting! *pave paradise* is a custom map that was featured in [Taiko World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024)'s Round of 16 as HD1. Due to it being picked in an early week of the tournament, most of *pave paradise*'s difficulty comes from reading and timing, as opposed to the difficulty of patterns themselves. This is done by featuring a wide variety of smooth, engaging and very fun SV that makes deciphering the patterns and hitting them in rhythm much more difficult! Due to the mixture of high and low scroll SV as well as patterns with frequent SV changes, *pave paradise* is a map that will test all angles of your reading especially if you choose to play it with HD as it was in TWC!

Enjoy!

[Crowley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6341006) is well-known within the community for his chaotic but beloved style of mapping that stands out among the rest. It has been two long years since his last appearance in the Loved Section, so why not have some more?

His [Wild Side (ft. Jonah Scott)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1419344#fruits/2924004) map is no different from what you would expect of such a mapper and song pairing, if not even wilder. Featuring a blend of explosive funky and jazzy rhythms combined with an uncomfortably low approach rate and a high circle size, it is sure to be a challenge no matter which mods you decide to play it with. Whether it's a ruthless reading challenge or a fierce precision test, it's up to you to decide your weapon of choice in this hunt.

Will you be able to tame this beast of a map?

If you're familiar with the osu!catch tournament scene, you've probably come across the [Duck Duck Pony - Shinsetsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/951270#fruits/1986612) mapset.\
Thanks to each map in the set featuring an uncommon AR setting and unique, high-quality patterns, the entire mapset is often considered during the map-picking process in tournaments.\
Regardless of whether the tournament is aimed at beginners or top-level players, mappoolers can always find something that fits their concept in this mapset, hosted by [wonjae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5032045).\
Make your choice and climb the leaderboards on these maps with any mod (or NoMod) you like â€” and trust me, whichever mod you choose, you'll have a lot of fun playing it!

Known by the community for their fast, intense, and challenging maps, [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284) is on their way to claim their 14th (!!!) Loved mapset.

[Bassline Yatteru? w (Cranky Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1037471#fruits/2169000) has gained a lot of popularity among players for its fun, high-speed gameplay and pattern choices that were rarely seen in the Ranked section at the time, making it a common sight in various multiplayer lobbies around 2019-2020. The map maintains its intensity from start to finish (with the exception of a long break in the middle, which you're definitely going to need), serving as a great test of stamina and consistency for high-level players.

Definitely give it a try! If you dare, that is.

*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

The SV situation is crazy.

Eliminate's SVs have been a pretty common thing to see in the wild. *Moisture*, however, is rather unorthodox as a song: it samples a [really interesting bump from Moistcr1tikal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6EXY2zg4LU). The attached video goes into the initial process to turn that sound into an entire song section. I thought it was really enlightening and I do recommend watching it. *Moisture* as a full song released a while after that video, also attaching [Moistcr1tikal's own reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFEmYwMc1IU) to the initial remix.

(Description author's note: not the way I straight up googled "eliminate moisture" to get the video url, just to get advice on how to lower humidity in my house ðŸ˜­)

[BlackyDay'](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5724831)'s journey as an SV mapper has been pretty interesting to watch, especially coming from my own French perspective. From what I recall, he was basically experimenting with a bunch of ideas here and there, and considering helping for national tournaments, and then international tournaments, in both of which I sort of mentored him into eventually leading into a completely independent mapper role within the [SV: Summer Exhibition 2](/wiki/Tournaments/SVSE/2) tournament. As with many SV mappers, BlackyDay brings a rather unique perspective to SV mapping, with pretty strong instincts to boot.

*Moisture* as a map is mostly a dynamic reading challenge, compounded by some tricky parts that you'll have to train a little bit to get a feel for it. It has a certain vibe that is heavily influenced by BlackyDay's own musical interpretation, which is translated into an SV experience that feels ever so slightly different and refreshing compared to other more conventional reading entries.

Did you hydrate while reading this description? I did not do so while writing this description, only a bit before that. And I'm currently doing so in bed at 1 AM after spending 3 days at an anime convention, and I am completely spent. Very much sweaty and moisturized even. So I hope you'll vote for this one. In the thread per usual.

*description written by [Silhoueska Elze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

It's crazy to see a chart of this caliber get a chance at being put into Project Loved, but with the caliber of players nowadays, I can definitely see why [Credens Justitiam](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/982719#mania/2056576) deserves to be here.

\[[Crz\]Zetsfy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9299072)'s charts generally test you a lot in physicality, and this chart in particular really tests a lot of that on the stream side. While it starts off with light jumpstreams, it immediately throws you into very dense stream patterns containing a LOT of anchors on many of the columns, forcing you to read this chart very carefully while going very fast. Another thing that makes this chart so difficult is its relentlessness: as long as the vocals are still out there, you are going to have to traverse your way through the streams and anchors that are present in the entirety of the chart.

Thankfully, there is a break section after the first set of streams, but by this point, I'm sure you've already exhausted so much of your energy playing the first half. By the time the break ends, you'll have to brace yourself for another set of streams, which I'd argue that at this point, it would be much harder to keep up due to how much stamina you may have already lost.

This is a battle against the best of the best players in the physicality department, with players really trying to not fall behind and ensuring that they can keep on going despite the challenges they face. Truly, this song fits the difficulty of the chart, and I think that such an epic song and this chart deserves its recognition.

If you want to see more challenges which really test the limits of the playerbase in the Project Loved scene, then I think this chart really deserves to be voted for Loved.

[edamame](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1670003#mania/3410947) gives a breath of fresh air in terms of chordjacks. Most charts nowadays contain very difficult ones, which tend to be very dense, and extremely fast. Thankfully, [Couil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6872025)'s chart is friendly towards many players in terms of getting an A, or an S; however, this presents a new challenge to every player by testing how good their internal metronome is.

Accuracy is certainly an important factor to chordjacks, and this chart primarily focuses more on that rather than something physical. Through this chart, your fundamentals will really be tested, and I'm very sure that we are going to be seeing a lot of scores above 997,000 on the leaderboard. If you think the base chart isn't hard enough, luckily for you, different rates are available, starting from 1.0x and up to 1.4x. With the Double Time mod, much faster rates are definitely possible, and I can't wait to see how everyone does regardless of the rate that they choose.

It's honestly really cool to see more charts from Couil. This chart really showcases their charting ability outside of the SV category. If you agree with this, then I think that this chart definitely deserves to go for Loved!

If you play Etterna, then it's very, very likely that you know who [Doshowz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5799435) is. If the name doesn't sound familiar with you, then maybe the name [XingRen](https://etternaonline.com/users/XingRen) will. Regardless, they're making their first appearance this month with [Fire in the sky (feat.Kanae Asaba)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1920978#mania/3965033)!

Vocal dumps are what you'd usually recognise Doshowz for charting, and this is a great example of how they'd approach one. Originally uploaded so [4DM2023](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2023) could use it in their Round of 32 pool on 1.05x rate, it still maintained popularity afterwards due to how accessible it is for a vocal dump. If it wasn't already apparent, this chart is on the easier side of dumpy stuff, only checking in at 3.5 stars, making this a great introduction for players who haven't quite exposed themselves to vocal dumps yet.

As for most cases, if you seek a greater challenge, there's always uprates for you. The great thing about this is how well the rates scale, with the very directional approach leading to higher rates feeling equally as good as the base rate.

Enough of my talking, go give this well-known charter their chance at a first Loved nomination by casting your vote!

[Space Battle](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/480116) is a song that I'm sure many might be familiar with, and I think [LastExceed](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6232245), [Curiossity](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6490035), and [placticine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6454618) gave this song justice.

There's many difficulties to try out here, where players can choose from easy to more challenging ones. Something to note about all of these difficulties is that there is a mix of rice and LN patterns. Some SVs thrown into there as well, especially on the higher difficulties. Did I forget to mention that these charts last 5 minutes? Consistency is definitely going to be key in every single part of the charts, wherein you have to weather the different patterns while trying to ensure that you can still accurately hit them.

I think I'm going to let the chart speak for itself and let you guys look at the surprises that this has prepared for all of you. It's about time these three charters also get their entrance to Project Loved, and if you agree, do not hesitate to vote "Yes" on this chart.

Perhaps you already recognize [Ticle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11602148) for how unique their approach to charting is. This month, we're giving you something no different than that, as we give you [Kairikou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1735388#mania/3546866)!

It's a challenge just to describe how exactly this song was charted, but the one thing I can say for sure is that it works. Like, really works. The entire chart is dumped, using a combination of rice notes and long notes to make an extremely flowy experience, which ultimately leads to an overall enjoyable chart, even if some may consider it experimental.

Maybe long notes aren't entirely your thing, but I'd still be willing to say that you can find enjoyment in it regardless, as they feel almost natural due to the way it plays.

Putting everything into words is a big challenge for this, and many other Ticle charts, but the most I can do here is to tell you to give it a try (and your vote)!

We're back with a cool rice stream map.

We're introducing [Guitar to Kodoku to Aoi Hoshi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1926450#mania/3977896) by [ExNeko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7590894), who's been away for a while!

ExNeko is a well-known, experienced mapper who's been super active in the tournament scene lately. This map, used in the [MCNC 7K 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1680870?n=1) Quarterfinals RC3, has a light density and smooth flow, making it a great example of a stream map.

It also features a variety of stream patterns arranged to the structure of the music, making it a clean and well-designed map that can be recommended even for 7K players of intermediate skill level.

If you want to see more sets like this in Loved, don't forget to give your support.

Featuring very famous and outstanding music, this map has been featured as stage 2(tech) in the [7K 5th Dan Course](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/451788#mania/969188), also known as the last mercy to 4K main players. We understand that for many 7K players, the requirement of achieving 96% accuracy is too simple. However, achieving a high accuracy, or even SS, will not be an easy task. In summary, you can set challenge goals for yourself based on your own skills, setting aside the Dan Course guidelines. If you enjoy this music or beatmap, or are ready to participate in the challenge, we would greatly appreciate it if you cast your vote for this beatmap!

If you're familiar with the 7K mapping scene, you must have heard the name [Mochineko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196) by now. Formerly known as Critical_Star, he has charted countless extremely difficult 7K maps and gained significant traction over the past few years. Now, we're excited to present his first-ever Loved chart: [-45 - G e n g a o z o](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2176501#mania)!

This chart features a full-spread chordjack map, designed to help players develop the physicality and coordination needed to master these jacks. As you progress through each difficulty, you'll refine your skills and adapt to the demanding patterns. Loved maps rarely feature content this challenging, and 7K chordjacks are particularly uncommon â€” which is exactly why we want to showcase this map to the Loved audience!

We're thrilled to finally nominate this map and hope you agree it deserves a spot in Loved. What are you waiting for? Cast your positive vote now!
