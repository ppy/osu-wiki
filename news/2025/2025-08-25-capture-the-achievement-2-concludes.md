Capture The Achievement 2 has concluded, with 2649 completions across 104 teams!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-06-21-capture-the-achievement-2/banner.jpg)

For those first hearing of [Capture The Achievement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-06-21-capture-the-achievement-2): it's a scavenger hunt event built around the idea of medal hunting. Teams earn points by completing "achievements" with custom requirements. Many have hidden requirements, similar to hush-hush medals.

This was such a packed two weeks of achievement hunting! With a non-stop stream of achievements, teams spent hours everyday on solving puzzles, deciphering achievements, researching, racking their brains, and going a bit crazy.

Let's go back and look at some highlights of [Capture The Achievement 2](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/2).

## Top place finishers

The competition for the top spots was fierce, with 1st place frequently swapping throughout the event ([timelapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=553VEjgSx5k)).

After the dust initially settled, **Pawsome üñêÔ∏è** and **osu!friends** take the lead, swapping spots throughout the first two days. During the third day, **bc3 ultra** catches up and briefly holds first, before it returns to **Pawsome üñêÔ∏è** vs **osu!friends**.

However, come the 6th day, **Magic's Animals** shakes up the leaderboard, taking **Pawsome üñêÔ∏è**'s #2 spot, though with several other teams close behind, it's not easy to maintain. After 3 days, **Magic's Animals** crumble, leaving **Pawsome üñêÔ∏è** and two new teams fighting for 2nd: **thought it was a normal tourney** and **EXEC_with.METHOD_METAFALICA/.**.

All the while, **osu!friends** maintains their huge lead in 1st. However, around the 12th day is when they begin to worry, as **thought it was a normal tourney** puts the #2 battle to rest, turning it into a battle for #1. Both teams are fiercely gaining, when after 2 long days, the #1 spot finally switches. 

After this point, the momentum continues, as **thought it was a normal tourney** pulls even farther ahead, trying to secure 1st place. With only 2 days left, there's not much time for **osu!friends** to make up the huge gap. The 1st place spot has been secured. 2nd place, however, is not.

**Pawsome üñêÔ∏è** has been following behind in 3rd this whole time, and within the final hours of the event, they're able to pass up **osu!friends** for 2nd place.

Congratulations to the top 3 teams!

### Sound in Motion

| --: | :-- |
| Description | What is a map/chart? To answer that I started to play various maps and charts from diverse games, starting with osu! Standard, osu! Taiko, osu! Mania and osu! Catch, and then I decided that I was too restricted to just play things from osu!, so I decided to venture out and play other things like, Wacca, DDR and SDVX to get an idea of what is important. But after all that, to be honest, I just don't know, they are all so different, each one has more than 6k rules to follow and that doesn't even count what I need to even do things for MWC and similar. But I could notice the passion, so for that I decided to put a bit of my passion in this too, like messing with sliders with some inspiration from mappers like idke, although I need a break. Hope you like it! |

This achievement certainly had the most time and effort put into it, with even a custom map from [TamamoLover](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7772622). It was made to be a quite difficult achievement, so congrats to the 5 teams that completed it! Here's a comment from [-Rinne-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13407431) about the achievement:

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

So, Sound in Motion uh? Well, this was by far the longest achievement from concept to execution that I ever made (5 months). 

It started back in March when I was working with audio files and had the idea to learn Steganography, this eventually brought the original idea for the achievement when I proposed making one related to it as a "sequel" to Vex. Originally it was supposed to be a pretty simple achievement where you just had to find the numbers in the mp3, with the hints pointing right at it. But that was found to be just too boring and quick, wasting a good idea. The second iteration on the other hand had the intention of adding the slider anchor art or just slider arts with the string of numbers in a single difficulty, but like the last time, the achievement was still missing that extra part to make it perfect, and then it hit me, 12h before release, what if I named every diff "expert" in different languages, quickly realized that I couldn't do anything with that and then it hit me... What about just rhythm game difficulties? And it was perfect. 

If I had to say what was the biggest hurdle, it would 100% be the description. As some might know from [CTA1](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/1), there was an achievement that I made called "Butchering a Name" has a writing style very similar, where I like to write a very long description with the hints sprinkled in it. The problem with that is of course the word soup that might be created, and when the first description draft was submitted, [Sheppsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608) clearly saw that as a problem, and after 4 iterations, the final description was reached, even if [Sheppsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608) thought it was a bit too long, I didn't want to budge anymore, feeling that I would be sacrificing my style. 

So yeah, that was Sound In Motion, once again thanks to [Sheppsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14895608) for giving the idea for and making the slider anchors and [TamamoLover](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7772622) for making the map. I promise the next one will be even better.

### The Everlasting Epigrapher

As the creator of this achievement, I'm certainly biased, but it was definitely my favorite. The idea was initially proposed by [Anonymoose](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11153810) to somehow use the cryptic language in [Yooh - Eternity](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402789#fruits/5211146) for an achievement‚Äîthis being before the translation was revealed. When I got some free time, I decided to try translating the language, and [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) joined in to help me. After an hour, we had a table of symbols to letters (except J and Z, which we're pretty sure were not used anywhere). In the process, [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) had translated the text on all 5 rocks. Come a few days later, I finally had a good idea of how we could use this all in an achievement, and thus **The Everlasting Epigrapher** was born. The CWC team absolutely cooked with this tiebreaker and I think it's pretty cool that we were able to use their little easter egg in an achievement. Like Sound In Motion, this one was also made to be pretty difficult, so well done to the 7 teams that completed it.

### Graphic Design Is My Passion

| Description | Sheppsu's been busy updating the site, so he put me in charge of graphic design. The lineup he gave me looked a bit unfamiliar, but I managed to pull things off with the help of some dark magic. [https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/graphic_2b2d5018fe0cb636.html](https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/graphic_2b2d5018fe0cb636.html) |

[yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) made several puzzle-oriented achievements that were widely loved. It's tough to pick just one to highlight, but this one was among the most favorite. Best of all, you can [try it yourself](https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/graphic_2b2d5018fe0cb636.html)! You can read [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623)'s comment on this one and see the answers [here](https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/solutions_e1529b90acab3664/solutions.html#graphic-design-is-my-passion).

### INSERT COIN

[Dragon20942](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964) made several achievements with interesting wordplay, and **INSERT COIN** was liked by many. I also recommend checking out **Perpertually Anxious** and **Ball Load Error** on the [achievements page](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/2/achievements). I'll let [Dragon20942](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964) take it away from here:

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Dragon20942.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6147964">Dragon20942</a></p>

INSERT COIN was really a team effort, and an achievement that was particularly fun for me because of that. Rather than any one of us solo generating a concept, we iterated between different parties in a way that suited our individual strengths. The final idea felt polished and compelling too! The process went something like this:

1. I floated the idea of the mods spelling something - [Daanny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7183087) had also thought of this
2. I asked about a canonical mod order - [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) found it and also generated a list of possible words we could spell out
3. We brainstormed and found a few words/maps to try (like SODA and DANS)
4. I suggested COIN and Insert Coin mapsets
5. [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) playtested the COIN mod combination
6. [Daanny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7183087) and I tuned the final difficulty/polish:
   - Redundant title/description highlights the idea that there are 2 conceptual "COINs" and the repetition evokes the idea of the prompt flashing on an arcade cabinet
   - COIN should be capitalized since it refers to a mod abbreviation
   - INSERT being capitalized helps further underscore the retro/arcade theming while adding some obfuscation for the idea of COIN referring to mods

Thank you to everyone who took a crack at it - I'm glad people enjoyed :3

This achievement, while having a simple solution, required some out-of-the-box thinking. It's a pretty cool one for the creativity in its solution. Still, it wasn't challenging enough for some, with the first completion being 6 minutes after release and 23 teams completing it!

### Touhosu!

This is one of the nine competition achievements, which were popular for their replayability. No secrets here, just a pretty cool [Necrofantasia map from Luscent](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1881398#fruits/3873376) where you play Touhou in osu!. There were 6 players able to get down to the lowest score of 1 fruit caught (0 doesn't submit), so well played. I'd highly recommend trying the map yourself, even if you've never played catch before. 

## Solutions and more

While that's all for the highlights, there were some other cool achievements that you can find on the [CTA2 achievements page](https://cta.sheppsu.me/iterations/2/achievements) with the solutions available. You can also check out the solutions reveal stream below or [yandax's write up](https://yanda-dy.github.io/cta2-external/solutions_e1529b90acab3664/solutions.html#cta2-yandax) ([yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623)'s achievements only) for more insight on any of them.

I've very thankful to the staff that helped bring this event to life, because making this many achievements of at least decent quality is no easy task. In addition, [yandax](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17465623) and [Alanko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14208558) helped greatly with implementing achievements on the CTA server to reduce bugs and my workload. A full list of staff is available on the [CTA Staff page](https://cta.sheppsu.me/credits). 

I plan to host CTA3 next summer and implement the feedback received from this event, so look forward to that!
