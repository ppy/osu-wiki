Many people underestimate how big of an undertaking preparing a tournament as the osu!mania 4K World Cup really is. Many of the challenges that the pooling team faces are transparent to the end-user. As such, we wanted to interview a few of its most important members to give users a small glimpse into the work that goes behind running the tournament!

[elexire](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9206093) may not be as known as the other members of the pooling team, but their work is nothing short of impressive. Their tournament experiences across multiple community tournaments did not go unnoticed by the rest of map selectors, and as such were added to the team as of last year. Let us get their perspective working as a pooler as they begin to shape the future of osu!mania 4K World Cups to come!

Given your previous experiences, how do you think pooling for MWC differs from other community tournaments? What would you say you've had the most impact in? Lastly, are there any future goals, ambitions, or plans you or the team had in mind for the tournaments yet to come?

I must say, the overall process feels much heavier than any past tournament I've participated in. Possibly because, for the most part, MWC is the only tournament I've taken part in as a map selector, while every other tournament only had me as a mapper. Perhaps the closest thing I can compare it to was the first ever tournament I've helped in, [Speed of Light 3](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2023). With it being my first time helping with tournaments, I ended up doing quite a lot, such as being active in voice calls, and looking at how the entire pooling process went when it came to customizing the maps. I honestly don't think I could've been given a better first experience, I'm seriously thankful for everyone I met through it, and how it is what essentially spiraled me into where I am currently.

To go back to MWC, I find myself having the most impact in more "managerial" matters. Things like communicating with other mappers on where they stand or what they'd like to do, taking note of all slots currently occupied by mappers to prevent overlap, and other simple tasks such as giving a second opinion where needed. It's definitely not too much to look for, but the work allocation is seriously beneficial for all map selectors involved, playtesting managers included.

Personally, my goals moving forward would be to have more versatility, if that makes any sense. This kind of goes back to what I just said, as the range of what I do as a map selector is more focused on making things flow smoother, rather than directly monitoring where certain customs place. This weak spot of mine is definitely something I'd like to improve on for future years, and eventually into other tournaments as well.

Ever since they ranked their first map back in 2022, [V1do-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17527968) has rapidly made a name for themselves across the entire community. As they garnered more experience, they ended up giving tournament mapping a much deserved chance. Lo and behold, their efforts managed to bear fruit as they joined the mapping team in 2024! A true testament to their dedication to the art of mapping and community alike.

As a mapper, what do you find the most interesting about mapping for a specific tournament, let alone one as prestigious as MWC? How was your experience mapping for Qualifiers this year, and how much different was it from bracket stages? As a recent addition yourself, do you have any suggestions for any user whose long term goal is to join the mapping team?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17527968" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/V1do-.jpg')"></a>

To me, tournament mapping has been the most interactive way of communicating between mappers and players. Every single custom map aims to create a challenging yet enjoyable experience for the players. Each tournament is a trove of new treasures, and I find the process of adapting to each unique playerbase very engaging and challenging.

This is no different with the osu!mania 4K World Cup — the pinnacle of all osu!mania tournaments. Your maps will be played by the most skilled and experienced players in this game. Regardless of the extra pressure, having the opportunity to create maps and be appreciated for it by players of this caliber must be the dream of every mapper. Knowing this, I work my hardest to be able to deliver my best maps. In return, I get positive praise that pushes me further in my mapping career, and nothing makes me this happy when mapping for tournaments.

Mapping for Qualifiers has certainly been a new experience for me. They're arguably the most important maps in the entire tournament given they determine the teams' seeds. The extra responsibility forces me to put in extra time refining the map, coordinating with the playtesters, and adhering to the poolers' expectations. Another significant difference is the cohesiveness required in the Qualifiers pool. Balancing difficulty across several different skill sets is no easy task after all. Thanks to our amazing team of poolers and playtesters, we were able to deliver this incredible Qualifier pool for everyone to enjoy!

I'm quite surprised by the amount of emerging mappers seen throughout this year, each one bringing something unique to the mapping scene. Those aiming for a spot in the MWC 4K, my best advice would be to be more active throughout the community. Mapping in multiple community tournaments, actively engaging with the playerbase, actively giving and receiving feedback, or even just actively playing the game. These are all good ways to evolve as a mapper while simultaneously leaving your mark on the community. Not only will this help you keep up with mapping standards, but it will also teach you the importance of pooling in tournaments.

The osu!mania 4K World Cup mapping team have been one of the best teams I've had the pleasure of working with, and I'm looking forward to seeing new faces making their way into the team in years to come!

Two times MWC 4K winner for team USA and playlist winner extraordinaire, [mashu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12028216) has forsaken their right to play for the tournament to become a playtester for the second time in a row! Let us hear their thoughts after having been on both sides of the fence for so long.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/RandomeLoL.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-nat" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063">RandomeLoL</a></p>

The transition from being a player to becoming a playtester must've not been easy. Have you been enjoying your job as a playtester, even if it meant waving away your right to play for the tournament? How important of a task do you think playtesting is when it comes to ensuring the quality of the pools?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12028216" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/mashu.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12028216">mashu</a></p>

Going from the mindset of a player to a playtester was quite a learning experience. As a player, it was more about maximizing scores, staying consistent, and taking note of strong and weak points on our matchups to know where my skill set would best complement my team's play. When I became involved in the process of playtesting, I'd learn that there were aspects of this role that were not very apparent to me beforehand. Coming from a player background, it quickly became one of the biggest hurdles I'd face.

Starting out in this role, just looking at a handful of maps really showed me just how different pooling can be from what I initially expected. It was less about how well and consistently you could perform on these maps, but more about how said map feels in the context of the tournament. Did the difficulty feel right? Does the map fit into its respective slot in its category well? Does it contrast well with other maps in the same category? These were questions we'd have to answer for each single pick that was ran through the team. Despite the challenges, I still found it very enjoyable to be involved in alongside the rest of the team to help bring tournaments like these to life!

As for how important playtesting is, I feel that it was as important as the rest of cogs in the pooling machine. The responsibility for this one gear lies in acting as a player for the tournament while providing feedback in a way that resembles the opinions of those who'll be playing it. This helps to evaluate maps from a plethora of perspectives with differing opinions. This is then used to finetune each single pick in the pool and make any changes accordingly to ensure its quality.

Despite playtesting being just as important as the rest of roles in the team, it is only thanks to everyone's collective efforts — not just the playtesters — that we were able to make these maps as fun and enjoyable as they are, both for players and spectators alike!
