Despite his monochromatic name, **GRYSCL** paints a full-colour picture with sound design alone.

With seven years of experience under his belt, **GRYSCL** knows the ins and outs of electronic music. Beginning with inspiration from gothic hardcore greats like [*Kurokotei*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/58), *Laur*, and [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31), then later transitioning into experimental ranges akin to [*Frums*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/68), [*False Noise*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/52), and [*Silentroom*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/92), **GRYSCL** offers something well beyond your usual rhythm game fare.

Starting today, that sound is officially part of osu! too. **5** tracks are up for grabs on [**GRYSCL**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/492)!

Whether you're looking for inspiration or something to listen to, you'll be satisfied down here:

That's only half of what **GRYSCL** has to offer. The rest can be found on [**GRYSCL**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/492) until the heat death of the universe. ...Or whenever osu!'s servers stop existing. Whichever comes first.

A new Featured Artist is on its way next weekend. Stay tuned.
