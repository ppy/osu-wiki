**100** computers are dedicated to osu! at this event, offering space for:

- **A two-division LAN tournament**
- **Casual circle clicking**
- **Seeing osu! players face-to-face!** 

We'll have mice and keyboards, but feel free to bring your own peripherals too — especially if you're competing! Each computer comes with **osu!(stable)**, **osu!(lazer)**, a bunch of maps, and **OpenTabletDriver** pre-installed.

When you're not clicking circles, you can hang out in a shared community space, or take a seat in stage's audience area to watch the tournament live on the big screen!

## How does the tournament work?

When we say this tournament is open to everyone, we mean *everyone*.

The tournament is split into divisions based on skill level:

- **Division 1** is for the most competitive players. [Register for division 1 here](https://www.start.gg/tournament/the-roundtable-x-lvlup-expo-division-1/details) or in-person!
- **Division 2** is for relatively new players. [Register for division 2 here](https://www.start.gg/tournament/the-roundtable-x-lvlup-expo-division-2/details) or in-person!

**You can (and should!) register for both divisions,** but if you qualify for division 1, you won't be able to participate in division 2.
