Last weekend, 12 teams played in the Semifinals round, but in the end, only 6 remain. At this point in the tournament, every single team still competing is a top contender looking to reach the very last stage of the tournament — and for the most ambitious, even aspiring to win it all in the end. Let's take a look at all that happened in the past week.

The Semifinals mappool was one of the biggest step-ups in difficulty in the tournament so far. It makes sense given the remaining teams, giving us an introduction to late-tournament pools. It started right away with [R.I.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395421#fruits/5188524) (NM1), mapped by [Zyzyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2888013) and [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891), standing at a star rating of 7.95 and featuring intense and stamina-draining patterning for the full three and a half minutes. 

Surprisingly, three mappers made their CWC debut this round: [Cruwev](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12195994), [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462), and [Zileni](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23525574). Cruwev made a bold entrance with their [Big Daddy (Cut ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395283#fruits/5188079) (NM3) map, serving as the gimmick pick of the round. Cruwev's unconventional mapping style mixed with a high circle size and a low approach rate made for one of the biggest standouts in the mappool, both in terms of difficulty and hype factor. 

Phob, a first-time mappooler this edition, debuted not with just one, but two maps this round, those being [Yakujinsama no Couple Dance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395303#fruits/5188114) (HD2), and [Idolize](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395304#fruits/5188115) (DT4). Both maps feature the classic Phob flair, filled with unique ideas and unconventional patterning. And finally, Zileni delivered us [Deglaciation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395287#fruits/5188086) (HR3), a more conventional yet explosive mechanical Hard Rock pick for this round. New custom mappers are a rare sight in the osu!catch scene, so having three fresh faces was a pleasant surprise to see for everyone involved.

This round also featured the first [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) appearances of the year in [Xabon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395292#fruits/5188099) (HD3), as well as [Necrotopia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395391#fruits/5188321) (TB), the latter being a collaboration with [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598). A staple mapper in tournaments over the past few years, the osu!catch legend returns once again for CWC 2025, with each map more unique than the last.

Two weeks ago, the first [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) of the tournament was revealed. Last week, that number increased to two, and for this week... you guessed it: three originals are here!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-11-osucatch-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap/SUTEGORO_Banner.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955)

We started off strong with [SUTEGORO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955) by [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220). Mapped by the Polish duo consisting of [Mniam](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6050530) and [Malai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4863096), this explosive math rock track was done justice with a Hidden pick that caught many players off guard. Reflecting the calculated chaos of the instrumentals, the map combines repeated antiflows, inconsistent spacings, and 1/16 hyperwalks, resulting in a pick that even the strongest teams struggled to keep up with.

Also, be sure to check out the beautiful photography by [Amphy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223), edited by [hourius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298) used for the background art!

It's Touhou Eurobeat time. A fairly uncommon genre in osu!catch, it was a pleasant surprise when [A-One](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/168) was revealed as the artist for one of this week's originals — [Side by Side](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395293#fruits/5188100). The high-octane instrumentals accompanied by the classic A-One vocals combined into an infectious bundle of energy designed to set your fingers — and the floor — on fire. Mapped by [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284) and featured as a Mixed Mod pick, it would end up being a four-minute stamina gauntlet filled with stop-and-go patterns, with barely any breathing room for anyone playing it. 

[Peargor](https://www.youtube.com/@Peargor/videos) made an appearance to work on the illustration for the song and [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) worked on the storyboard, so go check out the map to get the full *Side by Side* experience.

If you've been following the past few news posts, you'll know that [Ice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/484), titan of rhythm game music, [is now a Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-06-29-new-featured-artist-ice). The bombshell was dropped during this round's mappool showcase, revealing the new osu! original [Nostalgia Sonatina Op.3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395334#fruits/5188192) in the process.

Following the previous "Nostalgia Sonatinas" made for other rhythm games, the third entry of the series would be for this CWC, featured as a Mixed Mod map by [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134). It focused mostly on mechanics, with many wiggles and stream patterns for the classic Ice piano melodies. Welcome to the Featured Artist lineup!

As we approach the end of the tournament, less and less matches are to be expected each round. However, it also means that every match is high-stakes, featuring two teams that managed to reach this point in the tournament facing off against each other. Currently, only two teams remain in the winners' bracket, those being last year's grand finalists, the United States and Argentina. Every other team has suffered a loss, and now fights for survival in the losers' bracket.

Several top contenders were eliminated this round, including ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland and ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada, respectively placing third and fourth last year, as well as the ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation, this year's third seed. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia, ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru, and ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan also exited the tournament, falling short of reaching the top 6.

If you missed it, there was also a [staff showmatch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2504289576?t=2h5m10s) featuring some big names in the scene — which ended in an intense tiebreaker. And no, it totally wasn't rigged... despite what you might've heard. It was tons of fun, so feel free to go check it out!

With that being said, let's look at some highlights of the round!

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada

Canada (#12) and the Russian Federation (#3) were two teams with very different runs in the tournament. Canada were sent down to the losers' bracket in the Round of 16 by France, while the Russian Federation placed third in the Qualifiers, and dominated the winners' bracket until encountering Finland, who ended up defeating them thanks to their amazing consistency on the Quarterfinals pool. This Russian roster is arguably the strongest they've ever had, while Canada was trying to remain as strong a competitor as the previous years.

Both rosters were starting to show weaknesses due to the scaling of the mappool this week, but Canada was expected to perform on the gimmicky picks and Hidden, and the Russian Federation on the more mechanical picks. This is exactly what happened in the beginning of the match, with Canada going for [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395319#fruits/5188169), [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395334#fruits/5188192), and [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955) and winning all of them, with a standout FC from ::{ flag=CA }:: [CTBWhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620002) on MM3 with Hard Rock. The Russian Federation followed suit, picking and winning [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395295#fruits/5188102) and [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395286#fruits/5188085).

At this point, both teams were just looking to get a break point to get a lead in the match, and Canada would be the first to get one on what looked like a very solid [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395333#fruits/5188189) pick from the Russian roster. Team Canada knew that they weren't out of picks either — this mappool featured many maps on the more unconventional side which they enjoyed playing around, like they did on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395283#fruits/5188079) next to secure the break point. The Russian Federation won their [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395421#fruits/5188524) gamble, and even managed to win on Hidden against Canada on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395292#fruits/5188099) to get back to an even scoreline.

But in the end, they would fail to win on their own [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395291#fruits/5188098) pick by only about 18k points, letting Canada close out the match 7–5 on [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395304#fruits/5188115). Was it the picking strategy that failed the Russian Federation, a couple too many misses, or just Canada playing great? It looked like a combination of all, but this loss meant that they were now out of the tournament, with the twelfth seed eliminating the third. Unfortunately for Canada, they would also end up being eliminated this round, losing to Chile 7–1. These last few rounds are unforgiving, and with them comes no shortage of broken hopes.

### ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland vs. ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile

Poland (#10) and Chile (#9) last faced off in the losers' bracket Finals of [CWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024), a memorable showdown that ended with Poland winning on the tiebreaker. This year, they would go against each other one round earlier in the same bracket, but with slightly different rosters. Both teams suffered from major player losses going into this edition, and wanted to prove that they were still able to compete with their current lineups. All in all, an exciting showdown between two evenly-matched teams was ahead of us.

After successful first picks on each side, on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395295#fruits/5188102) for Poland and [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955) for Chile, the second picks would end up being break points for the opposing team. [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395421#fruits/5188524) didn't favour Poland as they had hoped, and the very expected [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395292#fruits/5188099) pick coming from Chile would backfire against them despite Poland's supposed Hidden weakness this year. But after that, Poland would once again lose on their own pick, this time on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395286#fruits/5188085), which wasn't the case for Chile who won [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395319#fruits/5188169). 

Poland had lost their edge in the match after two opportunities to keep the scoreline, and it was up to them to make up for it. However, as the match went on, no comeback would be seen from Poland. After barely winning on [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395290#fruits/5188096), they would keep succeeding in their pick strategy by also taking [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395287#fruits/5188086) and [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395293#fruits/5188100). But just managing to win your own picks wouldn't be enough in this situation, as Chile would do the exact same on [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395334#fruits/5188192), [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395333#fruits/5188189), and finally [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395291#fruits/5188098) when the timer ran out for Poland.

Each pick ended up being a nailbiter — would this be the map that Poland comes back on to bring themselves to a tiebreaker? Unfortunately, that moment they were now eliminated of the tournament by Chile, losing 5–7. Chile had now taken their revenge, and thanks to this win and their next one against Canada, they qualified for the Finals round, matching their performance from last year despite losing key players and playing in a more stacked CWC. Can they manage to push even further? Tune in to next week's matches to see!

This week's interviewee is [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462), mappooler for the first time this edition, who also made his debut this round as a mapper. He gives us some insights on his approach to mappooling, and the process for this edition.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

How would you introduce yourself to people not in the know?

Hi, I'm Phob. I'm a Polish osu!catch player and mapper. I've been actively participating or helping out in community projects and events for the past couple years. After placing 3rd in last year's CWC, I've decided to join the mappooling team.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

What does it take to create a good pool for CWC, and how does one evaluate whether a pool is good or not?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Phob.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462">Phob</a></p>

Out of all osu!catch tournaments, CWC is the only one with enough resources to create fully custom-made pools. As a result, good communication between mappers, poolers and testers, along with the ability to provide clear feedback and guidance is crucial in order to make a high quality pool.

Good balancing is arguably the most important, yet also the most difficult part to get right, so it is the first thing that needs to be checked. Before releasing the pool, we ask multiple playtesters to evaluate the maps' difficulty and give their feedback to reduce bias as much as possible. They also let us know whether the maps accurately represent their slots and test the intended skillsets well. Their work this year has been absolutely invaluable and I don't think we would've done so well without them.

To gain a sense of whether we are going in the right direction, we also analyze individual and team scores of players and take their direct feedback into account (given that it's stated clearly and wouldn't introduce any bias).

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

Are there any changes that separate this pool from previous years, or are you sticking to a tried and true formula?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Phob.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462">Phob</a></p>

We didn't introduce any major changes to skill requirements of each slot, but some definitions have been slightly altered as an attempt to better test those skills. Most notably, the HD pool, with maps that now include more non-uniform spacings and unconventional snappings, and the HR pool, featuring maps that don't avoid characteristic note randomization as much as they used to.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

Did your previous experience as a player who reached the podium last year affect your experience as a mappooler?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Phob.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462">Phob</a></p>

Yes. It was the first time I got to experience the tournament as a key player on the Polish team, as well as the first time Poland managed to reach the Grand Finals. Since I had to spend time practicing every single map in every pool, I started to notice more and more issues arising with each round. Poor balancing, underrepresented skillsets, patterning choices that majorly hurt playability for the sake of emphasis or aesthetics (most notably, the infamous "1/8s") - these are the things I focused on preventing this year as much as I could.

We're now down to the **final 6 teams**, each vying for a spot on the podium — save for the already guaranteed top 3 finishers, Argentina and the United States. Every remaining match promises to deliver, and the most intense rounds are just about to begin.

As usual, the [CWC wiki page](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025) will help you know when to tune in to [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) and [osulive_2](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive_2) to follow the action. Make sure to be there!
