[osu!gaming CTF 2025](https://osugaming.sekai.team/) launches this weekend, 25th October, for a 48-hour competition! Whether you've never heard of a CTF before or are a veteran hacker, here's everything you need to know about participating in this unique mishmash.

## What is a CTF?

[Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) are information security exercises where participants solve a series of challenges to find hidden text strings called "flags". Each solved challenge reveals a secret code that, when submitted, earns your team points on a global leaderboard.

In the [Jeopardy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!)-style format used by CTFs, challenges are sorted into various categories, each testing different skills:

| Category | Description |
| --: | :-- |
| **Cryptography** | Break codes, ciphers, and encryption schemes |
| **Web exploitation** | Find vulnerabilities in web applications |
| **Binary exploitation** | Manipulate compiled programs to achieve desired outcomes |
| **Reverse engineering** | Analyse compiled programs to understand their behaviour |
| **Forensics** | Analyse files and data to uncover hidden information |
| **OSINT** | Collect public information to make deductions |
| **Miscellaneous** | Creative challenges that don't fit traditional categories |

If technical puzzle-solving sounds interesting, but you've never participated in one of these yourself, no worries! The challenges are designed to accommodate both beginners and experienced players alike.

## Interesting, but where does osu! come in?

While traditional CTFs feature standard cybersecurity challenges, **every challenge in this event is themed around osu! and/or popular rhythm games**! In addition to the categories mentioned above, we add two more:

- Challenges with the tag **osu!** involve knowledge of the game's ecosystems or interaction with its components.
- Challenges with the tag **rhythm** involve knowledge of other popular (or not so popular) rhythm games or interaction with their game components.

These are the categories where rhythm gamers have the advantage! This means you can definitely gain points just with osu! players in your team, but you'll learn a lot more from each other if your team has expertise from many different areas.

Also, note that none of the solutions involve interacting with online systems (unless they're created by us!), such as public chat/forums or game/website infrastructure, meaning you can use that to narrow down your search... but that's it for general tips! The [event website](https://osugaming.sekai.team/) will contain all the challenges and information you need to get started.

## Competition details

The whole thing spans 48 hours with registration always open — sign up anytime before or during the event:

After the competition ends, participants are encouraged to submit writeups — detailed explanations of how they solved challenges, often including techniques, tools, and creative approaches used. There will even be a writeup competition running for 1 week after the CTF concludes, giving you time to document your solutions in article or video format!

The following prizes will be awarded to the best writeup submissions:

- The authors of the 5 best writeups (as judged by the organisers) will each receive 2 months of [osu!supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/208).
- The best writeup describing an unintended solution to a challenge will receive a [Wacom CTL-472](https://estore.wacom.com/en-us/one-by-wacom-small-ctl472k1a.html) drawing tablet alongside 2 months of [osu!supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/208).
