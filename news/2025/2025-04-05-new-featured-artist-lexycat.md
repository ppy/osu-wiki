**lexycat** crawls out from the depths of the early 2000s internet landscape and into our Featured Artist library!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/468/header.jpg)

Like many osu! players, self-proclaimed cybernetic angel **lexycat** grew up on the internet. Surrounded by digital hearts, zip files, YTPMVs, kitty cats, nightcore girls, dubstep, and VOCALOID, **lexycat** creates music reflective of an online landscape that anyone in the e-age of olde is more than familiar with.

A total of **10** unique tracks are part of [**lexycat**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/468). Pick one of the pre-timed `.osz`s for your next map. Or pick all 10. We won't stop you.
