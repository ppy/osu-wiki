[**Son Goku**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14991975) captured the hearts of **1022** pippi fanatics with a rendition of her glancing over a radiant sky beaming over a snowy lake, featuring a Don who's definitely *chilling* in more ways than one.

### peppy's Picks

You love art, we love art, and so does [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2)! As tradition goes, we brifely pulled osu!'s lead developer away from his osu!(lazer) duties to choose his favourite submissions. Don't worry, triage hell reclaimed him immediately after.

Here's what he had to say about the entries he picked:

<style>
    .news-chat-quote__avatar {
        float: left;
        width: 40px;
        height: 40px;
        border-radius: 50%;
        margin-left: -50px;
    }

    .news-chat-quote__text-container {
        margin-left: 50px;
    }

    .news-chat-quote__username {
        font-weight: 600;
        margin-bottom: 2px;
    }

    .news-chat-quote__colour-ppy {
      color: #3498db;
    }
</style>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-ppy" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">peppy</a></p>

This is one of the cutest fanart entries I've seen in my life. I can't help but smile every time I look at it.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-ppy" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">peppy</a></p>

The team aren't just decorating a Christmas tree, they be decorating a whole forest! Way to go.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-ppy" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">peppy</a></p>

This feels like an everyday scene at a Christmas market in Japan. So cosy.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-ppy" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">peppy</a></p>

Love the postcard vibe and unique art style of this one.

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-ppy" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">peppy</a></p>

We are apparently in solar maxima. So it makes sense that there was no short of six entries featuring aurora lights. This one felt the most magical to me.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/269/banners/Kirb2.jpg)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/269/winners/Kirb2.png)

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/peppy.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-ppy" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976">peppy</a></p>

Simple, but feels like it should be an osu! storyboard. I like gingerbread, what can I say?

As always, many thanks to all the artists who dedicated their time and talent to create these wonderful fanart — you're the lifeblood of this contest.

If you don't see your favourite entry, feel free to [download a zip file containing all entries of the Winter 2025 Fanart Contest here](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/269/Winter2025FanartSubmissions.zip)! If you have [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter), you can drag and drop any image into the game's main menu to set it as the background (by itself — it won't join the others in the rotation).

You'll also find the **top 5 entries** available as [limited-time default profile banners](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-15-aerial-antics-art-results#new-profile-customisations) until the end of the next art contest.
