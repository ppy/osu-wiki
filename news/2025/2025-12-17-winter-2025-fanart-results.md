[**69maow**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2169329)'s cute drawing of the aforementioned mascot impressed a staggering amount of **959** users. Just remember to close down the window, as heating isn't particularly cheap at this time of the year.

### peppy's Picks

You love art, we love art, and so does [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2)! As tradition goes, we brifely pulled osu!'s lead developer away from his osu!(lazer) duties to choose his favourite submissions. Don't worry, triage hell reclaimed him immediately after.

Here's what he had to say about the entries he picked:

<style>
    .news-chat-quote__avatar {
        float: left;
        width: 40px;
        height: 40px;
        border-radius: 50%;
        margin-left: -50px;
    }

    .news-chat-quote__text-container {
        margin-left: 50px;
    }

We are apparently in solar maxima. So it makes sense that there was no short of six entries featuring aurora lights. This one felt the most magical to me.
