osu! has been desperately missing one thing until today: **Tanger**.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/507/header.jpg)

Based in the one and only Ohio, multi-genre producer **Tanger** told us a little about themselves:

> major achievements and milestones
> 
> - im in beat saber
> - im in geometry dash 
> - i cant think of anything else

That list deserves one more bullet point now that **22** tracks are part of [**Tanger**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/507)!

For those who haven't heard **Tanger** before, prepare your ears:

### [Tanger - tiny windows (feat. Frizk)](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/507/tinywindows/Tanger%20-%20tiny%20windows%20(feat.%20Frizk).osz)

The saying "two heads is better than one" doesn't exactly apply to circle clicking, but [ESCRUPULILLO](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18217876) and [uatzap](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16509171) played [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2391171) by [Nagi Seishiro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6300910) in tandem anyway. (And for anyone keeping track, this is the last [COE 2025](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event) clip we have. For now.)

[**Tanger**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/507) has way more tracks to choose from. If you're a mapper, reading this paragraph obligates you to create a map. If you're not a mapper, reading this paragraph hereby grants you the status of mapper. We'll be waiting.

Next weekend? A new Featured Artist. Stay tuned.
