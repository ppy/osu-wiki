As the leaves start to fall and the pumpkin spice wafts through the air, Project Loved brings you some much needed warmth!

Has that summer flu left you forgetting what we do? Don't worry! Project Loved hosts community voting polls every month to decide on beatmaps to be added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps chosen are lovingly selected by the [Loved captains](https://loved.sh/team) of their respective game modes from community suggestions. Each beatmap banner in this news post will direct you to the respective poll and the handcrafted description from a captain. Alternatively, you can view them all directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to vote before it's too late! More information can be found on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and [website](https://loved.sh/).

Feeling that holiday spirit a little early? You too can spread love with Project Loved and can submit maps on our website for our captains to look at, please give it a go and let us know what you'd like to see in the category next!

As always, thank you for voting in the last round, where we celebrated our 8th anniversary! Find the results here:

...but following some nasty tricks, a treat was sure to follow! There's more:

- A new challenger approaches! To help fill the empty shoes left behind, we've enlisted metadata extraordinaire and avid key smasher [kadoen](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12780575) as a coordinator going forward! A little fairy told me you might hear from them in next month's post...

Starting the month off strong, we've got a map you all probably recognize.

PSY – Gentleman is our first *Popular Playcount* pick of October, and "popular" might be an understatement. Mapped by the legendary duo Omni and daph, with a sprinkle of magic from mrekk himself, this map has earned its spot as the "let's nomod this and watch the 1.5x replay like we're Faker" pick of 2025.

Get ready for some literal fullscreen jumps (and that one stream that you'll always fail on) because this catchy banger makes you feel like you've just stepped into a 9★ aim lobby.

No need to drag this out. You know what to do: vote Yes.

Welcome back, Chill Champions!! Well... not really.

This month's second Popular Playcounts pick leans into the emotional side, as aishiteiru- and kelinimo bring on the tears with their take on Cyberpunk's "I Really Want to Stay at Your House". Let the music guide you through a simple yet enchanting track, where the notes seem to dance across your screen — pulling you along, measure by measure, chord by chord.

Sometimes, it's worth stepping away from the skill cap to explore the other experiences osu! has to offer.

Let's vote yes!

This month's Outstanding Oldies, and also my last pick as a Loved captain, is *Hatsune Miku no Shoushitsu (Hommarju Remix)*, mapped by Chocopikel and reuploaded by JappyBabes with permission. And what a map to go out with!

Popularized way back in 2012 with [chocomint](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493)'s legendary plays on it, this is one of the first true "boss maps" of the game, and might be one of the most influential maps of all time for Loved when we think about how many mappers who would years later become staples of the Loved section have been inspired by this map. Get ready for jumps. Lots of jumps. Jumps in all shapes, sizes, and forms. Well, they're mostly geometric, but they're still quite abundant!

I also just want to take this space to say: thank you for the support through the years! I'm extremely grateful for the chance of doing something for the community and I believe I have done my best as a Loved team member, as much as it wasn't always smooth sailing, it was still quite a good experience for me, and I hope I managed to improve the section for everyone. <3

H-HELLO? C-CAN YOU HEAR ME...? IT'S A BIT LOUD, SO MAKE SURE TO TURN DOWN YOUR GAME!

If there's any map you should check out in this month's Project Loved, [blixys](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13015896)' map of [Boris - Akuma No Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2039452#osu/4254108) comes to mind immediately. This Small Spectacles masterpiece isn't just your average map — it's an entire experience, overflowing with raw emotion as blixys sets out to capture the sheer power and aggression that Boris channels through their music.

Promise me you'll at least peek at the map in the editor with beatmap colours enabled and 0% background dim — or watch the YouTube video in the description. You'll see just how far mapping has come. It's maps like this that get me genuinely excited about the future of creative, expressive mapping.

VOTE YES!

This month's Daredevil Difficulties presents a challenge only the bravest of players can conquer. This is [Bal-Sagoth - Shackled To The Trilithon Of Kutulu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312054#osu).

True to the Lovecraftian allusion in its title, this map presents its own kind of horror in the unyielding brutality of its deathstreams. One glance at the number of circles (over 2,300!), Mazzerin fitting them in a song under four minutes long should make that much clear. Originally mapped for OWC 2020, the map had to be nerfed significantly to even fit the difficulty of the pool — the Grand Finals pool at that — but players can try their best on either difficulty here. The set also contains an older rendition created over a decade ago, around the time of such recognizable old-school metal maps like [Apparition](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/216979#osu/690982). And yes, to all those keeping track in the map's comments, I can confirm that this map indeed still firetrucks.

If you think you can escape the grasp of Cthulhu, make sure to vote YES! 🦑🦑🦑

For our *Ranked Rejects* slot, we bring you a set that may restore your belief in the Loved section...

To be honest, no description I can write could possibly sell you on this mapset better than the set itself. Look at the [Depths](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3935174) 7★ top diff... oh my god, it even has a [Kibbleru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3193504)/[Doormat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3230571) Collab Extreme... simply sublime. This set oozes with that simplistic yet all-too-alluring 2016 energy, on top of a classic anime opening that should be instantly recognisable to any player from back in the day. It's a shame this set has sat in the graveyard for over five years now, but I hope you all enjoy this blast from the past!

[fanzhen0019](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/418699)'s map of [DJ TOTTO - Back Spin Sweeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1136709#osu) propels its way into this month's *Gameplay Gimmicks* slot!

fanzhen0019 is no stranger to creating some mind-blowing patterns in their maps, but this one rises well beyond a lot of their works, featuring one-of-a-kind gameplay in the form of "scratch" sliders, requiring you to replay your cursor movements to achieve 300s, as well as numerous other instances of 2B gameplay that are out of this world.

These elements of gameplay are akin to the [original beatmania IIDX chart of this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5btdrQ25E). The chart features a barrage of continuous scratches that require you to continuously spin the turntable while hitting numerous notes simultaneously, which was flawlessly transferred over to osu! in an absolutely genius way.

If you would like to see this map gain a leaderboard to allow players from all backgrounds to have a crack at this map, make your voice heard by voting Yes!

This song, featured in countless edits of videos of spinning and the like occurring, has a very simple yet groovy map to partner with. Many circular patterns and overlaps manifest in this difficulty, which, when given some attempts, are extremely satisfying to hit in runs.

Despite the simple premise, the number of clips that have circulated across the community of the chorus is definitely something to take note of, which is why I implore everyone to finally let this map into the spotlight and to choose "Yes" on the Project Loved voting page!

Previously on Project Loved, Sousei no Aquarion barely failed the Loved voting in 2018. Now 7 years later, and with the beatmap as finished as it will ever be, let's try this one more time. May this clip farm map spread its wings in the current clip farm era.

You have 20 seconds to vote yes or you will be cursed with 1000 years of missing every spaced stream.

Straight from OWC '23, fooders and funny deliver a masterclass in awkward aim with their map of wowaka – Toosenbo. This first wildcard pick of the month pulls no punches — the constant off-angle jumps and dense rhythms will keep you on edge from start to finish as you try to follow in [xootynator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3717598)'s footsteps. Every section demands control, precision, and a little bit of stubbornness to push through.

This month's second *Wildcard* is the perfect way to get into the autumn spirit.

*Yozakura* has both song and mapper working in tandem to provide an experience that's all at once engaging yet relaxing, and tricky yet simple. The occasional odd pattern keeps even experienced players on their toes, but this package on the whole gleams with passion. It's akin to a shower after a long day out, letting the 🎶 notes 🎶 pass you by like the stream from the shower head. I implore everyone to give this map a try after a long session and let yourself be transported to the world this map constructs for the player.

If you earnestly took the advice above, it should be all the convincing you need to vote Yes.

[Faputa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/845733) has been a mapping inspiration within the Chinese-speaking osu!taiko communities, and [Yesod (litmus\* + Rabbit House + A. Ki) - Amenemhat](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1208672#taiko) is just another masterpiece made by the man himself.

This map was used in [Squad Global Taiko Showdown 2023](https://gtsosu.com/2023/sgts/home) as the qualifier's no mod 2 slot, focusing on different snapping changes and SV reading. Being a map for qualifiers, this was the perfect "wildcard" map for the round, and it gained a lot of popularity within and outside of the tournament. Hopefully putting this map up for Loved status would stir up people's memories of this map, and the times where osu!taiko tournament hype reached its peak!

If you agree, be sure to give this map a "Yes" vote!

Playing taiko in tandem has been a hot community topic for quite some time now. Maybe, one player should take care of dons while the other handles the kats? But what if there was a simpler way?

[Raphalge](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650), alongside with [overdahedge2015](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9864847) and [roufou](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1109122), have carefully crafted a map pack specifically designed for Tag play.

You got it! This pack includes loads of difficulties that are accessible to most of the player base. Are you an Oni enjoyer or are 7★ maps more like it? It doesn't matter! Perhaps, the hardest thing about playing Tag might be finding a willing friend!

Although Tag is disabled on taiko by default, here is a short tutorial to show how you can play.

Step 1: Select the Tag co-op Team Mode in a multiplayer lobby.\
Step 2: Whenever you are ready, type `!mp start 5` to start the beatmap.

So, are you ready to take on [Raph's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3918650) Tag gauntlet? Cast your votes and start creating those multis!

[9_9](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7700831), a name seemingly forgotten from the community, has been brought up in this month's Loved nomination. [The Witch Hunt](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1690950#taiko), by none other than one of the G.O.A.T. Featured Artists [takehirotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794), was a mapset intended to go for Ranked, but due to the mapper's inactivity, Ranked status was not achieved.

However, the popularity this map received from the masses is too significant to be ignored. [9_9](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7700831) was able to provide 304 BPM difficulties that are engaging for all skill levels, while also keeping the top difficulty filled with challenges. Not only did the finisher sections feel super fun to play, but the speed sections' patterns are also a blast to play, which will surely encourage players of different levels to try this map out.

This month, I introduce [technoplanet - Fly Like You (Long Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1122790#taiko/2404366)!

This speed map was mapped by [\_Kan2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7160196), widely recognised as both a tournament player and top ranking player, and offers diverse perspectives to enjoy within a single mapset.

At first glance, it appears to be a simple speedmap, but as it progresses, the BPM and SV shifts make it extremely difficult to achieve high accuracy. It can also be played as an anti-mod map, requiring high skill to play with HD mod...

Additionally, this mapset includes a short version, mapped with a different style than the long version, allowing you to enjoy the same song in a different way!

Can you get an S-rank on both maps? Vote "Yes" and play now!

When you want to play an interesting map that is different from what you are used to, you can count on [Madoka Ayukawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1595221) to deliver. Their map [Kinjirareta Asobi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2048344#fruits/5083530) is no exception.

It is always nice to see mappers making good low AR maps that don't have low AR just for the sake of having it. The mapping goes very well with the AR. You have to really get your timings on point for some of these patterns or else you are going to miss. The difficulty picks up at the end so be prepared. This map was mapped for the HD pool of a tournament, [CICO2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1777079), so it isn't too hard to pass without any mods. The challenge comes when adding HD or any other difficulty increasing mods.

The mapset comes with two versions of the same diff: One that is from 2023 and a new, revamped one from this year. The new version feels different enough from the old one so it is not redundant at all. You might not be missing out playing only one version but if you like it maybe give both versions a shot.

[Calameme Fortune](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/706397#fruits), an insanely fun masterpiece by [Kukkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7811952), is a wild mashup that blends iconic osu! songs and memes, all built around [Calamity Fortune](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/114741#fruits/344892) as its base track. Originally made in 2017, it was hugely popular a few years back — and it's now looking for a well-deserved comeback!

In this map, you'll find unique and creative left–right patterns (some more typical and others which will test your consistency), hyperwalks, non-stop action, and most importantly — a lot of fun!

*description written by [Realmaas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6567640)*

October and its autumnal tranquility. Warm colors start replacing the summer greens, painting the world in hues of amber and gold. The change is accompanied by the soft scent of fallen leaves, breathing one last life before their winter slumber.

Everything seems peaceful. The usual.

But... something feels wrong. As time passes, the stillness of the surrounding nature no longer inspires change, but quiet unease. The whisper of the trees born of seasonal wind comes to a halt, as if the world itself held its breath. A feeling of dread grows stronger within you each passing day, a feeling that something that defies your comprehension is coming.

Suddenly, an explosion. Small fruits start falling from the sky in irregular rhythms, slower than gravity would allow, all arranged in a strangely firm structure despite the chaos.

Somewhere, far beyond anyone's reach, [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811) watches the balance of the world crumble, just as intended. The depths of the world stir, to make place for the ascension of the entity. Neither god nor demon, but carrying the weight of both.

Yet, it is not fear that consumes you, but resolve.

For only the mightiest may tame the [World Ender](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2007969#fruits/4176817).

[Laur - DANGEROOOOUS JUNGLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842680#mania) by [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309)\
160 BPM, 2:11 | 4.07★, 4.07★\
*description written by [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479)*

So why is the description of [DANGEROOOOUS JUNGLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842680#mania) "ok zoomer"?

Let's go back to the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_4K) Finals. It was the first year that MWC SV mappools were entirely custom-mapped! [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309)'s [DANGEROOOOUS JUNGLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842680#mania) stood as one of those entries. Its counterpart in the Finals stage was [my own map of *my culture*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842662#mania/3784864), which states "ok boomer" in its description.

It's not really a secret that I'm an old person. Well, relatively speaking anyway, I think in your 30s you are still fairly young. I do not actually know Ciel's age, but going from vibes, I'd say the "zoomer" handle fits them well, at least in spirit. We always love young spirits, even if just at heart. However, what I think is really funny is that I'm not the veteran in this situation. I had only really started mapping SV somewhat recently at the time, towards 2021. Ciel, in contrast, stands as one of those legendary names that every SV player, old and new, has heard of. Their portfolio includes maps such as the incredibly iconic and meta defining [lost found melody](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1051052), the very whimsical and challenging [Shakunetsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/853414), or a map so daunting it had to be nerfed for tournament conditions: [true DJ MAG top ranker's song Zenpen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569250).

[DANGEROOOOUS JUNGLE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1842680#mania) puts the "zoom" in "zoomer". Between really aggressive speedups and ruthless patterning, it doesn't pull any punches and requires quite some practice and studying to get right. Adding onto the [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309) Loved collection, this entry is not going to be out of place in terms of difficulty at all, and will surely satiate the hunger of late-game SV leaderboard hunters.

Are you a boomer, or are you a zoomer? Unlike real life, there's no age requirement or limit to put your vote in, so do not hesitate.

*description written by [LivelyPeninsula](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11517895)*

[Zia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7979303) is notorious for creating rice charts of varying patterns, and [#2wise4u](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1629611#mania) certainly is no exception to that.

With jumpstreams as its main focus throughout the entire chart, [#2wise4u](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1629611#mania) requires you to remain focused, ensuring that you do not lose control. Additionally, some rolls are also present, especially at the beginning, and also the final patterns, which can potentially ruin your accuracy and consistency immediately.

However, the main thing about this chart is that it requires a lot of one-hand trilling fundamentals, as it throws a lot of anchors, and not to mention, there are certain moments where handstream patterns appear, albeit only for very short moments. Jumptrilling is also a key skill that you need to play well, as there are a lot of them in this chart.

It would be beneficial to be proficient at all the patterns mentioned above, though if not, then this chart is still perfect for training these. At 200 BPM, this can be comfortable for most tournament players who have at least reached the 4 digit rank, and there's also higher rates of this chart, reaching up to 280 BPM without DT.

Do you want to see if your fundamentals are good enough for the world stage? Maybe you just want to train yourself and get more proficient at the jumpstream category? Then I think it would be... wise for you to vote "YES" for this to get in Loved!

[DourGent](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4630371) is a rather old name in the community, and it's very likely you've heard the name if you've ever played Etterna in the past, especially if you've played the [exact pack this is from](https://etternaonline.com/packs/3417). Currently, they go by Samctuary and/or [Martzi](https://community.etternaonline.com/u/martzi), and today [Chordial Blitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/809684#mania/1703310), featuring charts from Scintill, Sheenoboo, and [Windoze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7608803) is getting a chance at being Loved!

As the name implies, everything in this pack is, well, chordjacks. Even then, the approach to some of these songs will come as a surprise to many, as quite a few of these have sections that contain different patterns entirely; not exactly what you'd find from the modern "typical" chordjack charts that dominate both the Ranked and Graveyard sections today. This pack also contains quite a selection when it comes to difficulty range, starting at 2 stars, and ending at over 6 stars.

Perhaps there wasn't much need to explain the pack, given its already high popularity off-platform. So, under that assumption, go vote in the thread!

[Good Kid](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/240) is a band that stands by its name. They're perhaps known as one of the most famous bands to have [raised voices towards song usage within content creation](https://x.com/goodkidband/status/1972752482519695463). Good Kid, in fact, encourages us to use their music for YouTube, Twitch and many other fair use scenarios... like osu!. Coming from the Clone Hero community, where indie music and content creation have been positively developing over the years, it always warms my heart seeing many different people contributing to the collective bank of content that we can enjoy right now, on our computers and various devices.

But I digress. As a Loved entry, [Aloe Lite](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1304568#mania) stands as a really cute, mid difficulty dump technical file. I use the term "file" deliberately, as its technical style is pretty in line with what players from other mania-centric games enjoy. Said style has had its interest growing over the years, with more than just a few mappers drawing inspiration from [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082), who has been known and recognised as perhaps one of the main paragons of the style itself.

[lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052). That's it. That's the post. You already know what to expect.

[Boxel Adventure](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1941136#mania/4014332) was made for the [Speed of Light 3](/wiki/Tournaments/SOL/2023) Finals mappool, which then later found itself being used in the Grand Finals mappool in [4K MWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_4K) on 1.05x rate, primarily for the extremely jack-and-shield-heavy nature it holds as a hybrid.

As established, a chart by lemonguy will do anything but... be normal. Maybe it's something about his hybrids in particular that no other person can recreate, but *Boxel Adventure* has gotten quite the audience for being absurdly challenging, with its usage of very awkward bursts that play a part in making the 195 BPM shields so much harder to hit than any experienced player would initially expect (as if the BPM alone wasn't enough to already catch most players slipping up constantly).

It's not often Loved sees hybrids, especially of this difficulty, so it's heavily recommended to put your vote in and give players something to truly suffer with!

\[[Crz\]FolAH1217](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6232458) makes a lot of Long Note (LN) charts that are widely used in tournaments today, with a lot of them even showing up in the osu!mania World Cup. [Raindrop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1701983#mania/3477685) is another one of their charts that showcases their charting ability for LNs, and was featured in the Round of 16 mappool for the [osu!mania 4K Chinese National Cup 2022 edition](/wiki/Tournaments/MCNC/4K2022#round-of-16).

At the very beginning, you are already given hints of both density and release elements being present, making this a mixed LN pick. This makes for a really difficult challenge all around, as density typically is one of the more straightforward patterns; however, the moment you place release elements into it, another layer of focus is required in order for you to play this chart accurately. Not to mention, the presence of minijacks all throughout also means that there's a consistency aspect, because these patterns can easily make your hands unstable, and require a lot of practice to hit them while still maintaining your accuracy and control.

While there are break sections that are present in this chart, some LNs are still in there, meaning you REALLY need to keep your focus even when you get some breathing room. With a mix of LN release, density, and minijacks, you are in a test of your consistency, accuracy, and mental fortitude, pushing you to the limits when it comes to your LN tournament fundamentals.

I wouldn't be surprised to see this chart in more tournaments. And hey, if you want a more difficult challenge, there are rates up to 1.4x, in which the physical demand also increases alongside the skillsets mentioned before.

Honestly, I can't wait to see how every player performs in this chart. If you agree, go give this a "Yes" vote and let your voice be heard!

It's rare to see a collaboration between [Muses](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9705896) and [Ruka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6117525) as both are highly skilled charters with years of experience creating high-level 7K maps. Their charts, notably influenced by O2Jam-style mapping, are known for their clean structure and refined execution, showcasing their ability to incorporate diverse variations while maintaining consistent flow, musicality, and comfortable patterns throughout.

For this occasion, we've selected [Kessoku Band – Karakara](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1937441#mania/4004915) as our LN pick of the month, and it's a very high-level one at that (estimated around Azimuth level). The chart's signature features include numerous shield patterns within dense LN sections, tight releases, inverse LN, frequent bursts, and mini 1/8 LNs that demand precise timing. In essence, it tests every aspect of your skillset and your accuracy will drop quickly if you rely solely on your raw skillset alone.

This marks Muses's first entry into the Loved section, and we'd like to use this opportunity to introduce his work to the community and highlight his capabilities at this level of charting. Please show your support for him as he embarks on his journey with his very first Loved map!

Smooth flow.\
Comfortable structure.\
Noodle.

This is probably a very popular pick for those new to LN. Introducing [Leeju](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18219603)'s [8bit Voyager](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1656843#mania/3381798)!

When lacking deep LN skills, many other LN categories can sometimes frustrate players. LN with a moderate BPM, not too high density, rolly patterns, and a flow that isn't overly tricky might just help you overcome your slump. That said, never underestimate it, because LN accuracy is always more challenging than you think. It seems all these elements combined led to its use as the LN Density map for the [MWC 7K 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2022_7K) Quarterfinals.

We believe Leeju deserves another spotlight in the Loved section with this map, so if you agree, go ahead and vote for it!
