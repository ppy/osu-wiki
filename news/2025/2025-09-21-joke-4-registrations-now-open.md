Only one button required?! That's right, the largest 1-key competition is back again for another year of shenanigans and tomfoolery!

[Jaye's One Key Event 4](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2131047), or JOKE for short, is an open-rank 1v1 osu!mania tournament. Easy to learn but hard to master — the tournament is open to anybody, no matter what rank or game mode you play!

## Is this a JOKE?

[Jaye's One Key Event](/wiki/Tournaments/JOKE) is a community for low-key osu!mania (1K–3K) players and mappers, spearheaded by [Jaye](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4841352) and cohosted by [Sparxe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5750235) and [Sydosys](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17523947). Across 1v1 tournaments, country-based team tournaments, dan courses and even an ARG, the JOKE series has seen many goofy and hype moments, and this year will prove to be no different!

## What to expect

Ever since the beginning, all charts used for our tournaments and other related projects have been custom-mapped. Since 2021, we have been on a quest to shine light on as many Featured Artists as possible, currently having over 180 Featured Artists represented throughout. And this year will be no different! Everything will once again be 100% custom-mapped and straight from our beloved Featured Artist catalogue!

But it doesn't stop there! We have also brought on the talent of many musicians over the years to create new content for our projects, having clocked in over 20 to date. Feel free to check out some of our favourites from our more recent events: [One Key World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/JOKE/1KWC_2025) (1KWC) and [One Key Dan Course](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2234187) by JOKE.

You may have also unknowingly come across some of our other works featured in other rhythm games, like the ever popular *1KARUGA* making an appearance in the Adofai World Cup 2023, and *TETRΛTONE ΛLTiSSiMO* as seen above having a showing in Ravon.
