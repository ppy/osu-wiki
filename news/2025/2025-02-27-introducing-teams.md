These are not "clans", they're not "subdivisions", nor are they "guilds" — they are **teams**! And they're here to stay.

It's time for a [15-year-old feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/29780) to see reality. This feature which was once requested by [[Sean]](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/202721) 14 years, 9 months and 10 days before it would be implemented, ended up amassing a total star priority of **+11,744** over the years. An idea which was widely supported by the community up to this day has finally come into fruition!

Despite how many years have passed since the inception of the idea, the core goals of the feature remain the same: to grow and nurture osu!'s many, scattered sub-communities. Users can find new ways to engage with other like-minded members with many of the new features to come. We always knew this was a community game, but this feature will make this aspect ever so slightly more prevalent!

## What's new

The [last osu!(lazer) update](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-02-20-osulazer-updates-february-20-2025) introduced a new "teams" feature. This is a new way for the community to express shared interests and proudly display groups they are part of.

Teams are shown beside usernames in places like user profiles, leaderboards, and forums. Each team gets a flag and name to display everywhere, a unique acronym to go along with it, a banner and description, and their own internal leaderboard.

Users can interact with all of these features by going to the ["My Team"](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams/create) page at any time. Players not yet in a team will be given the option to create one. Alternatively, by going to the page of an existing team, users will be able to apply to any team they see fit!

### Current features

While the feature is still in its infancy, there are plenty of things users can already do with teams:

- Create and join other users' teams.
- Manage incoming applications.
- Compete with your peers on the team's leaderboard.
- Communicate with your team in a private chat room.
- Proudly display your allegiance with a team flag and unique acronym!

### Upcoming features

You can expect to see more features in the future as the system is refined. While there may be more to come, these are a few of the things to look forward to:

- A listing on the website with all available teams in the platform.
- Displaying team leaderboards in osu!(lazer).
- [osu!api (v2)](https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html) support for teams.

### Limitations

- Team acronyms are unique.
- Both team acronyms and names are permanent (contact [support](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) or recreate your team if you make a mistake!).
- Team leaders cannot be swapped.
- The maximum team size is dependent on the amount of [osu!supporters](/wiki/osu!supporter) on the team.
  - Each supporter will add 4 slots to the base team size of 8, up to a cap of 256.
- Users can only join one team at a time.
  - To join another team, you may do so at any time by leaving your current one.

Some of these limitations may be lifted as the system is iterated upon, a lot of which may depend on the community's feedback. Don't be afraid to propose and discuss changes in the [osu!web GitHub repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues?q=is:issue%20state:open%20teams%20label:area:team)!

## Stats

It's hard to put into perspective how much the community has grown to love teams ever since their release, despite their recency. Let's see if numbers will help with that!

Here are some of the most noteworthy stats:

- **7,248 teams** were made during the first 7 days. Close to 1,000 teams per day!
- Currently, only one team has reached the maximum team size of **256 members**, that being [yuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams/14) with a team ID of 14.
- **2,743 teams** only have one member, i.e. the creator. You can show these users some love by joining their team!
- The first team was created all the way back in **December 13th, 2024**. Talk about early access.

While in the developers' own words this is not meant to be a complex system, its addition will add an extra layer of interaction between community members. So, what are you waiting for? Gather your buddies up and create your own team today!
