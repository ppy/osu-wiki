It's that time of the year once again. Prepare your banners, warm up your fingers, and get ready to cheer for your country as we unveil the 16th edition of the osu! World Cup!

This year, we're shaking things up. For the first time ever in an osu! World Cup, the bracket will be expanded to **40 countries** in a brand new format designed to bring more teams into the fold and make early rounds more exciting than ever. To that end, we've also brought back the Group Stage (with a twist). 

Don't just take our word for it – see for yourself:

## Format changes

While the tournament still features the classic Qualifier stage, the path forward for all teams has changed drastically. Instead of the usual 32 teams, there are **40 seeds** up for grabs – but there's a catch. The 40 qualifying teams will be divided into three distinct tiers:

- **Legends (Seeds 1–8):** The absolute best from the Qualifiers. These teams will receive a bye, skipping the group stage altogether and advancing directly to the Round of 16 winners bracket.
- **Challengers (Seeds 9–24):** This group will feature 16 teams, all advancing to the Round of 16 (either winners or losers bracket). This group will feature 16 teams competing for eight winners bracket spots, with the bottom eight finishers being relegated to the losers bracket instead.
- **Contenders (Seeds 25–40):** The final 16 teams, the Contenders will have to prove their skills in order to earn their spot in the bracket stage.

Replacing the Round of 32, the Group Stage is back and will now take place over **two weeks**. The **Challenger** and **Contender** teams will be drafted into their own separate groups of four, with each team playing 3 matches in a classic Round Robin format. This new system is designed to create closer, fairer matches, ensuring that every team that qualifies gets to experience the competition for as long as possible.

Team placements after three group stage matches will determine their final seeding:

- **For Challengers**, all 16 teams advance. The top 2 from each group move into the Winners Bracket, while the bottom 2 drop to the Losers Bracket.
- **For Contenders**, the stakes are higher. Only the top 2 from each group will advance, moving directly into the Losers Bracket, while the bottom two are eliminated.

This culminates in a familiar Round of 16 structure, where the 8 Legends will face the top 8 Challengers, and the bottom 8 Challengers will take on the top 8 Contenders. 

As always, for more details on this (and more!), please refer to the **[osu! World Cup 2025 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025)**. For this year in specific, we urge you to check the [Group stage instructions](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2025#group-stage-instructions) section, as it details how the group stage will work in full.
