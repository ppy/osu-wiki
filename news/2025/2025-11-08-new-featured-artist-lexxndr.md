Self-taught composer **lexxndr** has been constructing their own form of jungle, drum & bass, and breakcore for the past 4 years. They've been influenced by the likes of [*Sewerslvt / Cynthoni*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/169), *DM DOKURO*, *Rory in early 20s*, and even a bit of osu! via exposure to a variety of artists. As of today, **lexxndr** is joining osu!'s Featured Artists, and might influence another aspiring artist years down the line!

A grand total of **25** songs have wandered into [**lexxndr**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/510). And they're not leaving.

When listening through previews for these Featured Artist announcements, it's always best to start from the beginning:
