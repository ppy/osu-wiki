As it has been 3 years since the last edition, here's a refresher on what EGTS, GTS' flagship tournament, is about. Since 2021, the tournament has strived to provide entirely custom-made mappools complemented by original designs and songs, working towards adding even cooler things with every iteration: this time around, get ready for official rhythm game collaborations, including [Phigros](https://twitter.com/Phigros_PGS), [vivid/stasis](https://twitter.com/hajimeli_vs) and more! We are not planning on slowing down anytime soon. Look forward to this final run.

We will also bring a staple from our rank-restricted GTS tournaments to EGTS, being our All-Stars showmatch, taking place on the Grand Finals weekend before the matches! This is a 4v4 showdown between 12 chosen players placed in two teams of 6. While other All-Stars participants were determined with a popularity vote, this is EGTS, which means the top 12 players by placement in the bracket will be directly invited!

Regarding the tournament's format, two changes are to be noted: instead of 96 players making it to a double-elimination bracket like in 2022, only the top **64 players** following a qualifier round will square off for glory. Mappool-wise, all songs used in the tournament will either come **from the Featured Artist listing**, or are **used with permission from the artist**.

The tournament's detailed schedule and all relevant info for participating can be found below.

## Original content

As we've stated earlier, EGTS releases a lot of original content through a variety of mediums. One the main ones, however, has been our story, which has been shown through short videos before the reveals of all past EGTS tiebreaker original songs, as well as the [COEGTS 2023 mappool showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I3UH7Al-lM).

We're now reaching the end of that story coming in EGTS, so we've wanted to gift you a little something, with the first ever full-length MV we've made, and basically our ending theme.
