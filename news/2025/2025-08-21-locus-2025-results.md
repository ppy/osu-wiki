Following a nail-biting 15 days of voting, the winners of Locus 2025 have finally been decided!

![](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025/img/banner.jpg)

In case you're new here, Locus was a multi-layered contest [launched in early 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-31-locus) to bring the creative circles on osu! closer together.

Participants formed teams of up to 5 members to produce an "original beatmap experience", which consisted of:

- An original song of length 1:30 - 3:00
- A full beatmap spread on the osu! game mode that satisfies the ranking criteria
- Visual assets (e.g. background/storyboarding/video)

In addition, teams had to remain anonymous throughout the duration of the contest.

After 6 months of participants working behind closed doors, the entries were unveiled to the public to be evaluated over an intense 2 week voting phase. The votes were then fed into a [new Elo voting system](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-08-01-locus-2025-voting-open#the-elo-rating-system) to determine the rankings of the entries.

With the dust now settled, we are proud to recap the outcome of osu!'s most ambitious contest yet!

## Livestream showcase

On August 17, we hosted a Twitch livestream to showcase all 42 entries in a countdown towards the winners of the contest. If you missed it, you can watch the full VOD below, featuring commentary from [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718), [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079), and [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983).

It's a 2.5-hour marathon of a video, so grab some popcorn and sit back to experience the work painstakingly crafted by the wide pool of talented individuals our community has to offer.

## Statistics

First of all, we got **934 community votes**! For a contest that required voters to play 5 maps, this seems pretty sizeable, even though it didn't quite reach the nice round 1,000.

We saved some data during the voting phase to see how the voting turned out. As expected, many people voted at the start with fewer votes trickling in at the end:

Also, since voting worked by selecting a difficulty level to judge (for the mapping category), we have data on which difficulties people chose to play:

## Results

After two weeks of voting, these are your winners for Locus 2025!

The top entries have earned equal prizes:

- The entry will be bundled as part of the default osu! installation as "recommended beatmaps" until the conclusion of the next iteration of the contest
- Team members have been awarded **Architect** titles based on the role they played in this contest: *Visual Architect*, *Musical Architect* or *Mapping Architect*
- Team members will receive a unique profile badge themed around their entry (awarded when the maps are ranked)

As a special mention, peppy also had the liberty of picking an entry to receive a wildcard prize:

This "extra" wildcard prize was revealed on stream to be the following:

- The entry will also become a bundled map like the top 5
- [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2), the creator of the game, favourites the beatmap

For the remaining entries, team members are also eligible for a badge if they are able to rank the set before the conclusion of the next iteration of the contest (with some additional stipulations).

Lastly, an [osu!(lazer) playlist](https://osu.ppy.sh/multiplayer/rooms/1539920) was created with all 199 difficulties that were submitted in this contest. At the top was ::{ flag=US }:: [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929) with a 13-million score gap and the only performance of 99% overall accuracy! As a result, they've received a fancy "Locus playlist leader" badge.

## Conclusion

What a wonderful time it has been. The scale of our contest reached a scope that exceeded any of our initial projections. We join the participants in a shared celebration of the many successes and triumphs we have seen over the past 6 months.

However, we acknowledge there were operational oversights and shortcomings during the contest, which may have left a sour impression for a number of people. It's been a humbling experience for the team, and we've got a lot to learn and address before we move on to hosting the next iteration of the contest.

We've created a [feedback form](https://form-auth.ppy.sh/form/2025-locus-feedback) to aid in this process, and we aim to post a post-mortem document on the `#osu-locus` Discord channel on how we intend on moving forward with the contest in the future.

**Further announcements for the contest will be coordinated through the `#osu-locus` channel on the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy).**

If there were credits at the end of this contest, we bet it'd list everyone involved. Actually, that's exactly what we have right below:

Thank you for being a part of the first step in what we hope to be a recurring event that people will look forward to every year!
