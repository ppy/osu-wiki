If you were tasked with listing the most legendary composers in the rhythm game scene, you'd find yourself writing down "**Memme**" sooner than later.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/518/header.jpg)

Crafting classics since the 2000s, **Memme** is a South Korean producer whose works have been featured widely across the music game spectrum. While most titles only feature one or two of **Memme**'s tracks, *O2Jam* stands out as the exception: the majority of **Memme**'s rhythm game music (especially those recognisable by osu! players) were composed specifically for the *O2Jam* series.

And so we're bringing those iconic tracks to osu!.

Scour through all **19** available tracks on [**Memme**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/518), each pre-timed as the foundation for your next beatmap.

We'd confidently bet that you've played some of these maps before, but that doesn't mean you can't play them again. Relive memories or make new ones with everything our last Featured Artist of the year has to offer:

Congrats, you made it. Give your scroll wheel a break, or head to [**Memme**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/518) and start from the top.

That's all for 2025's Featured Artists! A grand total of **64** musicians made their way into osu!'s Featured Artist library this year. That's a lot of music.

Thanks for keeping your ears peeled for everything from these weekly artist announcements to the outstanding efforts showcased in our World Cups' [original song productions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIYfYZCsR-6HxVFIqAq6S19ntngP3XT9t). It's not going to be easy to top what was accomplished this year, but rest assured: *much more* hype music is on the horizon for osu!.

There's infinitely more we can spoil, but we'll leave it at that for now.

As always, stay tuned.
