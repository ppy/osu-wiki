It's been a little over two months since we first announced Locus. Though the contest is far from over, we have many exciting updates for you!

In case you missed the [announcement post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-31-locus) or have forgotten, Locus is a multi-layered contest launched in early 2025 to bring the creative circles on osu! closer together.

So far, we've received registrations from over 200 individuals making up around 60 teams. This number has already exceeded our wildest expectations, and more registrations seem to be coming in every week! It brings us great joy to see our contest foster excitement in our community, and to admire people united in their passion and enthusiasm towards creating something special.

Registrations will continue to remain open until the submission deadline of 1 June 2025. If you are interested in participating or have not yet registered a team, we highly recommend you read the [wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Locus/2025) for more details.

While participants have been busy "cliquing" their circles, the Locus team has tirelessly been working behind the scenes on a series of relevant side projects.

### Trial voting

On 16 March, we unveiled the *trial voting* — a demonstration of the community voting system to be used in Locus. The main goal of the trial is to increase transparency on how our voting system works, and to show that it was capable of generating agreeable results.

For this trial, we asked the question:

> What was the best osu! original tiebreaker from the osu! World Cups?

Here are current standings for the top 5 entries:

The voting will remain open until the next news post update, so head over to the [trial voting website](https://locus.yui.tv/) to cast your vote now if you haven't already! For feedback, please use the `#osu-locus` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy). Your input is very much appreciated!

Many thanks to [Venix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631), [Komm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7671790), and [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079) for their efforts in developing this website.

### Teaser #1

On 23 March, we sent an email to all registered teams to provide a short video (of their choice) to tease part of their entry. Only 10 or so teams were able to provide us with any usable footage, but what we received was extremely exciting. See for yourself below:

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <video width="95%" controls>
        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/2025-04-13-locus-teaser.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

We look forward to receiving further updates from the entries featured above, and we hope this video will encourage more teams to submit something for teaser #2 (which has a deadline of 1 May). There are only 7 weeks to go!

Many thanks to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) who cut out over 60% of the footage that was submitted, may he be more gracious for the next video.

### Demo entry: cygnus - Metamorphism

Before we even announced the contest, members of the Locus team decided it would be a good idea to create a "demo entry", even though we weren't exactly sure what purpose it would have fulfilled at the time.

Ultimately, we felt it would be useful as a general reference. We made a short video documenting the creative process behind our entry, and we would like to encourage other teams to do something similar!

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

        <source src="https://assets.ppy.sh/media/news/2025-04-13-locus-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="none">
    </video>
</div>

You can download this demo entry [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2354848#osu/5070094). Note that it will not be competing in the actual Locus contest.

Many thanks to [Matrix](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5052899) for coordinating this.

That's it from us for now! Please stay tuned for further updates — our next news post will aim to cover teaser #2 and provide instructions for submitting your Locus entry, among other things.

**Announcements for the contest will be coordinated through the `#osu-locus` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy).**
