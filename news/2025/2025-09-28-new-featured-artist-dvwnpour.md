From the skies to our Featured Artist catalogue, **Dvwnpour** is here.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/503/header.jpg)

**Dvwnpour** has more inspirations than two hands can count, ranging from specific artists like [*Boxplot*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/154), [*Rameses B*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/270), *Snail's House*, [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31), [*Silentroom*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/92), *Virtual Riot*, [*Sylvir*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/8), *Madeon*, and *Sakuzyo*, along with whole genres like progressive house, and bits and pieces of every other artist that they listen to!

**12** upbeat tunes are part of [**Dvwnpour**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/503), timed in advance so you can drop them into the editor and immediately start mapping.

Replace silence (or the tinnitus ringing in your ears) with **Dvwnpour**:

### [Dvwnpour & Mediy0 - Starpop](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/503/Songs/Dvwnpour%20-%20Starpop%20(feat.%20Mediy0).osz)

Let's face it: 10K osu!mania is too many keys for the average player. That's why [\[SPNG\] Sim0](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3262821) and [ytho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/33661605) played [this 10K osu!mania map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2363664) by [Rurvker](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24526335) together at [COE 2025](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event)!

This is not a drill. All **12** tracks are on [**Dvwnpour**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/503) as pre-timed `.osz` files. You know what to do, and if you don't, we trust you'll figure it out.

Next week we'll be handling our Featured Artist announcement a little differently.

Stay tuned.
