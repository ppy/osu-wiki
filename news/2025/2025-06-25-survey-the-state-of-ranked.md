Opinions wanted — help us pave the way forward for the future of the Ranked beatmap section!

As the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure) section has quickly become the most varied (and active!) it has ever been over the last couple years, we would like to take a moment to ask you — the community — for your feelings on the section's current state. Admittedly, this is not a task we can tackle alone, so we want to understand your opinions on where we are and where to go moving forward.

The mapping landscape is constantly evolving, and knowing what most of the community wants at any given time is difficult. Answering these questions will take no more than 5 minutes and will be very helpful to us!

Much like other surveys we've done in the past, we'll break down the results by area in the community: players, mappers, [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators), and so on. This will help us compare and contrast between perspectives.

The polls will be open for **2 weeks**, and the results will be posted in a separate news post soon right after, alongside some initial impressions from the team.

As always, we appreciate your feedback! Thank you for taking the time to participate in the poll, and we hope to put the newfound results to good use.
