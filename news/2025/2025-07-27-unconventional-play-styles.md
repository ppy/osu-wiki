## [Medal Hunting](#navigation)

osu! medal hunting is a style of playing that involves playing osu! to obtain very cool looking shiny heptagons that say you did something special. *Oh I would hope you don't think it's that simple.*

Unlike most other materialistic ways of showing skill in this game, such as ranking or pp, medals, previously but also technically known as achievements, are official goals that devs have put into the game since nearly the beginning that encourage you to play osu! in ways you may fear or never have thought of, and you get medals for doing them, which makes for a very thrilling experience! Besides participating in some World Cup for #1, I feel like these medals are the closest one can get to beating the game officially.

Medals are a bunch of challenges, jokes, and cultural references, some of which can be ridiculously silly or peak lunacy, which test you in very unique ways. If you do what the medal demands of you, it's for yours to obtain to say you were able to pull it off! You can boast about it if you wish. And after enough osu! medal hunting, you can make players scroll past that wall of medals you have in your profile, because you played the game in very specific ways that not everybody can!

On top of this, medals have a Hush-Hush and Hush-Hush (Expert) category that not only are quests of varying difficulty, but as Hush-Hush implies, are secrets, sending osu! medal hunters out to go hunt for how exactly they are supposed to get them, typically with only a medal icon, hint (flair text), and subhint. That does mean osu! medal hunters under normal circumstances can never know the full solution to these medals. The criteria is very flexible too, needing players of varying calibers for both hint parsing and theory testing.

This makes the osu! community effort in osu! medal hunting mandatory. Together, the community decides how much of a solution is known, if certain modes or mods can be tested at all for a medal solution, which maps are known or created for certain medals, the routing for medals â€” everything for osu! medal hunting! Your niche osu! knowledge, interests, or skills will not be of waste! osu! medal hunting can be done at any time and done on the side of what you normally do in osu!. *No promises on some medals being consistent in difficulty though!* It sure would be nice if it was.

Since I first registered in osu!, I immediately liked the medal unlock animation and sound effect that played whenever I somehow unlocked a medal and was already the type to like 100%'ing video games as they usually allow me to enjoy the whole experience. I medal hunted here and there, but it truly started when I unlocked "True Torment" entering 2022, and true torment some of those damn medals are. "Not Bluffing" was like the front door to insanity to me, yes, only the front door, and it's very dark inside.

I was going to school fearing of coming back home because it meant I had to continue grinding that medal no matter what, and me getting the medal meant I was freed from it, which was quite the mindset. I would say grinding and obtaining this medal set a precedent for what more I could do in osu! medal hunting.

To always grind medals and scout for medal routes with such unending intensity, especially with medals that have or had difficulty inconsistency, this hobby felt deeper than just being *obsessed*. Gradually over time, this felt increasingly overwhelming. I would set medal goals. Some would have sudden ridiculous arbitrary time limits that were not even set by me. The medals could be absolute torture but I would know that no matter how many more I obtained or even gave up on, I would always want to do more if I had even the slightest hope I could. And stopping at all meant brute forcing even harder and putting even more thought into how to keep going.

Gradually yet suddenly, it may start to seem like the medals are the ones hunting their hunter. And I see osu! medal hunters experience this from time to time, unfortunately. osu! medal hunting does take mental fortitude. While an absence of mental can mean no mental to affect may sound clever, that is not a good idea, as that'd also mean not having a mental that can be good. That idea certainly is *madness*, and *of an ailing mind*, you may not notice it immediately. I hope you notice it like I have. It is nice to have the osu! medal hunting community make breakthroughs on medals and reach goals, but I do feel the need to warn that osu! medal hunters should watch out that their mindset is not that of *internment*.

What if I tell you that there was an official event that is one of my favorites, that ironically encapsulated this insanity that the osu! medal hunting community can have? It was the "Internment" medal hunt.

The "Internment" medal hunt took place in a new medal batch having been released that included 7 other Hush-Hush medals that were either normal or expert. The icon, hint, and subhint were so direct that it always felt like the solution was right there. Even with extra hints, some from even peppy himself through a recording, we were still struggling yet had so much hope and curiosity. It felt like a really awesome mission where everybody was involved in some way and had so much interest, because that whole time, it felt like the solution was right there even though our imaginations could make it seem like it was this extraordinary mystical solution that could be anything. It felt magical. The thread in Discord for the hunt being complete chaos, all the unbounded schizo theories, how I myself created a separate thread that from the main Internment channel since some of us got tired of these schizo ideas. Ephemeral really outdid himself with the creation of this medal idea and having it be implemented. This was the perfect sequel to "The Girl in the Forest" medal that had its osu! Medal Hunter title. I think the difficulty of finding this medal being just fair enough could not have been nailed any more perfectly. After UberFazz became the first to obtain the medal and also get the osu! Medal Hunter title, when I saw the solution, I was in awe from how a challenging-to-find medal like this could even be made where the hints are actually so good and the medal made so much sense after finding the solution.

If you wish to learn more about what was happening during this event, you can read a [news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-18-the-hunt-for-internment) written about it.

## [Speedrunning](#navigation)

When hearing "osu! speedruns" you may think: How can one even speedrun a game with no definite goal and many new beatmaps coming out daily? Well, you actually can, in multiple ways in fact!

While there is no official and definite end goal, 8 years ago one of the osu! players created an [unofficial leaderboard on speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/osu) for osu!, adding multiple categories to it, including a category that is still a default one to this day, "Full Combo". Like you guessed from the name, this category requires you to FC different amounts of maps (10/25/50/100) as fast as you can, with some additional rules (and sub-categories), like all maps having to be ranked/approved or only being allowed to play 1 difficulty per beatmap. 

![full combo milestones screenshot](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-27-unconventional-play-styles/full_combo_milestones.png)

Doesn't seem like there's much room for improvement after the shortest maps are found, right? Surprisingly, that's not exactly true!

Yes, current ranking criteria doesn't allow beatmaps shorter than 30 seconds, people found other opportunities to FC the maps faster than others, from literally learning how to switch between maps in the menu faster to finding how to use offset and **cropped MP3's** to their advantage. What do I mean by cropped MP3's? Well, what runners do is they cut the MP3 file right where the final spinner begins, making it end instantly when playing the map, without breaking your combo. So as you can see, there are some unique ways your time can be improved.

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

Â  Â  <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7M1iIaJUCsw?t=27" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>

But obviously that's not the only category there is! There are some more ways you could try speedrunning this game, from [FCing all beatmaps in one of the classic beatmap packs](https://www.speedrun.com/osu/levels), to trying to reach certain [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_points) milestones in McOsu (an open source practice client developed by one of the osu! players, [McKay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3321909)) as fast as possible.

Speaking of the latter, pp milestones was also one of the most popular categories on the leaderboard since the moment I created it. It was so popular in fact, that as of recently (01.06.2025) it has its own [McOsu leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/McOsu)! 

![mcosu milestones screenshot](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-27-unconventional-play-styles/mcosu_milestones.png)

And while 100pp milestone is obviously the most popular one, because of it being the easiest and fastest to do (so fast in fact that the current world record is shorter than 10 seconds), there is another specific milestone I'd like to mention here, 7500pp.

Maybe this category doesn't seem that interesting to get a mention, after all it has way less speedruns submitted, and is second to highest milestone currently, and it was like that until one day a [certain player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10137731) decided to start and fund a speedrunning event on his own. So a bit later [this](https://twitter.com/osuallstars/status/1500116465277493274) Twitter post was created, and we as the leaderboard mods were contacted about the event, so we made a copy of said post on the website itself.

![website announcement screenshot](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-27-unconventional-play-styles/speedrun_event_announcement.png)

And of course such an event was noticed by multiple top players some of you know well, for example [mrekk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7562902) and [lifeline](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11367222)! Speaking of lifeline, his strategy closer  to the end of the event is worth mentioning in my opinion. At the moment, mrekk got the fastest run, and it was the fastest for some time, but we didn't know that lifeline already got a faster run, deciding to submit it the very last moments before the event concluded, not giving mrekk any time to get a faster one, and granting lifeline his victory!

So yeah, there actually are multiple ways you could speedrun osu! as you can see, and interesting ones at that. If that sounds interesting to you just it does to me, I recommend you to actually try to speedrun some category from [osu!](https://www.speedrun.com/osu/) or [McOsu](https://www.speedrun.com/McOsu) leaderboard!

## [Completion](#navigation)

osu! completion may be one of the first things that come to mind when discussing an "unconventional playstyle," and that's understandable. It is a natural instinct to complete a game and experience it fully, but on osu!, it's a completely different story, with over an estimated 170k ranked beatmaps across all modes and more being ranked every day, it is a gargantuan task that requires an insane amount of time and dedication to be able to pull it off, who would be insane enough to go through all of that? Well, some people will, so let's take a deep dive into this playstyle, and look at what it takes to become a completionist.

First, what is completion? Completion is usually defined as completing every ranked beatmap of a given game mode. Seems simple right? Well, not exactly. If this were the case, people could simply AFK after getting 10,000 points to submit the score. Due to this, most people's definition of completion generally includes an additional requirement that includes playing through each map in its entirety, or reaching a certain accuracy threshold as a way to disqualify AFK players from being considered completionists.

Now that we have a general understanding of what completion is, why go for it? After all, why would someone go through finishing every beatmap when there is no real benefit? Well, maybe there is. There are many reasons why completionists set this goal in the first place.

Some players are already score farmers and want a new challenge, something more mentally demanding than just grinding performance points. Others are inspired by former completionists. For many, it's a personal goal they've set for themselves, a way to test their endurance, commitment, and to get some shiny ranks. And sometimes, it's simply the satisfaction of finishing something monumental. They just want to complete it, no strings attached.

To conclude, completion is not for the faint of heart. It requires hours and hours of dedication and mental resilience. If you are an aspiring completionist or already on your road to becoming one, good luck on your journey and we hope that you will make it through the finish line!

> Note from MegaMix: As a bonus, we've also asked a few completionists some questions to see how they personally view this play style. You can view their answers [here](link_placeholder)! <!-- Should link to a file with all answers of each completionist we asked. Also may want to rewrite this note, I'm not sure. -->

## [Unusual Devices](#navigation)

Ever since osu! was released, 99% of the player base use a mouse or tablet to aim, and two fingers on the keyboard to click the circles. While there are some players who prefer playing on a touchscreen, mouse only with using the mouse buttons to click, or other devices, there are some players crazy enough to make obscure play styles that go beyond the norm that surprisingly work.

If you've ever looked at the keystrokes on the right of your screen, you may notice that there's four keys on there. Two for your keyboard strokes, and two for your mouse strokes. Usually you would use one or the other, but how about using all four of them? One of the biggest advantages for using this play style is that you're able to get additional speed and stamina while pushing the boundaries of raw speed and technical tapping. While this might seem impossible to do as you need to use four of your fingers which can get pretty hard at times, some have been able to pull it off.

Meet [120-cell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12571145), a top osu! player who uses all four keys who has pulled incredible plays with this play style. For example, they've managed to pull off a HDDT FC on [xi - over the top \[uri's extra\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2072719#osu/4343206), you can check out a liveplay of them down below!

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

Â  Â  <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7b5fExTIbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>

However, they're just one of many people using this play style. There's an entire [team](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams/2657) dedicated to using four keys at once filled with many talented players, so go support them!

If you thought that was crazy, how about playing osu! with your feet? No, this isn't a joke. Back in October 2020, osu! player and content creator [Kariyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4733121) made a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/jfzodn/highest_star_140_foot_fc_world_record_2pp/) <!-- Utiba's note: Should we embed the Reddit video for this one? --> about getting an FC with just his feet. This became a trend in the osu! community to see who could set the best play with just only feet with many players such as [Kuvster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4896624) and [SmoreJoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1431354) trying their best to one up each other to see who could set the highest star rating FC or highest PP play. Another player who brought wide spread attention to this trend was [Hugofrost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6896883), with him setting the new highest feet pp record of 15pp.

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

Â  Â  <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ms5Ro1hLaOo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>

However, one player saw this and decided "What if I used my feet to click to the circles?", and thus a player named [Toesu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4432408) (a.k.a. MrDinklepuss) made waves in the osu! community for his play style of using his feet to click the circles. Many people thought he wouldn't get far, but he was sure to prove them wrong. After using the play style for three and a half years, he currently has a top play of 859pp on [Victorius - Age of Tyranny \[Revolt\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2219231#osu/4704020). He has also uploaded a liveplay of this score, so make sure to check it out.

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

Â  Â  <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8HtkZ50mS4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>

While it may just seem like he's doing it just to show off, his goal is to bring a new player base such as drummers or people with disabilities to the game. And he's clearly proven that you can 100% without a doubt play osu! with your feet without having any setbacks.

There are countless other play styles with osu!, but it would get too long to mention every single one of them as there's too many to cover, so here's a few silly ones! [Mafham](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3660531) is a player who likes to mess around with the game a lot with many different play styles, but one of his more famous ones has to be where he used a tennis ball as an aiming device to test out an absolute positioning mouse prototype. This would actually become a thing called the "Mablet" playstyle later on in the future!

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">

Â  Â  <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGCTo7Lo_gc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>

Some players such as [cinnamon1213](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24304363) would [use a Steam Deck to play osu!](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/s/OCJqFDX2Wp) as well thanks to the device having a little trackpad on the side.

<!-- Utiba's Note: Should we embed the Reddit video for this one? -->

These players have definitely shown that you do not need a mouse, a tablet, or two of your fingers on your keyboard to play osu!, and that you can play with just about anything. Maybe today you should try using a device lying around in your home just for fun and see what crazy scores you can achieve!

We sincerely hope you enjoyed our news post, and while there are more play styles we didn't mention, such as ranked elo lobbies or playing with specific mod combos, we also hope you've found something interesting to try yourself! Thanks for reading <3
