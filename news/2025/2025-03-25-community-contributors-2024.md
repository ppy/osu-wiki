Let's roll the drumrolls and prepare the stage for osu!'s exceptional Community Contributors!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/header.jpg)

Considered a rare commodity in the online realm nowadays, osu! is a game that thrives on its community, with its people being the backbone of most (if not all) aspects of the game. It's why we hold this yearly tradition of celebrating the individuals who have made a lasting impact on us all, and we are more than proud to grant them the coveted [**Community Contributor**](/wiki/People/Community_Contributors) accolade.

Let's get started!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/0x84f.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724)

May be *news* to you, but certainly not to them! Without [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724), the news section we know today would probably not be as packed full of awesome articles as we currently have. A commodity so ubiquitous yet so demanding given the massive time investment and effort it requires.

If that was not enough, 0x84f's contributions to the game span well beyond news alone! Their efforts as part of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) have not gone unnoticed, currently leading the team alongside their peers. Suffice to say, despite their relatively short tenure, they have added considerable value to the game. And worry not, for they have no plans to retire any time soon~!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/Sakura006.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024)

Hailing from Malody spheres, [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) took the World Cup original song production to the next level. Starting 2024, the difference was immediate — more and more [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) have surfaced with better illustrations, designs and videos to accompany them.

Together with a whole team of designers, illustrators, VFX artists and storyboarders, Sakura006 coordinates all World Cup visuals. His own expertise in VFX has also yielded memorable video sequences at the beginning of select osu! originals, including [DiSANiMATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm-LUm-1qzI), [Sunao ni Naritai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxHRlQN7oOk), [Frost Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBPEdmfYPWM), [Zenithfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r459I7A-Rds), [Ruin in Cascade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDt7cJ_YiUE) and [Lost Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmccFHPScKA). Give these works a view and you'll understand why everyone appreciates having him around!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/Ascendance.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883)

Ever since the days of old in 2016, Lord [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) of House Yoshi has been growing and expanding his reach all throughout the osu!catch modding and mapping scene. He inevitably grew into an absolute behemoth in the lands of osu!catch, becoming a name that is synonymous with the game mode.

On the community side, he took the reins of various projects. He is responsible for the creation of the [osu!catch Modding & Mapping Hub](https://discord.com/invite/ZuxFc4q), leading the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), as well as hosting the [osu!catch Mapping World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1596151?n=1) for 3 widely successful iterations. Finally, to round it all off, he won nearly every mapping related award from 2017–19, serving as an inspirational figure for nearly everyone in the catch mapping scene.

Ascendance is a figure that is to be respected, with a set of skills to strive for. If you have been around the catch community, his contributions are ones that can absolutely not be ignored. Even to this day, some years past his peak activity, he is still hailed as one of the greats of his mode.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/Greaper.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2369776)

Many men, from peasant to lord, tell the tale of [Greaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2369776). They say he's one of the greatest smithies this side of the Four Kingdoms. Greaper solves problems. When his men shudder at the thought of entering battle unarmed, he crafts them the finest blades.

His most notable pieces to date are the [osu! Nomination Planner](https://bnplanner.greaper.net/), allowing osu!catch Nominators to better organise which maps they're going to push up to the Ranked section, and the [osu!catch Mapset Verifier plugin](https://github.com/Darius-Wattimena/MapsetChecksCatch), adding support for integral osu!catch-specific issues to be caught in the program. He's done all this while consistently holding his position as [NAT](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) member for five years and counting. This tale is not over yet, and who's to say what armaments he may create to push his people to the upper echelon of society.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/Maxus.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785)

These days, it's hard to imagine the osu!mania mapping community without [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785). After stepping back up to the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) in 2022 after a long vacation, he has worked tirelessly for his game mode, ensuring the happiness and peace of its users through hours of work on a wide variety of projects. From the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) to [Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved), and [Beatmap Spotlights](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights) to [Community Mentorship](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2027351?n=1), there isn't a place you can go in osu! without seeing Maxus, always representing the osu!mania community and guiding it to greater heights than ever thought possible.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/mint.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)

For those vaguely acquainted with osu!mania mapping and tournament circles, you must've heard by now the name of [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) dropped at least once, from her extensive mapping catalogue ranking hit piece after hit piece since 2019, to her brief but still outstanding captaincy in [Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved), as well as her many contributions to the osu!mania tournament scene. Such contributions include but aren't limited to organising the [osu!mania 4K World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC#osu!mania-4k-world-cup), nurturing future staff members via the [RAFT](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1912977) series of tournaments, and her many efforts ranking [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music). Suffice to say her contributions to the mapping community are plenty more — much more than one paragraph alone can convey!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/MrHeliX.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2330619)

If you've been playing osu! sometime within the last few years, the name [Mr HeliX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2330619) may not ring an immediate bell, but *huismetbenen* certainly will!

Mr HeliX has been one of the main backbones of the pp development ecosystem, providing and streamlining tools that assist community performance point developers with testing out and previewing their changes, most notably with the website [huismetbenen](https://pp.huismetbenen.nl/), a website you've *definitely* used at least once to see how much your *Harumachi Clover* top play has been nerfed.

The website has become a community staple for debating performance algorithms and making it easier to give feedback on ongoing proposals and upcoming reworks.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/tsunyoku.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11315329)

A relatively new face in the contribution scenes, [tsunyoku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11315329)'s involvement with performance point development has been monumental from the day he joined the [pp Committee](/wiki/People/Performance_Points_Committee). He embarked on the mission of managing and organising the development efforts alongside StanR via handling code reviews, tackling communication efforts between the developers and the community, and making sure changes are deployed smoothly.

His contributions weren't limited to the pp space only — with our dev team's focus on the osu!(lazer) client soaring at an all-time high, sometimes the crusty cogs running the game need special attention, and we have tsunyoku to thank for that. From handling quality-of-life improvements like the support for cycling in-game banners in the main menu, to more significant changes like refactoring the systems behind osu!(stable) difficulty calculation to remove the once-dreaded separation of online and local star rating, and allowing future performance point algorithm changes to be ported to osu!(stable) in an easier manner.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/emanfman.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4136150)

Once (or thrice) upon a time, various communities banded together to build their artwork on a public canvas pixel by pixel, in Reddit's "[r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place)" event. The osu! community was no exception, and here, [emanfman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4136150) led hundreds of osu! players to build osu!'s cookie logo and defend it against other users who weren't as fond of the pink aesthetic.

It's not often that the community is united in a wide-scale way, and anyone who watched it unfold can attest to the [unforgettable memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iKKTf0vELI) made during those days.

The legacy of r/place quietly lives on in [pxls.space](https://pxls.space/), where a group of pixel placers still builds the osu! logo along with other art associated with osu! beatmaps, [every canvas iteration](https://archives.pxls.space/), one pixel at a time.

### Community projects

Many of the tools developed by some community members have become so ubiquitous that we rarely think about the problems they solve anymore. These tools, made by the community for the community, have provided users with plenty of quality-of-life improvements throughout the years. We believe these efforts are worthy of recognition and therefore want to spend time thanking the developers of some of the most used tools across the community.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/cyperdark.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9893708)

There should be little to no surprises seeing [cyperdark](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9893708) get the recognition they deserve! You may know them from hosting [cpol](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8JgvW-qJJIl6pnU48tjqFA), one of the most popular osu! replay channels on YouTube. Alternatively, you may have inevitably used one of their [tools](https://tools.osuck.net/?query=cyperdark), whether it be their [powerful skinning tools](https://skins.osuck.net/tools/skin.ini), their [website colour changer](https://userstyles.world/style/1767/osu-color-changer) or their [exhaustive skin repository](https://skins.osuck.net/)! Lastly, developers of other tools may know them best for the [TypeScript osu!api wrapper](https://github.com/cyperdark/osu-api-extended) they developed.

It's hard to understate the impact community-driven tooling has had on osu!, which is exactly why we want to honour cyperdark's lasting impact on this space.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/FunOrange.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2051389)

If you've ever sat pickaxe in hand, chipping away at the thick skill wall that has formed in your path, wishing you had a *lazer* to blast through it, they say [FunOrange](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2051389) will approach you, a hooded figure guiding you on an alternative path.

Meet [osu-trainer](https://github.com/FunOrange/osu-trainer/releases/latest), a tool that allows you to adjust the rate and difficulty settings of any beatmap with ease, opening up the opportunity for those on the stable release of osu! to enjoy the freedom of improving at whatever rate they see fit.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/oneplusone.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1843447)

[oneplusone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1843447) is the mastermind behind one of osu!'s most used browser extensions. [osuplus](https://github.com/limjeck/osuplus) provides users with a **plethora** of features that add extra functionality to the website, some of which were added to the main site!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/Stevy.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5053158)

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-03-25-community-contributors-2024/Badewanne3.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2211396)

[Stevy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5053158), creator of [owo! bot](https://owo-bot.xyz/), and [Badewanne3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2211396), creator of [Bathbot](https://github.com/MaxOhn/Bathbot), are the masterminds behind two of the most popular [Discord](https://discord.com/) bots for all things osu!-related. Users found both bots very handy tools to have across the years, being able to keep track of scores, rankings and more from the comfort of their friends' servers.

With our heartfelt gratitude, we extend our deepest thanks to every soul who has dedicated their time and effort to making this community what it is today, and we eagerly await the chance to celebrate those who follow in their footsteps.

—the osu! team
