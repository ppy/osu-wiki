Fiiine, we'll put the Project Loved picks in the bag.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

As the heat is raging on in most parts of the world still, we're here to provide you with a refill of Project Loved picks to stay cool to this summer! If you're new to the community and need an intro, Project Loved hosts community polls every month, with [captains of each respective game mode](https://loved.sh/contributors) choosing maps, and the community choosing whether those maps get promoted to the Loved category!

Click on the beatmap banners below to vote for individual picks, or browse all the picks directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting will be open for 10 days, so be sure to participate on time! As always, more details can be found on [the wiki](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and the [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh/).

Want to see your favourite map loved, or even submit a map of your own? Feel free to submit your map on the website, and the captains might just include it in an upcoming month!

*description written by [BATBALL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15173952)*

Beginning with our first *Popular Playcount* pick this month, we're bringing back clip-farm into Loved this month with [Mitsukiyo - FEEEEVER TIME](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1686160#osu)!

From 5.38★ all the way to 8.79★, this mapset is a limit-pushing exercise for novices and top players alike. All five difficulties feature a plethora of mechanical skills, ranging from streams and tapping to intense finger control and aim control. You might even be able to compete among [the greats](https://youtu.be/jvFim7m4b9U?si=2DeaRmvlbDf_kqpL) on these difficulties' leaderboards!

Make sure to give this map a try when you're warmed up. Oh, also throw in a YES vote this month while you're at it...

It's time to bust out the headphones. August's second *Popular Playcounts* nomination is [goreshit - wasting my time](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1257407#osu/2612742). d-_-b

Although [Froslass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19048) (formerly Mismagius/Blue Dragon) may be more closely associated with his Loved captainship over the past few years, some of his oldest beatmaps have helped shape the category from its inception. This month, we bring you one of his modern classics, having racked up over 100,000 playcount since its upload in 2020. Clearly, thousands of players did not feel like they were wasting their time when downloading this map, and if 3 minutes of constant 214 BPM bursts sounds up your alley, you'd better join them.

Alright, quit wasting YOUR time reading this and go vote YES on this beatmap!!

This month's Outstanding Oldies is Super Driver by izacchi, eLy, and Satellite!

If you've been craving some classic 2015 map goodness, this one is for you. Teaming up almost 10 years ago, the trio cooked up this 4-minute map chock-full of jumps and streams that'll bring you back to the good old days; hell, I even felt like I was teleported back to when I played osu! straight from school when I see this map. It's a pretty underrated pick, only sitting around 70 favorites at the moment, but I promise you this map is a hidden gem classic. If 2015 sounds like your jam, then it's time to *super drive* yourself to play this map!

When the stakes are at their highest, only one map can decide it all: Alter//Strife.

Brought to life by the combined talents of Sad Keyboard Guy, sleepless, Myntian, and the haunting vocals of vally.exe, this masterpiece blends emotion and intensity into a single, unforgettable experience. Mapped by Alvearia, Yugu, and others, this month's second *Wildcard* pick is none other than the [Vietnam osu! Championship 2022](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1639421?n=1) Grand Finals tiebreaker. Setting the stage for the ultimate test of skill and endurance, this custom demands a plethora of mechanical and technical abilities.

It's important we continue to give recognition to beautiful community projects, and this is no exception. Vote yes to see more!

You all thought I was lying when I said I was getting this loved? Well, no, I was NOT!

Are you guys ready for a [Setsuna Trip](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1218814)? Because this set got you all!

[Mayumi Morinaga - Setsuna Trip](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1218814) by [Settia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2445897) is a high-BPM alternator / jump map that provides a satisfying experience for both high difficulty players and those who wish to challenge themselves. This set also provides a nerfed difficulty for the demographic not able to hit those massive jumps that would make the average player lose all their HP as soon as possible.

I hope you like it and vote positively, because [Settia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2445897) maps never disappoint!

Also small reminder, a version of this song with a [5\* difficulty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/184686#osu/442037) has been previously loved, check it out if you like this song in general, because I really do.

This month's *Ranked Rejects* nomination is [Marmalade butcher - Floccinaucinihilipilification](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1471155#osu/3020256). Try saying that five times fast.

This song has Featured Artist [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220) doing what they do best, having made a name for themselves with intricate and intense math rock bangers. Although it's not quite as hellish as the [previously Loved mapset by melloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1331748#osu/2759110), given the top difficulty was created as a Grand Finals pick for The Perennial 2021, it is certainly no cakewalk. Thankfully, mappers [LeCandy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6626249) and [Nozuchi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5858447) have created an Insane and Extra difficulty respectively, and the way I see it, the more people that can experience this song, the better.

Anyways, it's finally time for melonboy's magnum opus of a storyboard going to work to finally have a shot at Loved. The throne for *Gameplay Gimmicks* awaits as this monstrosity of a map tests your patience, pattern-processing capabilities, multitasking, and overall understanding of what could actually even be going on. Whether it's the crazy rhythms, the tricky Cytus-like timing bars, or whatever the lyrics could ever possibly mean, this map is going to take you on an experience like no other, and it could finally get the leaderboard it rightfully deserves.

So... I literally waited a year just for this map to be eligible for voting. Surely that means you can take 5 seconds to vote yes?

I'm sorry, I had to do it. If you know this song through either Reels or TikTok... you know what you're getting into here. I didn't know any better either, trust me...

[Juufuutei Raden - Maitake Dance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2235508#osu) is not your typical brainrot song, it is from a very wholesome virtual YouTuber from Hololive! While she made many funny songs like this, this was by far the most popular out of them all.

This song became a hit worldwide with the amount of edits and memes it caused, I'd be surprised if you watch any sort of anime memes or similar in TikTok and never got this song on your For You Page.

Anyways, back into the set... [GirlsKissing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16584802) (cool name btw) took the spotlight back hosting it when this song was on the rise in the west social media and made quite an enjoyable spread with a few mappers you might or might not recognize.

The guest difficulties are from [OnLoong](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13524541), [Take](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19322780) and [vodit51321](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19670323)!

While this is a YouTube-Short-sized beatmap, I hope you enjoy this month's Meme Monstrosities pick.

I truly love horses, and I also love Karcher... I want everyone to take a look at this map, actually.

For this month's *Wildcard* pick... We got... Horses? Jumps? A little bit of both? Yep.

That's right, [Various Artists - GIRLS' LEGEND U](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1679653) is straight up a raw aim map, no questions asked.

I remember he was mapping this back in the good old 2022 as if it were yesterday, he purposefully made it for himself and made it as fun and hard as he could, so I can see why people also find this fun to play. The current trend of mapping Uma Musume made me remember this map, no matter the year I still find it a fun set and wish to promote it to a bigger audience.

If you can't pass the [Hashire!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1679653#osu/3431450) difficulty, I recommend playing the HP3 one instead.

HUGE honorable mention to [mx10000](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3730848)'s guest difficulty, a sharp angle simple jump map! You heard that right, this is likely also one of the most fun difficulties to push your limits and practice your aim.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. Now, please go vote!

For this month's third *Wildcard* pick, [Naidaaka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6988856) makes another appearance in Project Loved with [lapix - Foolish Hero!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/681122#osu)

You may have heard of Naidaaka before as the mapper of [Logical Stimulus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/651507#osu) and [Technical Master](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/630818#osu/1331610), notoriously known for their difficulty — and today is no exception!

This map features some iconic patterns and is typical of what would nowadays be considered a "clip farm" map. The kiai section towards the very end features relentless alt patterns that range from sharper angle wiggles to huge snaps that feel just as scary to hit as satisfying. There are also many hints of playful gameplay beforehand, utilising overlaps that try to throw players off, as well as sprinkles of aim control that just about prepare you for what's to come.

Whether you want to see what players are capable of or if you want to prove yourself worthy of a leaderboard spot yourself, the next step should be to vote Yes for this map in the poll!

[Culprate - Beast (Vorso Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1963887#taiko/4070839), is mapped by a familiar name in the osu! community, [YonGin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7109317). He may not be widely known for his beatmaps, more so for his strong presence in the osu!taiko, osu!catch, and even pick'em communities, but don't count him out when it comes to mapping; he's an absolute mastermind when it comes to gimmicks. In this map, [YonGin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7109317) cleverly manipulates slider velocity to complement the song's rich sound effects, and uses barline gimmicks and 0 BPM notes to take the gameplay to a whole new level of spice.

Despite its relatively low star rating, this map offers a uniquely fun experience — whether you're a seasoned drummer or on your newbie taiko journey. If you want to see this map get the Loved treatment, be sure to cast your precious 'Yes' vote!

Those who like tech maps should take note. This map may be too stimulating for you...

PSYQUI - Hysteric Night Girl feat. Such (Chouhoukitekisochi 170 Edit) is a map mainly based on 1/6 of the map mapped by Tiera. Kiai has a unique 1/6 configuration, which makes it difficult to figure out how to hit the keys.\
This map is designed to consume stamina, especially towards the end, so it may be a pipe dream to even think about getting an S rank, let alone a pass... ToT

This map is not only challenging, but also fits the song well, making it very enjoyable to play!\
Why not try playing with HT attached for fun, or attach HD or HR (or DT for robots) for a very hard play?

Have fun! Enjoy!! <3

[ParagonX9 - Infiltration](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1069209#taiko) by [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091) is a map that you've likely played before, maybe several times. Since its upload time, this map has become a hotspot for mid-ranged taiko players looking to test their tech skills, and it's no wonder why it has amassed such a high playcount over the years.

The track this is mapped to might also be nostalgic and/or familiar to some due to its presence in other games, so add this with Genjuro's expertise on map creation, and you have the perfect formula for an engaging and memorable map. A map with such a high importance in several players' growth and journey sounds like the perfect candidate for the Loved category, but it's up to you once again to decide, so go ahead and make sure no "infiltrators" ruin this for you!

This map is known within the community as a "cool map", and it is no exaggeration to say that it is a map that is often played in multiplayer.\
There are 4 different difficulty levels available, making this a map that can be enjoyed by a wide range of players.

When you actually play it, you will find that it is a fast-paced map where time flies by in the blink of an eye. We encourage you to try it out for yourself.

Finishing off this month's picks, I've decided to nominate [Dirty Doll](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1786298#taiko/3718466) by [nananass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7231722) and [Red Riding Hood](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8050850)!

The artist — [Rahatt](https://soundcloud.com/rahatt_bc) — is absolutely no stranger to the osu!taiko scene, so much so that he has recently made an appearance in the [osu!taiko World Cup 2025](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2025) with an osu! original — [Gunoi Chop](https://soundcloud.com/rahatt_bc/gunoi-chop). He's pretty much THE osu!taiko breakcore artist. This is further proven by the fact that 11 out of 12 Rahatt maps with a leaderboard are osu!taiko maps!

To comment on the map, it's nass business as usual: the insane snapping changes, the sierpiński triangle background, the nerfed nas diff... But wait, there's more! Even if you're not a fan of nass' mapping style, you might want to give 3san's diff a shot. It takes a more standard approach to mapping breakcore and is insanely fun with mods on!

As always, make sure your voice is heard through our monthly polls and (obviously) vote yes!!

*description written by [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462)*

Over the past two years, [Nidoking](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7034422) has gained a lot of popularity among players for their unique approach to mapping. This map of [DJ TOTTO VS TOTTO - vajra](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1977179#fruits/4104474) is one of the first which were done in their signature style.

This absolute monster of a map demands both high mechanical skill and precision, which is a deadly combination for most players (and the AR is not going to make it any better). Thankfully, you do not need to be a top player to enjoy it: the map does not contain any hyperdashes (do **NOT** fact-check me on this), which makes it much more pleasant on EZ. If you want to see this map Loved, please vote 'Yes'!

*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

There aren't a lot of mappers who tackle low AR mapping, and crystal glass is quite the gem. Mapped by [Dika312](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/741613), a name that's already present in the Loved section with a couple maps, even though their last Loved map was about 3 years ago.

It's difficult to utilize low AR in a way that fits a mapping style. You often see low AR maps where it feels like they have low AR just for the sake of having it. But in this case, it goes along so smoothly with the mapping. With the map being set to AR7 it provides a really difficult reading challenge, with some difficult patterns that are easy to misread. Furthermore, this map was mapped for the grand finals of the sixth edition of the popular AxS tournament as a mixed mod pick, showing that it is of really good quality to be used for a big tournament.

If you are very unhinged, you can try to play it with HD (don't do this, for your own sanity) or even add DT if it's too slow. All in all a very fun map, and for anyone that likes to step out of their comfort zone to try something different.

It was part of the famous [val0108](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/243917)'s Approved [beatmapset](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/47710), but was later removed.

Luckily, Spec decided to re-upload it on their own in 2017, allowing new players to experience this fun map that includes some interesting patterns which can be a challenge if you are not prepared for them.

If you're familiar with Noctalium's style, you should know the drill by now: wiggles, triangles, hyperchains, fullscreen jumps, even hyperwiggles — all that at 44,000 BPM this time!.. Well okay maybe not THAT fast, but it's still pretty damn fast.

It might legitimately be a meme map, but we *love* it, right?

[Razor Sharp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414261) is known for creating challenging patterns, and her map [Getty vs. DJ DiA - Ops:Code-Rapture-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/627517#fruits/1322334) is no exception. This mapset is popular among osu!catch players, and aside from the difficulty created by the previously mentioned host, it also includes several other difficulties that will appeal to less experienced players (but also those more experienced if they add some mods).

We're going back to the MWC classics with [AlexDunk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9194799)'s map of *Mr. Scratch Man*!

AlexDunk is a versatile mapper, providing more than just SVs to the tournament scene. He has also recently provided SVs to the ranked section, boasting critical acclaim on maps such as [yax03 - down](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2214269#mania/4691518) or [Chroma feat. mikanzil - Koi no Kuuchuu Bunkai](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2014990). His previous Loved entries were admittedly more popularity oriented, so *Mr. Scratch Man* is going to be his first actual tournament oriented entry.

*Mr. Scratch Man* is a good showcase of AlexDunk-style gimmicks and effects, combining eloquently placed fake outs with smooth transitions. The raw patterning is pretty trilly, which in combination with SVs makes it sometimes quite disorienting if you ever lose your footing. It's honestly a really fun challenge, however, and you may find it very satisfying to execute once you get the hang of it!

Whether you're a fan of SVs, or you just enjoy the challenge, make sure to cast a positive vote on this map!

[STRONG 280](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1759474#mania/3600992) is a very challenging pick, featured in late game stages of tournaments such as the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2023 Finals Mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K#finals), in which this served as one of the jumpstream / stamina picks.

[Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)'s chart of [STRONG 280](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1759474#mania/3600992) might not have the densest jumpstreams; however, its BPM of 280 more than makes up for this lower density. It starts with some light jumpstreams with some rolls/bursts in between, in which many players should be able to have good accuracy still. However, as time passes, the stamina demands become more daunting, along with the jumpstream patterns slowly becoming more "broken". This can really tire you out if you are not careful.

You also only rarely get any break sections in this chart, and even then, there are some chokeable patterns here as they do not necessarily flow continuously, with some anchors, streams, and the occasional jacks. It definitely does not help that this is also a pretty long chart, clocking in at 2:52 minutes. If you do not have the mental stamina required to keep your consistency, chances are you might drop a miss or two later on. Did I forget to mention that there are also rates up to 1.1, which go from 280 to 308 BPM?

Despite the numerous challenges presented by [STRONG 280](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1759474#mania/3600992), many top players are able to score very well on this, given the amount of high 99s we have seen in the MWC scene. With so much potential to see a leaderboard with crazy scores on jumpstream patterns like this, I think it's time to have this up for Loved. If you agree, don't hesitate to vote "Yes" on this chart!

125 – 175 BPM, 2:26 | 4.98★ – 7.67★\
*description written by [SunApple](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11817622)*

Due to the popularity of the SV map of [Polyriddim](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1182702#mania/2465806), the song itself has grown quite a lot in infamy. While there are a lot of maps of the song with a wide variety of patterning present, the map that stands out the most has to be [law38204](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10927256)'s map of [Polyriddim (Izadi House Flip)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1556348#mania/3179432). We have seen law in the Loved section with their chart of [Mood Breaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1231834#mania/4388242) previously, and *Polyriddim* has similarly gotten a lot of praise from the community for how fun it is to play.

Although many people know *Polyriddim* for its polyrhythmic patterning, ironically enough this map's difficulty comes mostly from the 1/4th snapped anchors present in the denser chordjack sections. Many of these dense chordjack sections feature a plethora of transitions, like doubles into triples or doubles into quads, which flow naturally alongside the kicks in the song. Even though the song does simplify a lot of the original song's more awkard timings, there is still a wide variety of snapping especially in the break sections. So be warned, as you will still have to pay close attention during the whole song to get those good accuracy scores that chordjack is known for.

If you are a fan of chordjacks or just like Polyriddim as a song from previously hearing it, I would implore you to vote "Yes" on this chart as soon as you can!

[Mdrqnxtagon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2053448#mania/4289278) was featured in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2023 Semifinals Mapppool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K#semifinals) (at 1.05x rate), and this certainly was a challenging mixed rice / wildcard rice pick.

This chart has a lot in store, as immediately the chart throws you with anchors, bursts, broken jumpstreams, and chordjacks. These parts aren't charted with the most straightforward patterns, making your wrists already unstable and testing your limits in the consistency department. Part of what makes it so challenging is that the chart incorporates numerous patterns in many short bursts, meaning that in little time, you are required to be able to process chordjacks, bursts, anchors, jumpstreams, and many more. This can cause players to really struggle balancing stamina, reading, and accuracy, leading to 200s, bad judgments, and even misses.

There is also only one break section in this chart. Right after the break you are immediately greeted with a chordjack section, leading up to one of the most difficult patterns in the chart, a relentless stream section that includes a lot of anchors. Once again, there are so many skill sets being tested in this chart, which makes it really difficult, and this can definitely throw you off if you are not careful.

Surely, the community loves a great challenge, and don't worry, there are rates up to 1.1x that can make this chart even harder. Are you ready to see how you fare against the best in the world? It's up to YOU to decide whether or not this gets in Loved, or not!

The highly anticipated [Bocchi the Rock! 4K LN Songs pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1891661#mania/4100606) is finally getting a nomination!

As the pack name suggests, you can expect long-note heavy charts within every single song in this pack. Featuring charts from [Begin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10284984), [-SoraIro-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11493286), [\[HD\]Draftz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8890291), [Castella](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4810916), and [eZmmR](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8647138), you can be sure to find at least one song in here that fits your preferences. Well, that's if you play LNs at least...

Chances are you're already familiar with a few names of the mappers in this pack (if you aren't already familiar with the whole pack itself), so it's likely that you might be familiar with the approach to each song. The added OD 3 across every difficulty also makes this a rather lax accuracy challenge for those who aren't too familiar with tough release timings, so you're also able to get a casual-friendly experience if that's what you're seeking!

If you like the chart quality, the song quality, or you just like the anime itself, then go vote in the thread!

[re:||VERSE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1222376#mania/2542531) is a long note chart, and the [Delusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1222376#mania/3902887) difficulty has been featured in the [osu!mania LN Tournament 3 Grand Finals mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/o!mLN/3#grand-finals), for good reason.

[\[Crz\]Crysarlene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871) makes a lot of really difficult LN charts, and this certainly falls more under the technical category. What makes this chart especially difficult is the variety of patterns you have to nail in order to be truly consistent at it, let alone achieve a really good accuracy. With the numerous LN rolls, bursts, and releases, it really depends on the player which aspect they need to focus on. It doesn't help that there are also minijacks present throughout the chart, proving to be a deadly combo-breaker should they lose focus during their run.

[Delusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1222376#mania/3902887) and [Haywire](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1222376#mania/2542531) have minor differences in how some of the minijacks and LN lengths were charted, and while small, these could still be run changers — especially considering that Delusion has a higher OD of 7.7, while Haywire is slightly lower at 7.2.

*If the countless shadows made you blind\
Even so we'll raise the dead sunset\
If the countless losses can't rewind\
Even then we'll fill this frail crescent...*

No matter what struggles the players may face, they get an opportunity to rise through the heavens, speaking for themselves and making a name that stands in the community. With a song like [re:||VERSE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1222376#mania/2542531), motivation lingers throughout, and with a chart as tense as [\[Crz\]Crysarlene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5492871)'s, you have NO CHOICE but to perform at your peak.

The piece evolves with a quiet intensity — layer by layer — building tension and releasing it in waves of delicate harmony and striking contrast, and the players danced through flowing streams and precision taps, every movement echoing the live recording's quiet intensity.\
As the last note rang out and the scores were revealed, the margin was razor-thin.\
A comeback carved out in the final breath of a song that thrives on tension, silence, and release.\
At that moment, it wasn't just background music — it became the soul of the battle, a stage where precision met emotion, and where victory was won not with brute force, but with poise under pressure...

Introducing rosso (Live at Kyoto Concert Hall 2019.10.19), from [Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881), which was the tiebreaker for the [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2024 Finals](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2024_7K).

We think many people are already familiar with this map.\
Various patterns suitable for tiebreakers and pattern designs that provide the best experience for the music, as Evening always does, further enhance the immersive experience of the music.\
The impressive matches that took place between China and the Philippines for a spot in the Grand Final will also remain in everyone's memories.\
We believe this is a great opportunity to relive those emotions or experience Evening's masterpiece once again.

This is a hybrid map leaning more towards rice, with a primary emphasis on streams. The density sits somewhere between dense chordstream and fast stream, and the 204 BPM truly puts players' ability to handle 1/1 big chords to the challenge.

Perhaps, with enough practice on this map, you could reach the skill level of dressurf too xd! Jokes aside, in all, if you enjoy it or feel inclined, please consider casting your vote for us!
