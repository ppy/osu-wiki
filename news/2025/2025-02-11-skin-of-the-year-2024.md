Let's take another look back at 2024 and pick our favourite skins to immortalise in the hall of fame!

As 2025 rolls around, it's time to continue the annual tradition of going through the [skinship compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/) and voting for the best skins of the previous year.

This is also the perfect time to look back at 2024 and remind ourselves of various events and changes that impacted the skinning community. For starters, last year we had 1 official contest with the theme of ["Unchained"](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest/5) — 1839 community members cast their votes on 28 total entries, making the total vote count 4637! That contest also broke records, with **15** all-mode skins and **3** three-mode skins, the biggest counts so far!

When it comes to technical changes to the game clients, osu!(lazer) received a bunch of changes that impacted skinning, so here's a full list, ordered by month:

- In February, a small fix has been applied to some skin sprites that were not being converted to greyscale when required.
- In May, a change was made to the anchor and origin point system that's used to place your skin elements, making the editor easier to use.
- In August, the legacy skin key counter has been added, and some skin elements got additional settings (e.g. the time text can be turned off for the argon progress bar, and the combo element can be adjusted per ruleset).
- In September, star fountains and star bursts were added to osu!(lazer) with full skinning support.
- In October, some elements received extra customisation, allowing the aspect ratio to be customised for the avatar skin elements, and other skin elements got the option of changing their colour in-game.
- In November, the "relative size" option was added for the song progress bar skin element, which means the size will automatically adjust with the game's resolution.

Now that we've gone through everything skinning related that happened in 2024, let's go into the details of the contest itself.
