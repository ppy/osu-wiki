You're a mapper. You know more about this niche side of osu! than anyone else. And now it's time to push your creative bounds with a new batch of Mappers' Guild quests!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

For those uninitiated, the [**Mappers' Guild**](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild) is an MMO-inspired mapping system surrounding osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists). Mappers can [earn rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for completing mapping-related tasks, like ranking maps, participating in contests, and collaborating on [quests](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#quests) (which is what this article is about!).

The Mappers' Guild is open to mappers of any skill level, including those without Ranked maps! See [the system's website](https://mappersguild.com/) or the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)'s `#mappers-guild` channel for details.

## What are priority quests?

- **Anyone can participate in [priority quests](https://mappersguild.com/missions).** Unlike [normal quests](https://mappersguild.com/quests), you don't need to claim priority quests in advance.
- **Quests are tiered by difficulty:**
  - Tier 1 ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png) (easiest, lowest reward)
  - Tier 2 ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)
  - Tier 3 ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)
  - Tier 4 ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png) (hardest, highest reward)
- **Multiple users can complete the same quest**. Most of the time, anyone who accomplishes the quest's objective before the deadline is eligible.

By completing priority quests, you can earn some special rewards too:

- All the usual [Mappers' Guild rewards](/wiki/Community/Mappers_Guild#rewards) for ranking beatmaps
- A [**customised keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) based on a pattern in your map
- A profile badge upon completing 3 priority quests

## New priority quests

**6** new quests have just been added to the [priority quest listing](https://mappersguild.com/missions), all of which will be open to mappers until **October 15, 2025**!

Below is an overview of each quest. If any are confusing, feel free to ask questions in the comments or directly to [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418). Be sure to check the quest pages for additional requirements!

### [Your name goes here](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=68645df0b832ac6f9091f21c) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/bronze-small.png)

You chose your username for a reason. This quest surely isn't the reason though. 

Find an **artist** or a **song title** whose first letter is the same as the **first letter of your username**, then create and rank a difficulty spread of at least Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane for it!

For example, if your username is ***p**eppy*, you could map the artist [**P**anda Eyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/55) or the song [**P**lanetary Exclusion Zone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks/10826).

### [Ease of access](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=68645f68b832ac6f9091f224) ![bronze icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)

As the skill ceiling continues to increase, so does the difficulty of Ranked maps. Some maps are too hard for 99%+ of the playerbase, and that's where you come in.

Find any Featured Artist track whose **only** Ranked map is **over 6 stars**. Create and rank a beatmap in the same game mode, but include a difficulty that is at least **2.00 stars lower** than the previous Ranked version. 

For example, [this song](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?q=title%3D%22%22Y%2FM%2FK%2FM%22%22)'s easiest Ranked map is **6.55 stars**, so if you were to map this song, you'd need to create a difficulty that's **4.55 stars or lower**.

### [Storyboard showcase v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=68645e75b832ac6f9091f220) ![silver icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/silver-small.png)

The first era of osu! mapping put a lot of creative focus on storyboards. This quest is bringing that back!

There's no strict requirements for what counts as "high enough effort" for this — trust your own judgment. Check out the winners from [the first iteration of this quest](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=66f488b156f3f894641d4aca) if you want some ideas!

### [osu!(lazer) trial run](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=68646315b832ac6f9091f237) ![gold icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/gold-small.png)

Depending on who you are (or your computer's specs), this might be the hardest quest to date: create and rank a map where at least **one difficulty is created from start to finish in osu!(lazer)**.

The only way to truly confirm if this is done is with video evidence, so if you're taking on this quest, you'll also need to **screen record the creation process** and provide a link to the video in the map thread/description. 

If you're not sure how to record osu! videos, [this guide](/wiki/Guides/Recording_osu!) can help. If you don't want to go through all of this hassle, this quest might not be for you.

### [Classified: Artist edition v2](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=68646363b832ac6f9091f23b) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

This quest goes back to the roots of the Mappers' Guild: **making maps for upcoming Featured Artists**.

Your goal is to create and rank a map for it to be showcased in the artist's upcoming announcement! To participate in this quest, the first step is to select an artist from the [quest page](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=68646363b832ac6f9091f23b).

Unlike previous Classified quests, this one gives you a decent selection upfront, and allows re-rolling your selection. You're given all available songs for an upcoming artist, and your goal is to create and rank a map for any of them. If all goes well, your map will be showcased in the artist's announcement!

For confidentiality reasons, this quest is only open to experienced Mappers' Guild members.

### [The Hurdle v5](https://mappersguild.com/missions?id=68646398b832ac6f9091f23f) ![platinum icon](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/platinum-small.png)

If you're a new mapper, you don't need extra restrictions on your creativity. Making a map is tough enough on its own.

This quest is simple: **create and rank your first beatmap!**

## Conclusion

As soon as you're ready (meaning right now), head to [the priority quest list](https://mappersguild.com/missions) and figure out what your next map is going to be.

And of course, the `#mappers-guild` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) is always open for anything related to your Mappers' Guild maps, so use it to your advantage.

We'd also like to give an extra shoutout to mappers who've been going above and beyond with priority quests. While most mappers throw in the towel after completing 3 quests and receiving the related profile badge prize, certain mappers have kept up their momentum:

| ::{ flag=FI }:: [Antti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13281473) | 5 |

When priority quests were initially created, we didn't expect this much repeat participation. That's also why we don't have any special prizes for these folks yet, but based on how things are going, we should consider changing that.
