Too late for Valentine's Day, too early for the osu!jet, but just in time for some osu!(lazer) updates.

Despite the impressive key-smashing display that the osu!mania 7K community has put up over the past 7 weeks, the devs managed to keep their heads straight, and bring a bunch of cool updates, some of them even osu!mania-related!

### Gameplay

- **You can now "freestyle" in multiplayer.** If you thought being able to choose your own mods was cool, wait until you learn that you can now select your own **game mode**.

</div>

- **You can now see spectators during gameplay.** The curtain is unveiled, and the audience is revealed.
- **The default UI scale on iOS mobile devices has been improved.** Another win for the mobile rhythm gamers. One thing to note: if you changed your UI scale previously it will be reset to the new 1.0x value to avoid scaling issues.
- **The osu!taiko spinner (swell) has been added.** Not only has the legacy spinner been added, but skinning support has been added for it as well.
- **osu!mania is now more playable on vertical resolutions.** That means portrait gameplay, for the best mobile VSRG experience.

### Editor

- **The precise movement tool has been added.** You can now use coordinates for pinpoint object placing accuracy.
- **You can now access beatmap info and discussion pages from the editor.** Clicking either of these two options will open a new browser tab, rather than the in-game overlay.
- **A percentage progress display has been added to the editor.** A small addition as per community requests.
- **Beatmaps can now be uploaded directly from osu!(lazer).** The basic functionality has been added for now, with more features such as guest difficulty attribution being coming soon.

### Other

- **A daily challenge completion marker has been added.** No need to worry whether you've forgotten to keep your streak, because your profile will show a green border on the daily challenge counter if you played the beatmap of the day.
- **User panels now display up-to-date online statuses.** More and more social features are being brought forward to osu!(lazer).
- **Friend notifications received several changes.** Friend status notifications have been added, but they needed a bit of tuning. Now the notification box is slimmer, new fancy samples have been added for online/offline notifications, and the notification box icons have been updated.

</div>

- **The ruleset icon is now displayed on expanded score panels.** With the addition of freestyle, it became apparent that being able to see which game modes your friends chose on the multiplayer room results screen is a must.
- **Collections now show their beatmap counts in the "manage" dialog.** You can also create collections directly from playlists.
