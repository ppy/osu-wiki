You'd expect [an osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10825836) who pulls inspiration from music heard while clicking circles to create... you know, *rhythm game music*. **kikoyu**, however, is here to break expectations.

**kikoyu** has been a musician for the better half of a decade as both a saxophonist and a guitarist. Within the last year, **kikoyu** took on the daunting task of recording live music, resulting in the debut EP "(im)maturity". Taking math rock/emo likenesses from bands like *Mom Jeans*, *The Fall of Troy*, and our very own [*Strelitzia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/421), **kikoyu** delivers a fresh sound to osu! as our newest Featured Artist!

**7** tracks now rest on [**kikoyu**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/497). Download a pre-timed `.osz` and make something.

Hear **kikoyu** for yourself:
