The weekend is here, and with it comes a new Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/483/header.jpg)

There are three quintessential elements of London: Big Ben, the River Thames, and **Shirobon**.

Blending the sound of video game sound chips with Y2K dance music, **Shirobon**'s sound embodies 1990s and 2000s nostalgia in a way that hits harder than you can imagine. Luckily for you, imagination isn't necessary when you can listen to the tracks for yourself.

**10** tracks have made their way to [**Shirobon**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/483), all with the usual pre-timed beatmap templates!

Experience them for yourself:

We would've thought the speed of light was as fast as anything could be, but the way you're heading to [**Shirobon**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/483) to find the song for your next map is somehow faster. Breaking physics is fine, but please don't break the editor too.

Next week's Featured Artist may or may not be revealed during [this year's osu!catch World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025). Tune into [the Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) if you want to see it live!
