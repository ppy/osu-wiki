This year's Round of 16 is now behind us, and with it came the first of many eliminations to come.

This first elimination round marked the end of the journey for 8 teams. The stakes are slowly rising as we progress in the bracket and approach the middle of the tournament, with a lot of action going on every week. Let's have a look at how things went!

This week's mappool was once again full of custom maps for players to sink their teeth into. Despite the rising difficulty, all maps ended up with at least one FC this round. It might not sound especially impressive for a Round of 16, but given how much harder mappools have got these past years, it really showcases how much the average level of play in CWC has improved. As a point of comparison, a lot of these maps could have easily fit into a Semifinals mappool no more than 5 years ago. Everyone is improving, and the picks are keeping up.

Surprisingly, many of the tougher maps this week were of fairly low star rating. [Liyac](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4994598)'s [Lorikeet](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388187#fruits/5179986) served as this week's gimmick pick, featuring very unconventional patterning for what was arguably this week's hardest map. [ONIRIC](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388192#fruits/5168150) mapped by [Morusya](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13681464) had some of the most seasoned Hidden players struggling to maintain combo on a 4-star map, and the very low density of [Summer Vacation (Original Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388201#fruits/5168161) mapped by [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768) tripped up many players due to its precision and reading requirements with Hard Rock.

And to round off this round's mappool, our very own CWC advisor and head mappooler [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466)'s gave us his take on a streamy tiebreaker, on [Painters of the Tempest (Part II): Triptych Lux (Cut Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388223#fruits/5168189). At almost 7 minutes of drain time, this monster of a map features many tricky stream patterns and hyper-sliders that could challenge the consistency of even our very best players. Unfortunately, it didn't get to be showcased in a match this week, as no team was contested enough to reach the tiebreaker. You're free to give it a shot on your own though!

This past week featured this year's first [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals)! [XenjeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/482) made their CWC debut on [Planetary Exclusion Zone](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388185#fruits/5168126), mapped by [-Rustyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16355636) for the No Mod 2 slot. XenjeS' blood-pumping electronic style made for the perfect fit for this week's technical pick, only enhanced by the work from our illustrators and graphic designers. Check them out by either clicking on the banner right above, or checking out the showcase video below!

While the spectators and players only get to see the finished results for every original, a lot goes on behind the scenes for every single one of them. For this one, our head mappooler [wwwww](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466) gave us some insights on the process for naming the track and working on its background art.

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/wwwww.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-white" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8434466">wwwww</a></p>

[XenjeS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/482) didn't know what to name the track, and let in me and [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891) on coming up with name ideas. We sent him back a list, in which he decided on yoshi's idea of "Planetary Exclusion Zone or P.E.Z."

When Xenjes was asked about design ideas, he gave the following answer:

> The most logical thing is to operate from the song name. the song name is Planetary Exclusion Zone so we need something in space and maybe something futuristic. It can be for example composition with astronaut in free space looking at star/pulsar/quasar that being covered with sarcophagus or other type of construction that supposed to seal the energy of that object. Or it can be a composition of a place that filled with all kind of dangerous space objects like pulsars, quasars and black holes so "Exlucsion Zone" in the song name would make sense.

The artist sent a few working drafts, and made one directly referencing the sarcophagus, and the design assistants + [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) voted on the draft they liked the most (which was this one).

Tl;dr, its a sarcophagus that was sealing energy before the energy it was holding finally became too much to bear, and now acts as a black hole sucking in everything around it

This Round of 16 didn't feature as many close matches as the Round of 32, but it still had some interesting ones as well as a few surprises. Only eight teams remain undefeated in the winners' bracket, and nearly all of them are from the top 8 of Qualifier seedings, save for ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland at seed 10. 4 of them will drop out of it next week in the Quarterfinals, so be on the lookout for some elite play from these teams next weekend!

We only had a single upset this round, just like last week, with ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland (#10) triumphing over ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia (#7) in a convincing performance that resulted in a 6–2 win for them. Poland has had quite the roster change this year, losing some of their core players who managed to reach the podium last year. However, thanks to the sizeable pool of new talents being fostered in the country, the new roster still manages to perform and stay competitive in this edition. How far will their run bring them this year? It is all still left to be decided in the next couple of weeks!

So far the Qualifiers results are accurately predicting the outcomes of almost every match, but it's only a matter of time before things get shaken up, whether it is in the winners' or losers' bracket. With that being said, let's have a look at some highlight matches from this Round of 16!

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=SE }:: Sweden

Looking at the winners' bracket matches last week, most people didn't anticipate a very exciting encounter between the United States (#1) and Sweden (#16). The mappool, even this early, wasn't easy enough for the teams way lower seeded than their opponents to go for an upset. Surely, last year's champions and #1 seed wouldn't have any issues with the 16th seed, right?

Last year, the United States reached the Grand Finals week with only 2 points lost during their winners' bracket run, beginning with their 7–1 win against Chile during the Semifinals. Sweden, on the other hand, finished in top 24 last year, being eliminated in the Quarterfinals. They had already struggled to maintain themselves in the winners' bracket last week, narrowly advancing after a tiebreaker win against Peru.

Given all this, no one truly expected Sweden to be able to compete against the United States in this matchup. It was thus to everyone's surprise that they went and won their first pick, [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388183#fruits/5168115), with a double FC from ::{ flag=SE }:: [amni sd](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16669841) and ::{ flag=SE }:: [Shameimaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20340480). With that, the United States' perfect record was broken, with their flawless run unexpectedly coming to an end in this Round of 16.

The United States losing a point to Sweden, while unexpected, was also not something too shocking. With how good players have got, even lower-seeded teams are now able to compete and FC maps, leaving top teams with almost no margin for error. The United States brushed that off as a minor misstep and quickly refocused on their match, comfortably winning their next pick on [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388197#fruits/5168156) with a second double FC in a row from ::{ flag=US }:: [Lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149) and ::{ flag=US }:: [Secre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637).

Sweden tried again on their [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388341#fruits/5168359) pick, but let the first break point of the match slip away into the United States' favour. They were now down 2 points on their opponent's pick, and the match was going back to what one would expect of this matchup: a mostly one-sided victory from the United States. However, no one could have predicted what happened next.

The United States selected [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388193#fruits/5168151), the low AR Hidden pick, knowing what they're able to do on this map. ::{ flag=US }:: [Lexii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7226149) managed to get his third FC in a row and ::{ flag=US }:: [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006) got his second, but Sweden answered back with a double FC of their own from ::{ flag=SE }:: [amni sd](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16669841) and ::{ flag=SE }:: [Setomi79](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2205929) to win the point. Winning a single point against the champions was something, but a second one, and on their own pick? This match was getting intense, and the Swedish players were performing to the very best of their abilities.

And it didn't stop there, with Sweden following up with a mind-blowing 3-way FC on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388185#fruits/5168126) to win their own pick. It had been years since the last time the United States were contested like this so early in the bracket. However, champions don't become champions without strong mental resilience, and they went on to win the next 4 picks in a row, to close out the match 6–3. Even if they couldn't keep taking points from them, Sweden could be proud of their performance, as they gave the United States a battle that they're sure to remember for a while.

### ::{ flag=FR }:: France vs. ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada

Despite a 6–2 result, the winners' bracket match between France (#5) and Canada (#12) was definitely one of the craziest ones this week, as well as one of the most anticipated ones. Both teams have the potential to go for a deep bracket run, and neither wanted to drop to the losers' bracket this early on in the tournament.

France started out very strong, winning on Canada's [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388341#fruits/5168359) pick and setting the best team score of the week on it. This was thanks to a double SS from ::{ flag=FR }:: [Ttobas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2084568) and ::{ flag=FR }:: [Electr0o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9484428) on Hard Rock and Hidden respectively, matched only by ::{ flag=CA }:: [CTBWhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620002)'s own Hard Rock SS. France then went on to secure their breakpoint with a successful [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388193#fruits/5168151) pick.

At this point, the maps were fairly close between the teams, with each having the potential to win almost any pick depending on their performance. Canada barely managed to get on the board with their [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388201#fruits/5168161) pick, only winning by a ridiculously small 775-point difference. Matches like these tend to be the most stressful ones for both the viewers and players alike, as even a single spin can make the difference. Canada could finally breathe a bit, having secured both the point and their own pick. Surely no other pick will be this close... right?

France then went on to pick [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388187#fruits/5168130) and once again set a top team score, with ::{ flag=FR }:: [Electr0o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9484428) getting the only FC of the week on it. It was now up to Canada's turn to pick, and they decided to go for [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388200#fruits/5168160). And once again, on their second Hard Rock pick in a row, we would see a score difference of less than a thousand, this time decided by a mere 803 points of difference in favour of France.

What would be the nail in the coffin for Canada was France's next pick of [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118474861), the final Hard Rock map. The match couldn't have been more tragic for Canada even on purpose, as they would go on to lose this map by a whole **4 points**, one of the smallest score differences across all World Cups combined. France was now on match point, and despite Canada's successful [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388192#fruits/5168150) pick, they would manage to close out the match 6–2 on [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2388325#fruits/5168335) with another double FC from ::{ flag=FR }:: [Electr0o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9484428) and ::{ flag=FR }:: [Ttobas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2084568). Both players would end up being ranked as the #1 and #2 best performers of the round, as shown on the [statistics sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X1yRy2JXnWeeZPFa1voLP7EPifW2sQ11XvB56wKQpv8/edit?rm=minimal&gid=2090207382#gid=2090207382).

Had a few things gone slightly differently, this match could have had a completely different outcome. Canada ends up dropping to the losers' bracket, where they're sure to be a fierce opponent for anyone standing in their way, while France continues their winners' bracket run. Be on the lookout for both of these teams on the upcoming rounds, since they're both competitors looking to go very far in the tournament.

---

Another 8 teams will be eliminated next week, and some of the top teams will finally get to meet and offer us a show worth watching in the upcoming Quarterfinals.
