Returning for a fourth time, the UK's biggest meetup just keeps growing!

## How did EPIC44 go?

A huge turnout of top players and community members alike came to [EPIC44](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-27-osu-uk-epic44), with a stunning stage Finals topping off the run of show — seeds 1 and 2 ::{ flag=GB }:: [rudj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11592896/osu) and ::{ flag=GB }:: [Mahmood](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7627844/osu) faced off to a large crowd and the match was one of the most exciting Finals a LAN has seen, coming close to the insanity of EPIC43.

Check it out for yourself here:

## Awesome! When/where's the next one?

EPIC46 is located in **Leisure Arena, Kettering** and next runs from **30th October to 2nd November**, with the osu! tournament Qualifiers taking place for **BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) attendees** between 12:00 and 22:00 on Friday 31st. The **top 16 qualify** to play a single-elimination bracket the next day, battling for the chance to duke it out on stage with the potential to win hundreds of Great British Pounds and a lovely profile badge!

There are **already 40 players** seated and more to join, so if you missed COE for whatever reason and want to experience a high-energy community meetup environment, this is your chance to come hang out with like-minded individuals who love an excuse to nerd out about the game we all love. Plus, **other activities** run all weekend, with fun tournaments happening often and the **Finals of [chromb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10238680)'s osu!UK Taskmaster event** being presented **live on stage**!

Check out the [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2128267) for the relevant event/tournament links, and make sure to join the [osu!UK Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jTPAEgFUNz) for more information on the event and to see who else is in for the ride!

Looking forward to meeting you there!
