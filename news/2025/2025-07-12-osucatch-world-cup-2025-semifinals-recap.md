Last weekend, 12 teams played in the Semifinals round, but in the end, only 6 remain. At this point in the tournament, every single team still competing is a top contender looking to reach the very last stage of the tournament, and for the most ambitious, even aspiring to win it all in the end. Let's take a look at all that happened in the past week.

The Semifinals mappool was one of the biggest step-ups in difficulty in the tournament so far. It makes sense given the remaining teams, giving us an introduction to late-tournament pools. It started right away with [R.I.P.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395421#fruits/5188524) (NM1), mapped by [Zyzyx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2888013) and [Yoshi_Green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891), standing at a star rating of 7.95 and featuring intense and stamina-draining patterning for the full three and a half minutes. 

Surprisingly, in this mappool, we saw three mappers make their first ever CWC appearance, in [Cruwev](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12195994), [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395303#fruits/5188114), and [Zileni](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395287#fruits/5188086). Cruwev made a bold entrance onto the CWC scene with his [Big Daddy (Cut ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395283#fruits/5188079) (NM3) map, as the gimmick pick of the round. Cruwev's unconventional style mixed with a high Circle Size and a low Approach Rate made for one of the biggest standouts in the mappool, both in terms of difficulty and hype factor. Phob, first-time mappooler this edition, debuted not only with one, but two maps this round, those being [Yakujinsama no Couple Dance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395303#fruits/5188114) (HD2), and [Idolize](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395304#fruits/5188115) (DT4). Both feature the classic Phob flair, being full of unique ideas and unusual patterning. And finally, Zileni offered us [Deglaciation](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395287#fruits/5188086) (HR3), a more conventional but explosive mechanical Hard Rock pick for this round. New custom mappers are quite rare in the osu!catch scene, so it was a very pleasant surprise for everyone to see new faces coming in this round.

This round also featured the first [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187) appearances in both [Xabon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395292#fruits/5188099) (HD3) and [Necrotopia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395391#fruits/5188321) (TB), in collaboration with [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598). Having become a tournament staple as a mapper for the past couple of years, the osu!catch legend will also be present for this CWC, with each map more unique than the last.

Two weeks ago, the first [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals) of the tournament was revealed. Last week, two of them were featured in the mappool. And for this one... you guessed it right, three originals are here!

We started off strong with [SUTEGORO](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955) by [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220). Mapped by the Polish duo consisting of [Mniam](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6050530) and [Malai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4863096), the explosive math rock track was done justice, with a Hidden pick that caught many a player off-guard. Reflecting the calculated chaos of the instrumentals with a combination of repeated antiflows, inconsistent spacings, and 1/16 hyperwalks, the result is a pick that few players could properly keep up with, despite only strong teams remaining. Also make sure to check out the beautiful photography by [Amphy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10762223) and edited by [hourius](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12580298) for the background art!

It's Touhou Eurobeat time. Being a fairly uncommon genre in osu!catch, it was a pleasant surprise when [A-One](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/168) was revealed as the artist for one of this week's originals, [Side by Side](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395293#fruits/5188100). The high octane instrumentals accompanied by the classic A-One vocals combined into an infectious bundle of energy designed to set your fingers –and the floor– on fire. Mapped by [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284) and slotted in as a Mixed Mod pick, it would end up being a four-minute-long stamina gauntlet, full of stop-and-go patterns, with barely any breathing room for anyone playing it. [Peargor](https://www.youtube.com/@Peargor/videos) made an appearance to work on the illustration for the song and [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323) worked on the storyboard, so go check out the map to get the full Side by Side experience.

If you've been following the past few newsposts, you'll know that [Ice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/484), titan of rhythm game music, is now a Featured Artist. The bombshell was dropped during the mappool showcase for this round, revealing [Nostalgia Sonatina Op.3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395334#fruits/5188192) as an original, alongside the Featured Artist annoucement. Following the previous "Nostalgia Sonatinas" made for other rythm games, the third entry of the series would be for this CWC, featured as a Mixed Mod map by [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134). It focused mostly on mechanics, with many wiggles and stream patterns for the classic Ice piano melodies. Welcome to the Featured Artist lineup!

As we approach the end of the tournament, less and less matches are to be expected each round. However, it also means that every match is high-stakes, featuring two teams that managed to reach this point in the tournament facing off against each other. Currently, only two teams remain in the winners' bracket, those being last year's grand finalists, the United States and Argentina. Every other team in the tournament suffered a loss, and is now fighting in the losers' bracket.

Many top contenders were eliminated this round, such as ::{ flag=PL }:: Poland and ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada, respectively placing third and fourth last year, as well as the ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation, third seed this year. ::{ flag=ID }:: Indonesia, ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru, and ::{ flag=JP }:: Japan also dropped out, failing to reach the top 6. 

If you missed it, there was also a [showmatch between staff members](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2504289576?t=2h5m10s), featuring some big names in the scene, which ended in an intense tiebreaker. And it totally wasn't rigged or anything, contrary to what you might hear. It was tons of fun, so feel free to go check it out!

With that being said, let's look at some highlights of the round!

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=CA }:: Canada

Canada (#12) and the Russian Federation (#3) were two teams with very different runs in the tournament. Canada were sent down to the losers' bracket as early as the Round of 16 by France, but managed to stay in the tournament through their perseverance. As for the Russian Federation, they placed third in the Qualifiers, and dominated the winners' bracket until encountering Finland, who ended up winning thanks to their amazing consistency on the Quarterfinals pool. This Russian roster is arguably the strongest they've ever had, while Canada was trying to remain as strong a competitor as the previous years, just like last year when they placed fourth.

On paper, it was hard to predict what would happen this match, with both rosters starting to show weaknesses due to the scaling of the mappool. Canada was expected to perform on the gimmicky picks and Hidden, and the Russian Federation on the more mechanical picks. This is exactly what happened in the beginning of the match, with Canada going for [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118595017), [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395334#fruits/5188192), and [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955) and winning all of them, with a standout FC from ::{ flag=CA }:: [CTBWhiteCat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7620002) on MM3 with HR. The Russian Federation followed the plan, picking and winning [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395295#fruits/5188102) and [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395286#fruits/5188085).

At this point, both teams were just looking to get a breakpoint to get a lead in the match, and Canada would be the first to get one on what looked like a very solid [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395333#fruits/5188189) pick from the Russian roster. Canada knew that they weren't out of picks— this mappool featured many maps on the more unconventional side which they enjoyed playing around, like they did on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395283#fruits/5188079) next to secure the breakpoint. The Russian Federation won their [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395421#fruits/5188524) gamble, and even managed to win on Hidden against Canada on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395292#fruits/5188099) to get back to an even scoreline.

But in a devastating turn of events for them, they would fail to win on their own [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395291#fruits/5188098) pick by only about 18k points, letting Canada close out the match 5—7 on [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395304#fruits/5188115). Was it the picking strategy that failed the Russian Federation in the end, a couple too many misses, or just Canada playing great? It looked like a combination of all, but this loss meant that they were now out of the tournament, with the twelfth seed eliminating the third. Unfortunately for Canada, they would also end up being eliminated this round, losing to Chile 7—1. These last few rounds are unforgiving, and with them comes no shortage of broken hopes.

Poland (#10) and Chile (#9) faced off for the last time last year, in a very memorable losers' bracket Finals match that ended in Poland winning on the tiebreaker. This year, they would go against each other one round earlier in the same bracket, but with slightly different rosters. Both teams suffered from major player losses going into this edition, and wanted to prove that they were still able to compete with their current lineups. All in all, an exciting showdown between two evenly-matched teams was ahead of us.

As the match got going, both teams looked competitive on each other's picks. After successful first picks on each side, on [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395295#fruits/5188102) for Poland and [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395265#fruits/5187955) for Chile, the second ones would end up being breakpoints for the opposing team. [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395421#fruits/5188524) didn't favour Poland as they had hoped, and the very expected [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395292#fruits/5188099) pick coming from Chile would backfire against them despite the supposed Hidden weakness for Poland this year. But after that Poland would once again lose on their own pick, this time on [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395286#fruits/5188085), which wasn't the case for Chile who won [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395319#fruits/5188169). 

Poland had lost their edge in the match after two opportunities to keep the scoreline, and it was up to them to make up for it. However, as the match went on, no comeback would be seen from Poland. After barely winning on [DT2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395290#fruits/5188096), they would keep succeeding in their pick strategy by also taking [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395287#fruits/5188086) and [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395293#fruits/5188100). But just managing to win your own picks wouldn't be enough in this situation, as Chile would do the exact same on [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395334#fruits/5188192), [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395333#fruits/5188189), and finally [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2395291#fruits/5188098) when the timer ran out for Poland.

Each pick ended up being a nailbiter— would this be the map that Poland comes back on to bring themselves to a tiebreaker? Unfortunately, that moment they were now eliminated of the tournament by Chile, losing 5—7. Chile had now taken their revenge, and thanks to this win and their next one against Canada, they qualified for the Finals round, matching their performance from last year despite losing key players and playing in a more stacked CWC. Can they manage to push even further? Tune in to next week's matches to see!

This week's interviewee is [Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462), mappooler for the first time this edition, who also made his debut this round as a mapper. He gives us some insights on his approach to mappooling, and the process for this edition.

How would you introduce yourself to people not in the know?

Hi, I'm Phob. I'm a Polish osu!catch player and mapper. I've been actively participating or helping out in community projects and events for the past couple years. After placing 3rd in last year's CWC, I've decided to join the mappooling team.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

What does it take to create a good pool for CWC, and how does one evaluate whether a pool is good or not?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Phob.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462">Phob</a></p>

Out of all osu!catch tournaments, CWC is the only one with enough resources to create fully custom-made pools. As a result, good communication between mappers, poolers and testers, along with the ability to provide clear feedback and guidance is crucial in order to make a high quality pool.

Good balancing is arguably the most important, yet also the most difficult part to get right, so it is the first thing that needs to be checked. Before releasing the pool, we ask multiple playtesters to evaluate the maps' difficulty and give their feedback to reduce bias as much as possible. They also let us know whether the maps accurately represent their slots and test the intended skillsets well. Their work this year has been absolutely invaluable and I don't think we would've done so well without them.

To gain a sense of whether we are going in the right direction, we also analyze individual and team scores of players and take their direct feedback into account (given that it's stated clearly and wouldn't introduce any bias).

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

Are there any changes that separate this pool from previous years, or are you sticking to a tried and true formula?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Phob.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462">Phob</a></p>

We didn't introduce any major changes to skill requirements of each slot, but some definitions have been slightly altered as an attempt to better test those skills. Most notably, the HD pool, with maps that now include more non-uniform spacings and unconventional snappings, and the HR pool, featuring maps that don't avoid characteristic note randomization as much as they used to.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Walavouchey.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079">Walavouchey</a></p>

Did your previous experience as a player who reached the podium last year affect your experience as a mappooler?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Phob.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-lvd" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462">Phob</a></p>

Yes. It was the first time I got to experience the tournament as a key player on the Polish team, as well as the first time Poland managed to reach the Grand Finals. Since I had to spend time practicing every single map in every pool, I started to notice more and more issues arising with each round. Poor balancing, underrepresented skillsets, patterning choices that majorly hurt playability for the sake of emphasis or aesthetics (most notably, the infamous "1/8s") - these are the things I focused on preventing this year as much as I could.

</div>

---

We are now down to our last 6 teams, each one of them contending for a spot on the podium— save for the already guaranteed top 3 finishers, Argentina and the United States. Every match remaining is sure to be an amazing one, and the most intense rounds are about to start.

As usual, the [CWC wiki page](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025) will help you know when to tune in to [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) and [osulive_2](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive_2) to follow the action. Be sure to be there!
