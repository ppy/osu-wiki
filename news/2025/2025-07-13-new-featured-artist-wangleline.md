If you haven't heard **WangleLine** yet, your day is about to get a lot better.

German producer **WangleLine** is as prolific as one can be. With 14 albums created to date, plus tracks for the [osu!catch World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC), [Lazer Grand Arena](/wiki/Tournaments/LGA), and various [community tournaments](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music), **WangleLine** has developed a style that perfectly suits the needs of rhythm game players. (Given her background as both an [osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7994819) and a game developer, that shouldn't be a surprise.)

The latest addition to **WangleLine**'s ever-expansive discography is [Goodbye to Your Vicious Cycles](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2402735), the track produced specifically for [this year's osu!catch World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025) which debuted in today's mappool showcase!

That track (along with **22** others!) can be found on [**WangleLine**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/427), each paired with its own ultra-convenient pre-timed beatmap template.

When you're done admiring all of those maps, make your own by visiting [**WangleLine**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/427) and picking out the template for your favourite track. That's a command, not a recommendation.

New Featured Artist next weekend? Yessir, you know that's right.
