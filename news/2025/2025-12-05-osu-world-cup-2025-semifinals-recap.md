One of the greatest Cinderella stories in the history of the osu! World Cup tried to keep dancing while the tournament's strongest teams flexed their muscle in a stunning display of dominance. This was the Semifinals weekend of OWC 2025.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-05-osu-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap/banner.jpg)

The #16 seed New Zealand represented a fairytale story the likes of which had rarely been seen before in OWC, while each of the top 4 seeds jockeyed for position at the top of the bracket, competing for the two places in the winners' bracket Final and guaranteed placement on the podium.

Six teams would be sent home over the course of the week's eight matches; six teams would advance onward to the Finals week. Each of the remaining 12 teams had something to fight for, but who would be left alive by the time the dust settled?

[D I O](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3958619)'s video is once again available for those seeking a more visual recap of the action:

The Semifinals mappool had a lot of interesting maps to choose from. As usual, existing maps made their appearance, and ones such as [Dreadnought](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/48356#osu/149559), an old, classic map that went beyond 320 BPM on DT, and [Entangle Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2216137#osu/4697634), a recently Loved stamina gauntlet, provided the pool its tapping and mechanics base. Other maps, like the famous [Desert](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1417973#osu/2921554), a classic circle tech offering, and [Breathe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1223323#osu/2544530), a DT map that can be summarised as "osu! for ants", gave the pool some of its more technical and gimmicky aspects.

Of course, new customs also graced the pool this week, and [stairway to the universe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468655#osu/5405917) and [GIRL HELL 1999 (bye2 Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468634#osu/5405861) are some examples of them. The former is a tough HR precision challenge while the latter is a Free Mod offering which can be roughly described as challenging the exact opposite skill set, being CS 2.5. Other maps, such as [STRANGEPROGRAM](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468641#osu/5405871) and [Wakuwaku Tabemono Land](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468630#osu/5405851), were more conventional in a way, being a Hidden and Free Mod map respectively, both fortifying the mechanical side of the pool.

This week also had the debut of not one, not two, but three [osu! originals](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music)!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-05-osu-world-cup-2025-semifinals-recap/skywired_beatscape_banner.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468647#osu/5405883)

</div>

The first one, in the showcase order, is the great [steelplus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/514)' electronic symphony, [Skywired Beatscape](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468647#osu/5405883), a floating, rhythmically fun production, which housed an interesting and popular alt and light tech pick by [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) and [Megafan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6632605). One cannot understate the openness and even nostalgic nature of the song, and we urge you to give it a listen!

The second original was a project by one of our more unique and popular FAs, the amazing folks who comprise [Mili](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/331). They graced us with their distinctive sound on [Peach Pit and Cyanide](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468654#osu/5405912), a beautiful vocal piece that cannot be missed out on. To tackle the slower composition, the trustworthy [vetoed](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10909373) was put in charge, with the goal of creating a reading and aim map for the tournament, but also to create another, more conventional map for those outside of the tournament to enjoy as well. If you haven't yet, make sure to give any difficulty a play!

As for the third original: it's tiebreaker time! The wonderful people over at [ELFENSJóN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/69) were the ones in charge this time around, and they gave us the epically powerful J-rock song [Hexen Noir](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468665#osu/5405933), with the intense vocals of Hanatan, a voice immediately recognisable by most in the osu! community. With a great, mechanically challenging map by [seros](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10562853), [moph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2233878) and [Garden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2849992), which is already in Qualified, why not see if you're up for the challenge?

Those who have been following along throughout the tournament will be familiar with the story of New Zealand. With an overall ranking of #32 in the global standings and a base of under 8,000 active players, the heretofore unheralded Kiwis rarely appeared on the radar of casual fans. What's more, in their previous 12 OWC appearances, New Zealand had won a grand total of one match (in 2019), and in 2024, they finished a distant 44th in qualifiers, failing to make it to the bracket stage.

This year's roster, however, set out to write a new story for their tiny nation. Placing 16th in qualifiers and finishing with a 3–0 record in the Group Stage, New Zealand forced the world to sit up and take notice. Though they fell to the losers' bracket at the hands of the United Kingdom in the Round of 16, they won back-to-back matches in the Quarterfinals week over Sweden and France to solidify a spot for themselves in the top 12 for the first time. A matchup against #9 seed China loomed large with a top 8 placement on the line.

### ::{ flag=CN }:: China vs. ::{ flag=NZ }:: New Zealand

[**View the match information here!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/119951823)

<div align="center" class="osu-md__paragraph">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2630838540&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false&time=0h4m40s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

New Zealand got off to a quick start by winning their opening [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1015450#osu/2125262) pick by the bare margin of 69,912 points, then followed up with a break point on China’s [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468647#osu/5405883) led by ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Saiyku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13767572) and his 834,175 score for an early 2–0 advantage. China came storming back, starting with a break point of their own on [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468630#osu/5405851) as ::{ flag=CN }:: [lolol235](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6090175) put up a full combo to lead the way. China's captain continued his hot streak with a top score on [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2401973#osu/5209054) to tie the match, after which China would sneak another break point by a mere 18,985 points on the precision pick [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468655#osu/5405917) for a 3–2 advantage.

Just like last week against France, though, New Zealand had the answers; despite dropping three consecutive maps to give up the early lead, they came roaring back. First was a break point on the tech pick [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1417973#osu/2921554) with ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Saiyku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13767572) and ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Kyujin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15293080) putting up massive scores of 822,093 and 795,256. Next, ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Kyujin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15293080) dropped an FC on the stamina-intensive [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2216137#osu/4697634) to help New Zealand retake the match lead 4–3.

With momentum now firmly established, the team battled their way to a break point on China's [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468641#osu/5405871) pick. Match points in hand, they selected the ultra-speedy [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/48356#osu/149559). ::{ flag=NZ }:: [HaSappy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11518376) topped the lobby with a full combo, ::{ flag=NZ }:: [ozbert](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23179637), ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Kyujin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15293080), and ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Saiyku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13767572) backed him up with solid scores of their own, and New Zealand took the point and the match by a final score of 6–3.

It was a step into uncharted territory for New Zealand. Their previous best result in the modern era had been 17th–24th, and they now found themselves in the rarefied air of the top 8. A remarkable story was being written, but NZ had their sights set even higher, as the fearless squad next took on seed #5 and historical OWC behemoth Germany for a spot in the top 6.

### ::{ flag=DE }:: Germany vs. ::{ flag=NZ }:: New Zealand

</div>

Germany was not without its share of concerns in the Semifinals week: ::{ flag=DE }:: [Tim Kackner](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14385814) experienced computer issues ahead of their match on Saturday against Chile and they were missing key member ::{ flag=DE }:: [yary](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13300203) for the entire weekend. Though they managed to defeat Chile by the relatively routine scoreline of 6–3, the threat posed by New Zealand was a very real one despite the seeding discrepancy between the teams.

Yet another back-and-forth match ensued. The teams won their respective first picks, but Germany would strike quickly with a break point on [FM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468661#osu/5405928) as ::{ flag=DE }:: [okinamo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3765989)'s Hidden score of 831,658 was just enough for a 7,259-point win. It was off to the races for Germany, with the team winning three of the next four points to take a 5–2 lead and match point in hand to try to finally send Cinderella home from the ball.

New Zealand, though, had a roster that would never give up. First, ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Kyujin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15293080) and his 866,278 score on [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468630#osu/5405851) earned the team their long-awaited first break point of the match, then he and ::{ flag=NZ }:: [Saiyku](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13767572) each got FCs on the team's final pick of [FM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2216137#osu/4697634) to bring the score to 5–4. Germany was down to the final pick in the match and their last opportunity to close it out before a tiebreaker. Germany’s glory days in the early 2020s were brought to mind as they chose the classic aim pick of [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1611987#osu/3291179), and it was ::{ flag=DE }:: [criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659) captaining the ship as his 685,407 performance proved to be the difference-maker for Germany to finish off the match 6–4.

Germany is headed to the Finals week once more: 2025 marks their 12th straight year reaching at least the top 6, a remarkable legacy of consistent performance. Meanwhile, New Zealand headed home with heads held high. They had reached previously unimaginable heights in the osu! World Cup, stealing the hearts of viewers around the world in the process, and had proved that they were a force to be reckoned with.

The story of the Semifinals weekend cannot be told without mentioning the feats of dominance displayed by several of the top teams. In the winners' bracket, highly anticipated matchups between the #2 seed United States and #3 Australia in the lower half and #1 seed Poland and #4 Canada in the upper half tantalised viewers. Instead of the tightly contested battles that were expected, two full-on routs ensued.

The United States was up first, putting on a clinic as they achieved the [top score of the weekend](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PGtU-gy2raE34JNiXzhViN7Mw9AA0X65uiKosWbfpxo/edit?rm=minimal&gid=744483516#gid=744483516) on every map they played en route to a 6–0 blowout of Australia. Every map was a highlight for the U.S. in this match: whether it was ::{ flag=US }:: [tekkito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7075211) FCing [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1015450#osu/2125262), ::{ flag=US }:: [WindowLife](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4108547) with an FC on [FM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468630#osu/5405851), or OWC rookie ::{ flag=US }:: [EthantrixV3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10634348) doing the same on both [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468654#osu/5405912) and [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468634#osu/5405861), the U.S. displayed an absolute masterclass.

Not to be outdone, Poland came into the final match of the week against Canada ready to prove why they were the #1 seed. It was the ::{ flag=PL }:: [MALISZEWSKI](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) show in this one-sided affair as he dropped FCs on [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1417973#osu/2921554), [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1015450#osu/2125262), and [FM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468634#osu/5405861), finishing as the [top performer of the week](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PGtU-gy2raE34JNiXzhViN7Mw9AA0X65uiKosWbfpxo/edit?rm=minimal&gid=672041497#gid=672041497) with an absurd 1.932 performance score while playing all seven maps as Poland waltzed to a 6–1 win.

Last but certainly not least, the remaining team to make it to the Finals week from the losers' bracket was defending champion South Korea. The Koreans had been ingloriously deposited in the losers' side of things at the hands of Australia a week prior, but they did not miss a beat, dropping just 2 maps on the way to matching 6–1 victories over Norway and the Russian Federation. ::{ flag=KR }:: [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078) was at his best, earning a 1.672 performance score for the week while playing 12 of 14 total maps, and South Korea appeared poised for another deep run in OWC as they made their way into the top 6 for the 5th year in a row.

A song's emotions can feel even stronger when its illustrations bring the story to life. For the Semifinals tiebreaker, [Hexen Noir](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2468665#osu/5405933), that responsibility fell to three illustrators: [-pineapple-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326), [Saturn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22001295), and [sooky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8397914), each crafting their complete scene inspired by the song's dark fantasy narrative.

Welcome to the group interview! You've each taken different paths to get here. Both -pineapple- and Saturn have been involved in many World Cup projects in the past, while this is sooky's first time joining the lineup. To start things off, please introduce yourselves and share a bit about your experience as illustrators in the community.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-pineapple-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326">-pineapple-</a></p>

Hi, I'm -pineapple- and I've been making artworks for World Cups since TWC 2023 with [Sigrdrifa](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1981053#taiko/4113613), as well as for other tournaments such as The Perennial, Battle of the Box, GTS and JOKE. You may also know me from the backgrounds of [Echoes of Memoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2214238#osu/4691422) by Ludicin or [AKARI BEAM CANNON LAST BOSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2095159#osu/4393042) by Kommisar.

This is the 18th project I've worked on for osu!, and I feel really lucky to have had so many opportunities. I've been an osu! player for longer than I have been drawing, and I've been using the tablet that I bought specifically for playing osu! to draw. It's been really cool to see how much the production for tournaments have grown within the last few years, and I'll never stop being impressed by the insanely talented artists and musicians that osu! has worked with.

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22001295" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/CMDR_Saturn.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22001295">Saturn</a></p>

Hello! I'm Saturn, and I've been drawing for World Cups for just over two years. Outside of osu!, I work as an artist and contractor for some gacha games and just draw whatever inspires me personally. I've been a big fan of osu! originals, and it was [SICK ROCK CRAZY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1838305#osu/3774993) from Corsace Open 2022 that really made me think it'd be cool if my art is featured in original songs too.

Eventually, [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) came across my art in a Discord server and invited me to draw for osu! originals. Since then, I've contributed to several projects, including [seatrus - Disanimate](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2137728#mania/5139638), [Kou! - Frost Walker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202823#fruits/4662299), [Minstrel - Today is the Day](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2281434#osu/4864081), and [Krimek - Dahlia (feat. eili)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2412294#osu/5238714), with more to come in the future.

Hello, I'm sooky and it has been a pleasure to work on such a cool project and I'm grateful to have been granted this opportunity. It's the first time I've worked on a project to this scale in general, and I hope I can participate in more stuff in the future! I don't have much experience as an illustrator in osu!, however, to my knowledge there is one map that used my artwork and that is [Windswept](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2163039#mania/4561716) by [Cuzime](https://soundcloud.com/cuzime) & [Nstryder](https://soundcloud.com/nstryder) (mapped by [MapRequester](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6969823)). Cuzime is a good friend of mine and that song is our very first collaboration. Please check out his music and the map if you are an osu!mania 4K player :) Shoutout to Nstryder and MapRequester as well!

Tiebreaker projects often involve multiple illustrators, but the work distribution was split. We often had one illustrator drawing just the characters while others focused on backgrounds and supporting assets. This time, each of you worked on complete illustrations from character to environment. What was this experience like? Did this approach give you more room to explore your own styles while still collaborating as part of the larger team?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/-pineapple-.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-no-group" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11523326">-pineapple-</a></p>

Making separate illustrations gave us a lot of freedom in terms of direction, but despite this the storyboarders managed to bring everything together really well and into a full, coherent story. It really can't be understated how well [LowGraphics](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5383942) and [Iyouka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138499) brought it all together. For me, the best part about collaborating like this is that it lets me observe the workflow of all these ultra powerful god tier artists, so I can learn how they do things and incorporate into my own workflow in the future. It's really inspiring to get to work alongside such talented people.

I think our strengths played very well together despite doing separate illustrations. sooky excels at portrait drawings while pineapple's art has a unique abstract flair, and I focus more on compositions and storytelling. By drawing what we were good at, we were able to stick to our styles and piece together a storyboard that goes well with the music. For example, having sooky's portraits for the chorus, my backgrounds and characters for bridges, and pineapple's art for the guitar solo.

This was a very interesting experience! I'm thankful to get feedback from the GOAT artists Saturn and -pineapple-. Their input really helped me design the alter ego version of ELISIA, which was just a slightly modified version of the original design. It was really cool seeing how she looked in their respective styles in the end. We were basically given free reign to take the illustrations however we liked as long as it fits with the song's lyrics and dark fantasy theme. I think we all understood the assignment and our illustrations ended up harmonizing together pretty well.

While ELISIA's character design was provided by ELFENSJóN, each of your illustrations captured a different emotion and moment. Were there aspects of her design or the lyrics that you personally feel connected with? How did those early inspirations shaped your choice of character and scene layout? Are there perhaps any details in your illustrations that you hope players to notice when they see it in-game?

My illustration was planned to be used as the last scene, so I wanted to create a more lonely atmosphere with the alter ELISIA resting amongst red flowers in a desolate setting. Initially, I planned to draw the scene in the ruins of the castle in Saturn's illustration, but after a few iterations I decided to go for a more abstract structure which is heavily inspired by [nanomorits](https://x.com/Nan0Mortis), an artist I'm sure every osu! player is super familiar with.

The final few lyrics of the song portrayed ELISIA as a red, blooming flower in a hopeless and doomed world, so I wanted the strong red and sharp shapes to push this harshness. My illustration was a lot messier in this project since I wanted to keep the rougher feeling, so I hope players don't zoom in too far to see my mistakes!

I always want my art to be thoughtful, not just a character standing there looking pretty. My first impression of the lyrics was someone who has been stained and cursed by their past, reaching out for someone or something to fill the growing guilt within them. So in my main illustration, I drew a castle with unsettling red accents to set the scene of a fantasy world under a dark spell.

I also included books, orbs, candles, things you would associate with curses, longing for the past, etc. I placed floating mirrors all facing each other to symbolize confronting the twisted fragments of one's past. In the center I have ELISIA being grasped by a alter ego version of her past emerging from the mirror, with multiple arms and wings with eyes to show something beyond the mortal plane and apocrypha. In my second illustration, I focused on a close-up of the two characters in front of the mirror.

My illustration was built around the lyrics where ELISIA couldn't look away from the past despite knowing what is done cannot be undone. I wanted to portray ELISIA still treading forward with a burning passion. This is the part I felt most personally connected with as it accurately describes my relationship with creating art. Fire, loneliness, and lingering past were key words I thought about when I was drafting up my piece, which naturally led to the vibrant red colors I used.

Overall, I think my drawing was pretty straightforward haha. Usually my art style is pretty messy so I had to really lock in knowing that it would be zoomed in a lot in the [intro video](https://youtu.be/_aiV-u_bMf4) done by [Sakura006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10365024) and [dimavh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15056040). I hope players can appreciate the details of the hair because I spent a really long time on it :p
