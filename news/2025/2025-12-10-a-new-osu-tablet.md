If you've been on the hunt for a tablet, our new collaboration with **Wacom** has you covered.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-10-a-new-osu-tablet/main.jpg)

At the beginning of this year, [we brought **intro osu!tablets** to the store](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-02-12-osu-tablets-return). These are budget-friendly tablets with a caveat: they have higher-than-ideal input latency and lower-than-ideal precision for competitive circle clicking.

osu! players have always claimed that **Wacom** is the best source for competitively viable tablets, so...

</div>

**Wacom** helped us create the [**pro osu!tablet**](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448) with noticably lower input latency and higher precision than our [intro model](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1447)!

[When we initially announced this as a "pro" tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-02-12-osu-tablets-return#pro-tablet), our goal was to differentiate it from the "intro" version, however some people's expectations soared into the realm of fully customised tablet mechanics. While we'd love to do that, **Wacom** wasn't able to adjust their production process specifically for osu!. We're not done working with **Wacom** though, so we hope that'll change one day!

To be clear, the [pro tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448) is an osu!-themed version of **Wacom**'s extremely popular `CTL-472` model. For the tablet junkies out there, our version actually has [its own model name](/wiki/shared/news/2025-12-10-a-new-osu-tablet/CTL472KOSU.jpg)!

Technically speaking, the [pro tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448) includes more than *just* a tablet. Here's everything that it comes with:

Depending on who you live with, your pen may often find its way from your desk to your floor. Luckily the [pro tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448)'s tag also acts as a pen carrier!

Just like the [intro tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1447), the new [pro tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448) had its cover designed by the one and only [meiikyuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1043627). In unison, everyone please say "thank you meiikyuu."

What's necessary to start playing maps with the [pro tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448)? If you're running osu!(lazer), it'll work as soon as you plug it in. On osu!(stable), you'll need to grab drivers online. We recommend [OpenTabletDriver](https://opentabletdriver.net/) (which is built into the lazer client!).

One more thing to note: **the [pro tablet](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448) will not be restocked**.

This isn't a ploy to pressure you into buying a tablet. We won't run out of inventory any time soon, especially since we're too late for much of the holiday rush. Rather, we hope to be working with **Wacom** on production for a different tablet by the time stock hits zero!

Whenever you're ready to grab a tablet (or simply support the game), head to [**the store page**](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1448). 

See you next time!
