As we celebrate the Spring Festival and the Year of Snake, the longest-running annual beatmapping contest for novice mappers is back again!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-01-29-newspaper-cup-2025/banner.jpg)

The Newspaper Cup is originally a Chinese mapping contest to promote novice mappers, which had its first iteration in 2015. Through the past years, the Newspaper Cup has become a renowned contest for encouraging fresh blood into mapping and finding new talents across the entire mapping community, and it will always be the core value of Newspaper Cup.

Newspaper Cup 2025, the 11th occurrence of this annual event, will be hosted by ::{ flag=CN }:: [Mafumafu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3076909), ::{ flag=CN }:: [Fycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876867), and ::{ flag=CN }:: [Atrue](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1758523). We strongly encourage and welcome novice mappers to participate!

- Your submission should comply with the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria), except for those that cannot apply (e.g. spread requirements).

- You must complete your submission independently. Do not upload or share your submission with others before the results announcement.

  - You are not a winner of other osu! mode mapping contests (e.g., PDC, NPC, MBC, oBWC, etc.).

### Judging criteria

| Category | Details |
| :-: | :-- |
| Expertise (50%) | Expertise refers to how well the map reflects the music elements, with an emphasis on music reflection, pattern/rhythm consistency, coherence, and playability. As NPC is for novice mappers, judges will focus more on solid fundamental execution as the very first objective. |
| Creativity (35%) | Creativity refers to how the map stands out compared to current mapping trends and other submissions to this NPC. Generic maps or copy-paste concepts are discouraged. Creativity built on top of solid expertise is more than important as well. |
| Judge's Impression (15%) | Judges can award or deduct points based on specific noteworthy aspects as they deem appropriate, such as outstanding sections and hitsounds or vice versa. |

Submissions are anonymous to judges, and the judging scores will be standardised.
