It's that time of the month again — Project Loved is back with yet another set of bangers!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved-2.jpg)

Welcome back to Project Loved! If you are not aware of what this is, Project Loved hosts community polls every month, with [captains of each respective game mode](https://loved.sh/contributors) choosing maps, and the community choosing whether those maps get promoted to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved)!

You can click on the beatmap banner to go straight to the voting for each pick, or browse all the picks directly on the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). Be sure to submit your votes in time though, as voting only lasts for 10 days! As always, more details can be found on the [wiki](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) and the [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh).

Want to see your favourite map loved, or even submit a map of your own? Feel free to submit your map on the [website](https://loved.sh), and the captains might just include it in an upcoming month!

Interested in last month's results? You can find them below:

As for Project Loved news, this month we are saying goodbye to two osu! captains, [Librarian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084) and [mule kick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380) (better known as Wixonater and Aistre). We would like to thank both of them for stepping up and serving the community for four and two years, respectively. Their efforts are appreciated, and we wish them the best in their osu! journey!

As for the osu!catch side of the community, [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265) is putting up their coat and letting the "new kids on the block" take over. As one of the longest standing members with **6 years** under their belt, their last action before leaving the team was assisting the team with the recently announced captain applications we announced last month. Speaking of the applications, the captains are still deliberating, and will have the results ready as soon as possible.

Do you *love* Project Loved, like a lot? We've got good news for you, you can play all of this month's picks on [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer) and compete with all of your friends and rivals for the top spot on each mode's leaderboard! If you manage to clinch yourself the first place in any mode's leaderboard, you will earn yourself a month of sweet [supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support).

Let's cut the chit-chat, and get into the picks!

The first approach circle is served.\
A jump, one more, but you're already warmed up.\
The pace starts to pick up, and your penhold tightens.\
Cross-screen patterns start slamming in, and there's no room to breathe.\
You're thrown for a loop with unrelenting smashes.\
*"It's only 33 seconds a set."*\
There's no time to think, only to react.\
You prepare to receive and lob.\
**Game on.**

*description written by [Skill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7802027)*

The Second Popular Playcount for this month is [beaver](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14719475)'s multi-BPM set of [30 Seconds to Mars - Bury Me GAMMA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1483447#osu).

If you're familiar with the other multi-BPM tapping maps we have in loved like [Midorigo Queen Bee](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1036855#osu/2167822) or [Gate Openerz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1435435#osu/2972134), then you would have a good idea of what this map contains: streams and bursts with little aim; pure tapping shred. There's a difficulty to test your tapping abilities for *most*, 183, 206, 220, 247, 275 and 300 BPM difficulties. Gathering over 450,000+ plays and 350+ favourites, it clearly shows me that it belongs here in Project Loved.

If you think this map should enter a Loved state, cast your vote now!

HOOD CLASSIC ALERT 🗣️ 🔥 HOOD CLASSIC ALERT 🗣️ 🔥 HOOD CLASSIC ALERT 🗣️ 🔥

If you've lived through 2016 and didn't listen to this song you missed out on a huge classic. This map was submitted in 2016 and was very ahead of its time. It definitely deserves to be checked out.

This map is very good, this is true, but also one of the main reasons I'd like to see this reached Loved status is to pay my tributes. While the host of this map might not be with us any more, his legacy will forever live as one of the best Italian mappers from the old era of osu!.

May you rest in peace, [Diasios](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25999), also known as xxheroxx.

UYAMUYA MECHAKUCHA NI SHITE MO MADA 🗣️

This month's *Ranked Rejects* pick is [Neverland](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1048732#osu) mapped by FuJu, a 2019 mapset that didn't make it to ranked back in the day.

This is a very simple aim mapset that the vast majority can enjoy. After multiple complaints about this not being ranked, I think at least giving it a leaderboard in the Loved section is worth it.

So if you like simple & fun maps, do not forget to vote YES for this pick!

This beatmap was the winning entry in the first edition of "[Just Another Beatmap Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/612915?n=1)"; however, it's far from just another beatmap. [firing effect](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/641211#osu/1359734) is a tricky gimmick map with irregular aim control and incredibly high slider velocities!

Don't forget to vote YES for this beatmap in this month's voting polls!

Wait... this isn't `#mappool-feedback`...

This month's second Wildcard pick brings us a fan-favourite: [Yunosuke feat. okaki - True Novel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1823086#osu/3740872), crafted by the familiar duo [nooj](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271086) and [Weoweet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16861790). Time to run it through the NM4 checklist and see if this map really lives up to the hype.

- Slider tech and aim control ✅\
- Tricky flow cuts and dynamic rhythm choices ✅\
- Insane song ✅\
- Mapped by Halgoh, NeilPerry, or Mir ❌

Well... doesn't look like it passed the tournament checklist this time... but it could pass Loved if you vote yes!

osu! needs more "unforgiving maps on classical songs" — is that a category? I'd like to think so; a niche one, at least!

[virkato's *"Waltz of the Big dogs"*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/727186) by [Kaifin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2596942) and [melloe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2367616) isn't an exception to that. It's rare to see a rhythm map that displays ruthlessness while also being delicate, and I think this map does it well. Every note feels like it is placed with the intention of making you feel like you're playing the piano itself. Deceptively placed at 8.18★, this map is filled with jumpstreams and patterns that show no mercy. The question is: do you have what it takes to be a maestro?

After nearly 9 years, we're bringing this back from the grave and giving it a chance here in Project Loved. If you like classic DragonForce-esque CS 5 stream maps from \~2015, like [Defenders](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/323059#osu/718156), [Operation Ground and Pound](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/324171#osu/720314) or [Cry Thunder](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/316050#osu/704360), this is the perfect map for you. At 7.08★ and 5:30 drain time with no breaks, this map will be perfect to test your stamina, consistency and precision. Just like those old DragonForce maps, there are plenty of streams and even cut streams to catch you off guard, and just like mentioned earlier, CS 5 makes this much more difficult.

I have to bring out the classics for this one.

D Rank: Strong Survivor\
C Rank: Proud Stream Master\
B Rank: True Champion\
A Rank: Legend above Legends\
S Rank: osu! GOD? This is really impossible.

Starting off this month, we've got a very unique map from [Asagi Mutsuki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2403621), also known as cdh! In the song, the vocalist, Hoshimiya Toto, encounters her edgy self, Yorumiya Toto, and all sorts of shenanigans happen throughout this short 3-minute period.

With constant BPM and genre switches, Asagi Mutsuki manages to bring an interactive gameplay experience in [Kijibato - Shikkoku to no Kaikou (feat. Hoshimiya Toto)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1352124#taiko/2799207). The hitsounds work perfectly with the song, and the various SV switches spice up the map and bring distinction to each of the song's genre switches. Not to mention the map's relatively lower star rating. We hope every single one of you taiko gamers, whether you're a beginner or a top player, are able to enjoy this map.

This map not only has the recognition of several of your favourite mappers' favourite mappers, but also gained the attention of Hoshimiya Toto HERSELF on [X](https://x.com/hoshimiya_toto/status/1352134918386511874) (formerly Twitter), which is not some easy feat amongst osu! mappers. If you're looking for a silly map to play for this month's Loved playlist, look no further, as the Loved team is here to provide just the right dose of silliness for your desire!

All tech fans assemble!!!! Because this month's Project Loved nominations have everything you ever wanted.

[Genius(Yonosuke Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1996134#taiko/4148533) by [Shamirin_mzk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11325757), a mapper who you may know from their extremely creative gimmick maps, is a map which you can safely call a tech player's dream come true. This relatively low bpm track has a ton of variety, making room for Shamirin to channel their inner creativity. From 1/8 and 1/6 bursts to swing doublets and finisher sections.

This map was also featured in the [osu!taiko World Cup 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2024) as the Quarterfinals challenge No Mod pick!

Are you ready to conquer this map's low-SV sections with Hidden or the high-SV technical burst sections with Hard Rock? Or maybe you'll just stick to No Mod...

Anyway, this map can be enjoyable however you like, and if you'd like to see it Loved make sure to cast your vote this month!

*description written by [Gamelan4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9856910)*

The osu!taiko community tends to really love and engage with "map series". Maps whose characteristics are very clear, and are often the trademark of long time mappers. Fierce Forces, Raidcores, Ishida xi maps, you name them. "nass" maps, by [nananass](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7231722) are also a well-known map series, and honestly, it's been a while since the Loved section has seen one of them around to function as a benchmark for all those pro players, craving for a challenge.

While there are several nass maps out there more challenging than [Ayase Rie - Hi Jitsuzaikei Joshi Tachi was Dousurya Iidesuka?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/815190#taiko/1709730), the playcount this one has is no surprise. For quite some time, this map has worked as a starting point, as a rather harsh welcome to the brutal world of nass maps, a world often reserved for the most skilled in the game.

Being the first nass map passed by several players, giving it a leaderboard sounds like an excellent way to preserve such an achievement, so in the future you can look back and see what you have accomplished over the years.

This month, I present a map by [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501), who made significant contributions as a staff member during this year's [EGTS 2025](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-06-expert-global-taiko-showdown-2025-concludes)!

[CUN7 - my love for you will begin after i kill you](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1692985#taiko/3459492) is the speed map picked for NM2 at the SGTS2022 Finals, a fast-moving map that matches the atmosphere of the breakcore!!

Can you hit 2,000 objects in about 3 minutes? If you can pass this map with mods on... It's too scary ;^;

*your love for [ekumea1123](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119501) will begin after you vote this... vote... now...*

Barlines + Sliders = Magic!

Camellia and Nanahira go as well together as... well, Nozdormu and gimmicks! A well-established name in the osu!taiko tournament scene, [Nozdormu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7169208) is perhaps best known for his gimmick maps across multiple tournaments. Custom-made for [TART3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1721107) and used also in [NTC2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1774894), [Camellia feat. Nanahira - Mathematics MA+MA = Magic!](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1976920) is a barely 2-minute-long map, chock-full of various barline & slider gimmicks. This energetic and chaotic song is well represented by the sheer density and constant swapping of gimmicks to keep you on your toes!

Whether you're an intermediate player looking for some gimmick practice, or just a Nanahira enjoyer™, don't forget to vote yes!

Do I hear Ludicin? And GTS? AND 300 BPM?

That's right, this month I present to you [Onus Regulus](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2036523#taiko), composed by [Ludicin](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/459). Nominating GTS maps is almost starting to feel like a tradition now, but it's not often that a GTS original song is used twice in their tournaments. Let's take a look at what [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766) managed to cook for us this time around:

**COEGTS 2023 NM2 - Against Overwhelming Odds (7.25★):** The original rendition used at [the first GTS LAN tournament](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023) in 2023 pooled as the speed pick for the main mappool. The map opens up with a tricky stream section, and from then continues to be a relatively tame speed map utilizing typical Nwolf patterning.

**EGTS 2025 GF NM6 - The Fallen King's Precipice (8.73★):** The harder secondary map in the set. The real deal. 300 BPM is simply too easy for EGTS' Grand Finals speed map standards, so why not transform the original difficulty into a stream map? This map is absolutely relentless when it comes to density and stamina-draining patterning. Do deathstreams sound too easy for you? No problem, Nwolf anticipated that and decided to throw in some 1/6 450 BPM patterns too.

So, what do you think? Does this map deserve a spot in the Loved category? Then make your voice heard through voting!

[Oishi Masayoshi - Kamiari Algorithm (feat. Lilia.) (katagiri bootleg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1450193#taiko/2981550), made by [Waribashi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2250574) and [7_7](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7491106), is a simple map that can be enjoyed by beginners and experts alike. The overall map structure is calm at 5.76★ and 200 BPM, and although there are some 1/6 patterns, it is a map that can be played comfortably all the way through. It is a map that showcases both mappers' characteristic ability to get into the groove of the song through their mapping styles.

We hope you will try it and see for yourself!

[ONE NOTES - Shadow and Truth (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/929332#taiko/1940956) mapped by [HiroK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4050738) is a map that may appear easy on the surface to some due to it being 3.73★ and 121 BPM. However, [Shadow and Truth](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/929332#taiko/1940956) brings a unique challenge! With the majority of the map having 0.3x or 0.35x SV, the low BPM poses more of a challenge as notes are incredibly close together and rhythms or even what note comes next become harder to discern, shifting the main difficulty of this map from hitting the notes to reading what is coming next!

For those looking to push their reading even further, [Shadow and Truth](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/929332#taiko/1940956) was featured in the [Taiko Suiji Cup 2023](https://gtsosu.com/2023/tsc/home) Round of 32 mappool in the EZ slot, making the notes even more bunched up and requiring even more focus!

Good luck and Enjoy!

Anyway, you ever wonder what happens when you mix a game from the 2000s and a broken pp farm map? I did, and you're about to find out.

[twierdza 98](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2111334#taiko) is a mash-up of everyone's beloved *Sandstorm* and everyone's hated [navi 98](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1856862#taiko), with a touch of an absolute classic — *Stronghold: Crusader*. This remix is also very special due to it being made by the mapset host himself — [knibblet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6922240)!

Exhibiting a total of 12 taiko difficulties ranging from 5 to 10 stars, you're bound to find a difficulty tailored perfectly to your skill level. Most of the mappers are also part of the [#1 Sigma Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/teams/4112), and as far as gameplay gimmicks go, they got you covered. Streams? Finishers? SV? You name it! This set has it all.

And as always, if you want to see this masterpiece in Loved, don't forget to show up to the monthly polls!

Another Dan is joining the Loved section, but you might be confused about why. We already have Emiru's version, though? Well, the reasoning is because this one follows a completely different format and focuses on different skillsets! In Rocma's version here, to clear each difficulty, you need to get a 96%! Sounds pretty forgiving, right? Nope! Every dan increases difficulty a lot more than the previous dan version, so if you were 10th dan in Emiru's version, you won't be even close to 10th dan in this version.

Lastly, each map is split into the following four skillsets: jumps (overall skills on wide spacing or consecutive dashes), tech (unorthodox flows or complicated snaps which are giving unconventional experience), speed (rapid movements or reading skill on high density snaps) and finally consistency (stamina on continuous patterns which force unceasing movements).

Good luck to everyone!

Even on No Mod, this map provides early access to stream patterns that you don't really see until harder maps, while being at a much easier base.

The man. The myth. The legend. It is time for my all-time saviour to come onto the stage.

[awdse22](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8743513) — which I believe is pronounced "odyssey twenty-two" (I may be making this up) — has probably saved my figurative posterior more times than they realise. Well, myself among many others within the tournament community. If you take a gander at their map roster, you may notice that a lot of it is centered around 2024. Within that year, those maps are only the tip of the iceberg regarding the contributions they made.

To start things off, I think awdse22 might be unconventionally one of the best SV players the world has ever seen. That unique skillset within an already unique skillset grants them a very particular vision when translated into a mapping canvas. [fffff](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130598#mania/4480870) does a pretty good job of showcasing why that's the case.

Featured in the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup 2024 Semifinals stage](/wiki/Tournaments/4DM/2024), *fffff* is essentially a crash course in pattern telegraphing: what you have to play on the fake stops is teased by the patterning before it, and it's pretty easy to grasp the concept of the map at a glance. However, the execution will require you to tune your brain differently, and that's where the magic of SV lies.

Are you ready to fffffinally bring this fffffile to the Loved roster? Fffffire away!

[Come Inside My Heart (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1943116#mania) is quite the relaxing song, especially when you are listening to it on a rainy day, however, this chart has a lot of challenging patterns, as [Reyi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13385865) makes his first appearance in the Loved Category!

To start things off, despite this "calm" mood for a song, a lot of the chart's difficulty comes in the form of speed. At the very beginning, it greets you with light jumpstreams, until it suddenly hits you with a short break including some bits and pieces of streams. Once that is done, this chart starts to give you the true challenge, which are continuous stream patterns.

There are a few break sections here and there, but consistency is key throughout this chart. The challenge really comes in the form of being able to maintain your speed while going fast, hitting two note anchors, and reducing the amount of greats, goods, and bad judgments all throughout.

It's no surprise that this chart at 1.05x rate was featured in the [osu!mania 4K World Cup 2023 edition for the Round of 16 mappool](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K#round-of-16). Speaking of which, rates up to 1.2x exist, and I'm very sure that many players would love to see how they stack up against the rest of the world.

Do you want to see more charts like this in Loved? As someone from the Philippines, seeing songs like this from my country being charted is quite a surprise! Nevertheless, if you really like speed charts and Filipino songs, then this chart is definitely for you to vote "Yes" on in Project Loved!

[Eclipse-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8493070) has been in the tournament scene for a good while, making diligent and clean contributions to various tournaments, especially in regards to managing and hosting the Polish national ones. Granted, this is *not* a tournament mapset that we are featuring this month, but I think those contributions are still worth mentioning, as this map is their Loved premiere after all.

[Attack of the Killer Queen](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1614851#mania) is exactly what it says on the tin (well, in the mapset description). Coming from the *Deltarune* OST, clocking in at 144 BPM at 1.0x, the mapset provides two approaches: a "speedjack" and a "dense chordjack" one. It has everything to provide to a large range of skill levels, with rates starting at 0.95x for "Bosom", the speedjack version, and 0.85x for "Perish", the dense chordjack version. Tune yourself to your preference, and jam away!

[Eclipse-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8493070)'s approach of mapping in general is really clean, rationalized and structured, so we hope you appreciate this set as much as we do through putting a positive vote in the thread!

You know who [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707) is. There's no need to introduce, them, but it should be stated that a nomination from them is long overdue, and as such, we're introducing [Brainfog](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1438983#mania/3028407) as their 20th nomination.

I'll keep it short: this chart is satisfying. Very satisfying. There are two noticeable approaches within the song, with the main sections consisting of 1/6 bursts alongside some doubles where they feel the most important, and all sections outside said streams/bursts utilizing a more minijack-heavy approach, only using 1/4 notes.

While this chart is just outright fun, it also had a notable tournament use, as [MWC 4K 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4K) used it in the Round of 16 pool on 1.2x rate.

Perhaps the simplest way to put it into words is that this chart feels really, *really* responsive. You truly do feel like you're hitting the notes, as weird as it sounds. If you're looking for that level of quality in a chart, then please go give this your vote.

The tiebreaker is indeed the [Essence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1943786#mania/4021083) of all tournaments. It is quite a fitting name as there are many patterns present in this chart, making it such a well-made tiebreaker.

[Essence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1943786#mania/4021083) already gives you challenges in terms of LN release, which is pretty technical already to say the least. After that however, it starts to get a bit faster, and more abrasive LN + rice patterns are going to start coming your way. In general, the start is already such a difficult part to accurately hit, and while breaks do exist in some bits of the first half of the chart, you only get a few moments to breathe as it starts to hit you with another set of difficult rice/LN patterns. Through minijacks, inverse, streams, anchors, and much more, this chart will really start to tire you out as you try to push through it.

Thankfully, you are gifted with a pretty long break section where you can rest a little. Playing this in a tournament setting, though, would force you to make no mistakes, as these sections would be the lowest chance of your opponent accidentally committing an error. However, after roughly a minute of a break section, you are treated to another part where it starts to get faster once again, as the chart starts to ramp up with jumpstreams, a bit of jacks, and technical patterns. While some long note sections still exist, most of this section will really start to punish you with many abrasive rice patterns.

What's quite terrifying here is as time passes on, the BPM starts to increase by a bit, even though you are tired out from all the patterns in this chart. By the tail end of the chart, you are greeted with some handstreams, and then a hybrid section which can really make you drop a lot of accuracy. Hit the full LN section, and you'll definitely be able to survive. Luckily, there is a break section at the very end, where you can reflect on what really makes a good tiebreaker and enjoy the fruits of your labour.

I think this chart really encompasses the essence of what a good tiebreaker is, and I'd like to commend all the mappers/charters and everyone who was able to make this possible. With that being said, I think this totally deserves your vote to be in Loved, and I think it's about time that the Loved category has another taste of the [Essence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1943786#mania/4021083) of tiebreakers in tournaments.

It's been [7 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnygxZoyaQ) since *Flamingo* has been brought into the rhythm gaming scene. At first glance, a pretty innocent, cute and catchy song. This song however, developed sort of a cult following at the time, which fuelled the Clone Hero meme scene quite a bit. From a cursory search, it seems to have made it into TikTok in 2019 somehow. In any case, *Flamingo* is a song that has historically cemented itself as a cult classic, first across rhythm game enthusiasts, then into the mainstream.

It's no surprise that the virus has spread into other rhythm games. [Mipha-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5767941), also one of my fellow passive Clone Hero enjoyers, pulls a good amount of inspiration from that scene, at least in terms of vibe. I can't really say long note oriented charts existed in a substantial way in *Clone Hero* until [somewhat recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNxUwiR71dQ), but the vibe of the song lends itself to be drawn into tricky LN releases for sure.

Anything low BPM involving LNs requires increased amounts of coordination and control, and star rating aficionados may find themselves at a loss of understanding as to how hard it is to handle compared to maps with a higher note density. Even in the 2025 context, *Flamingo* features brain-scratching patterns and releases that demand utmost focus and mastery in order to manage full accuracy.

Many cool songs with compelling rhythms have entered our view during the World Cups. [Revolt](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2130612) would be one of the most memorable. Its mapping logic emphasizes symmetry and features columns varying in regular and clear ways. More importantly, these patterns are not mere showmanship — they fit the music itself perfectly. In terms of difficulty, this map examines the players' overall LN skill with numerous LN pattern types. When you're ready, try the challenge! And if you like it, make sure to cast your vote!

This month, we've got a nice, clean, hybrid spread mapset. [JuHaa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15526127) returns to the Loved section after a long absence with [Final Flash Flight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1715665#mania/3505719)!

This mapset has a full spread and the smooth, flowing hybrid notes and simple expressions that JuHaa is known for. The variety of patterns combined with the different moods of the song will keep you from getting bored. We think this map deserves to be Loved and enjoyed by everyone, from beginners to intermediate players.
