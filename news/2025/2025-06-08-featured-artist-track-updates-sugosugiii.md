[**sugosugiii**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/442) has been one of osu!'s Featured Artists [for the last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-10-20-new-featured-artist-sugosugiii). While some people might take a break after achieving their goals, **sugosugiii**'s music making momentum shows no signs of stopping.

Throughout the last few months, **sugosugiii** released a new album, another EP, a bunch of original songs produced in conjunction with tournaments, and even more singles. We're here to officially bring them into osu!.

**15** tracks have been added to [**sugosugiii**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/442), each paired with its own pre-timed beatmap template, allowing mappers to do their thing with one less task to worry about.

Check out [the listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/442) and pay extra attention towards anything with this fancy **NEW** label:
