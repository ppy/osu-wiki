Haven't heard this name for a while? Check out all the major changes to Beatmap Spotlights! This time, we are also seeking fresh blood to ensure the project can run smoothly for many seasons to come!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-04-09-beatmap-spotlights-revival-spring-2025/banner.jpg)

It's been some time since we last met here indeed... Let's examine what happened in the meantime, since there's certainly a lot to cover.

Even though the playlists are already up and running, we invite you to read on for the story about the new Beatmap Spotlights infrastructure, and the path that led us back to where we are today!

## A lengthy history lesson

Heading into 2024, right after the conclusion of the Autumn 2023 season, the Beatmap Spotlights project was put on hold due to osu!(lazer) scoring and infrastructure changes.

Some time passed, and alongside the introduction of [Daily Challenge](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-07-25-introducing-daily-challenges) in July 2024, discussions began about how that and Beatmap Spotlights would coexist in the future. After some deliberation, it was decided that both projects would focus on their distinct matters, and aim for a different player base.

With that, Beatmap Spotlights could run again. However, before that could happen, various parts of Spotlights infrastructure would need to see some change.

The idea was to create a new, unified system for curating beatmaps directly on the website, along with brand-new infrastructure to handle it, including live-updating rankings and seasonal divisions, extending on [previously implemented seasons backend](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/9725).

While the idea was simple, it wouldn't be easy. At this point, intense work was ahead for every person involved in the Beatmap Spotlights project. Since we are finally here, it means the goals set ahead of us were successfully achieved, and so we are excited to announce major changes influencing every single inch of the Beatmap Spotlights workflows.

Can't wait to hear what changed during the over-a-year-long pause? Be sure to read on below!

## New osu! website Beatmap Spotlights infrastructure

To kick things off, we'd like to introduce you to brand-new Beatmap Spotlights infrastructure implementations on the osu! website.

### Live seasonal score calculation & leaderboards

Seasonal scoring is now calculated every time you submit a score. Alongside that, the Spotlights season pages now include a full seasonal leaderboard with dynamically updating division tiers.

Want to see this in action? Submit a score in one of the playlists below and look up your name!

- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/seasons/42)
- [osu!taiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/seasons/43)
- [osu!catch](https://osu.ppy.sh/seasons/44)
- [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/seasons/45)

### User profile seasonal division display

Your division and seasonal rank placement won't be visible in the season listing only. As of now, we are introducing a seasonal statistics display on user profiles!

When hovered, detailed statistics will be displayed, including your seasonal score and rank.

## Project-level changes

The other branches of the project came to see some changes as well.

### Improved playlist system

Back in the [August 2023 season](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-10-23-beatmap-spotlights-season-10-autumn-2023), we announced the end of playlist gimmicks, which were being used in previous seasons.

While we don't foresee the gimmicks coming back due to various limitations, we still want the first playlist of each season to be more distinct.

From now on, **Playlist A of each Beatmap Spotlights season will contain only recent beatmaps**. This is to let players discover modern gems, and to return to an older mode of operation for the Beatmap Spotlights: highlighting and rewarding fresh mapping masterpieces.

### Changes to Beatmap of the Season

Extending on Playlist A reformulations, we'd like to introduce tweaks to the *Beatmap of the Season* awards.

We used to run a voting between players and Beatmap Spotlight Curators, asking both groups for their favourite Beatmap included in the season.

Starting today, we'd like to split the Beatmap of the Season in two:

1. The Beatmap of the Season will be selected by Beatmap Spotlight Curators and will be announced alongside a season's launch in Playlist A. This makes the Beatmap of the Season a highlight for the most outstanding recent map (according to the curators), serving as an award and *spotlight* for both the beatmap and its author.
2. The *players' favourite* voting will still be hosted at the end of each season, including all beatmaps selected for the season.

The creator of both highlighted maps will receive 3 months of osu!supporter.

The curators' pick for the current Beatmap of the Season can be found in the [playlist listing](#playlists).

## How do I participate in Beatmap Spotlights League? {id=how-to-participate}

To participate in Beatmap Spotlights, grab yourself the latest version of the [osu!(lazer) client](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/download).

Once you're done installing and logging into your account, head over to the `playlists` tab in the `play` section and find the Beatmap Spotlights lobbies, denoted by a little green `Spotlights` indicator. You can also toggle the filter to show only Beatmap Spotlight playlists in the top-right corner.

Changing game modes is as simple as clicking one of the four mode icons at the top left of your screen — and it'll be whatever game mode you played last on osu!(lazer) by default.

#### Beatmap of the Season

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-04-09-beatmap-spotlights-revival-spring-2025/4535239.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1836970#osu/4535239)

**[Lia - Tori no Uta (Luscent) \[Djulus' Insane\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1836970#osu/4535239)**, created by [Djulus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4960893)\
*primarily suggested and described by [KnightC0re](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7894340)*

Let a wave of nostalgia run through you, as Djulus' Insane on Luscent's mapset of the 2-decade-old song *Lia - Tori no Uta* has been chosen as the map of the season!

Featured as the opening theme in Studio Key's visual novel and later adapted anime *AIR* back in the 2000s, the song has gained substantial popularity within the anime community, so much so it's still being mapped to this day!

Of course, the map mirrors the nostalgic factor of the song as well, with the heavy usage of simple slider shapes, and the clean, consistent distance of individual patterns, both reflective of past mapping conventions and limitations. The map also takes advantage of the slow nature of the song to create an interesting experience, having some spaced flowy patterns that fit perfectly with its low BPM — really makes you feel like you're soaring through the skies like a bird.

Whether you're a seasoned anime enjoyer, a casual player looking for something simple, or an expert wanting to play some unique patterns with rate changes, this is a map you wouldn't wanna miss!

*primarily suggested and described by [Boaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13302996)*

This season, Cychloryn awakened from his 3-year mapping slumber to cook up some quality beatmaps for all osu!taiko players to enjoy! We have chosen the best one to showcase in the Spotlight playlist this season: *Burnt Rice (Aiobahn & Jh-Anu Remix)*.

Those who are not familiar with this map might think it's just going to be an ordinary 4\*, but Cychloryn definitely had some other ideas in mind. Combining high and low SV and intensity, *Burnt Rice (Aiobahn & Jh-Anu Remix)* is an immersive anti-mod map that keeps you on your toes at all times.

Are you ready to take on the flying notes on your screen? Make sure to check out *Burnt Rice (Aiobahn & Jh-Anu Remix)* in the newest osu!taiko Spotlight playlist!

Coming off the heels of one of the biggest [osu! original](/wiki/Community/Bespoke_music) productions osu!catch has ever seen, the map lives up to the spectacle.

Being tasked with mapping for such an event can really kick-start motivations to help inspire something beautiful. After [CWC 2024](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024) was all said and done, Deif went and made a platter that was JUST as high-quality as the original diff, with wide swing jump patterns that generated one of the greatest sets of the season.

**[Ludicin - Everlasting Eternity (Critical\_Star) \[\[7K\] Timeless\]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2099753#mania/4404687)**, created by [Critical\_Star](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3793196)\
*primarily suggested and described by [Maxus](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4335785)*

Behold: what you see here is a masterpiece. How often do you see a full marathon spread with storyboard and keysounds combined with an extremely complex and smoothly charted-out map, requiring unfathomable amounts of knowledge and experience to pull such results off?

Critical_Star has been well known in the entire osu!mania community for his expertise in mapping and ranking 7K charts countless times. However, this mapset is undoubtedly THE best grand set that he has produced throughout his mapping career.

Charting a Ludicin song is usually a complex task due to the tiebreaker-style songs with a lot of genres combined, especially in 7K. The chart offers many pattern variations that represent both the fast and slow pace of the music, with well-thought-out long note placements, hybrid combinations with tech aspects of rice and chordstreams that emphasize the music and contrast between every section. The beauty of the storyboard and keysound also complement that extremely well.

Without a doubt, this boss chart deserves its place as the top spotlight pick, and we are confident that it will bring you along for the best of experiences and most rewarding of rides!
