If you're going to discover one more musician this year, it better be **MIDInco**.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/515/header.jpg)

**MIDInco**, an alias of renowned artist *x髥莏* (*xKyozou*), is here to demonstrate a different side of their musical capacity. With tunes for iconic games like *DEEMO II* and *Cytus II* already under their belt, **MIDInco** has developed their own approach to symphonic dubstep, offering an authentic rhythm game sound to osu!'s Featured Artist library!

More specifically, **5** tracks are now on [**MIDInco**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/515), ready as blank `.osz` canvases for you to drop into the editor and begin mapping.

As much as we want to gush about **MIDInco**'s music, these songs can speak for themselves:

Just a heads up: [**MIDInco**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/515) has pre-timed beatmap templates for every song you previewed above. If you're looking for mapping advice for any of these songs, you can also ask in the `#mappers-guild` channel of the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy)!

The year is nearly over, but we still have a few more Featured Artists to go. If you're familiar with osu! traditions, you already know something special is on the way.

Stay tuned.
