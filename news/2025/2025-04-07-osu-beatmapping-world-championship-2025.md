## Format

**o!bwc** is a team-based beatmapping contest for the **osu! game mode**. It follows a round-based format, consisting of a ranking-based **[qualifier round](#qualifier-round)** and multiple single-elimination **[clash rounds](#clash-rounds)**.

At the beginning of each round, a new song will be announced for teams to showcase their mapping prowess on, and with it a pre-timed beatmap template to start with.

## Registration

**[Click here to register for this contest!](https://form-auth.ppy.sh/form/2025-bwc-registrations)**

Teams consist of 4–6 members and represent their country, meaning every member must share the same country flag.

The captain should join the contest's [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/QGzz3n655u) to keep up with updates and announcements. Others are free to do that too!

## Beatmapping and submission

The contributions of team members must be declared, for example, with a list of sections mapped by each individual mapper.

Each submission should comply with the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) when applicable and remain unsubmitted and anonymous until the results are announced. Do not modify metadata such as Artist, Title, and Tags in the provided template. While custom hitsounds and custom combo colours are allowed, backgrounds, videos, or storyboards are not allowed.

When submissions open, you'll be able to drop your exported `.osz` file to the designated submission site.

## Judging

There will be two panels of judges: one for the *qualifier round*, and the other for the *clash rounds*.

Submissions will be judged according to the following criteria:

### Qualifier round

- **Expertise (45%)** – How well the map reflects the music elements, with an emphasis on music reflection, pattern/rhythm consistency, coherence, and playability.
- **Creativity (45%)** – How the map stands out compared to current mapping trends and other submissions. Generic maps or copy-paste concepts are discouraged. Creativity built on top of solid expertise is more than important as well.
- **Judge's Impression (10%)** – Judges can award or deduct points based on specific noteworthy aspects as they deem appropriate, such as outstanding sections and hitsounds or vice versa.
- Judging scores will be standardised.

### Clash rounds

- Clash rounds are based on a voting system. Each round consists of head-to-head matchups between two teams.
- Each judge has one vote for each matchup and they must vote for one team out of the two. The team with the highest number of votes will pass this round and the other will be eliminated.

## Prizes and awards

- **Contest points:** [Contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) may be awarded after the contest has concluded (pending approval).
- **Badges:** Badges may be awarded after the contest has concluded (pending approval).
- **osu!supporter and cash prizes:** osu!supporter and cash prizes may be awarded to the top teams after the contest has concluded. Availability depends on the sponsorship secured.
