You're obviously an osu! player, but do your friends know? Do your neighbors know? Does every person you pass on the street know? If you wear a new osu! t-shirt (or an osu! hoodie), they will.

Okay, fine. People you pass on the street probably don't know what osu! is, but that shouldn't stop you from upgrading your wardrobe:

We've explored a variety of t-shirt designs throughout the years, but one question has always been on your minds: "Why don't any osu! t-shirts feature *osu!* itself?"

That's why [the *multi-mode* t-shirt](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1582) exists, sporting a simple osu! logo on the front side...

...While the back side has a snippet of gameplay from every ruleset! According to its designer [Sing](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3795679), each of these object arrangements comes from a World Cup Grand Finals tiebreaker. Good luck figuring out which ones.

Oh, and did we mention this is available as [a zip-up hoodie](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1575) too?

The next osu!(lazer) update is going to be a big one, and that's clearly because [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) has been developing the game while wearing this.

Get your preferred garment from either of these store pages:

- [*multi-mode* t-shirt](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1582)
- [*multi-mode* hoodie](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1575)

Perhaps the osu!clock evangelists were right. We needed hitcircles on our merchandise all along.

## [the three digit number t-shirt](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1545)

Look at what you've done to our developer.

On the front side of [*the three digit number* t-shirt](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1545), you'll see... it. The text on top very appropriately reads "three numbers which will haunt you forevermore".

Carved into the backside is a sigil inspired by the one who first bore witness. Wear this wisely, as anyone who doesn't share your curse will surely have questions.

In case you were wondering who to make a voodoo doll out of, [kaetwo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1997719) is the mastermind behind this design.

## seasonal pippi t-shirts

Anyone familiar with osu!'s seasonal fanart contests has surely come across [Tofumang](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223)'s illustrative perfection. We think he's pretty good at drawing too, so we asked him to place osu!'s mascot [pippi](/wiki/Mascots#pippi) in the hottest and coldest seasons.

Then, of course, he delivered beyond expectations.

In both bright yellow and sunset orange, [the *pippi under the sun* t-shirt](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1551) captures a snapshot of pippi under the blazing sun.

You might think of peppy as a stone-cold software developer, but when he's wearing this t-shirt, he's a totally different person.

In shades of purple and green, [the *pippi under the stars* t-shirt](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1563) presents pippi under a chilly night sky, wrapped in enough layers to keep anyone warm and comfy.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-10-03-osu-t-shirts-and-a-hoodie/winter_body.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1563)

We'll refrain from a pun about how "cool" peppy looks here.

## Other products

"What's going to happen to older osu! t-shirts?", you might ask. We've set up [the *last chance items* store page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/723) covering *all* of our soon-to-be-extinct t-shirts (and Taikonator 3000 plushies). There aren't many left, but if you want one in addition to your fancy new clothes, now's the time.

We also re-stocked [pink and brown *isshoni pippi* t-shirts](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/560), so they'll be sticking around for a while longer!

And in completely unrelated news, [**osu!tablets are back in stock too!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1447) We're shipping these from Hong Kong, so due to trade restrictions, we are not currently shipping to the US. For everyone else, shipping fees should be much lower!
