Circles and sliders have infinite potential. It's your task to convert that potential into a map that's actually good (and earn some fancy prizes along the way).

The [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is exactly as you'd expect: a contest that runs every month.

We're going back to the basics for this month's contest. Sorry drum bashers/fruit catchers/key smashers, this contest is for **osu!** only:

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Every iteration of the Monthly Beatmapping Contest adds an extra rule to keep things fresh.

This time around, you can choose **one** of these options:

- **All combos in your map must end in an *odd* number**
- **All combos in your map must end in an *even* number**

If you choose the first, your combos must be a length of **1, 3, 5, 7, etc.**, while if you choose the second option, your combos must be a length of **2, 4, 6, 8, etc.**

Decide your song and combo requirement wisely! The more creativity you show through your choice, the better you'll perform in the judging phase.

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!
