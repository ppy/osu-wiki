Bow before **1zm8**, the latest addition to our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/474/header.jpg)

Branching out from remixes to original work in 2023, electronic music producer **1zm8** has been designing his own unique sound inspired by extensive rhythm game experience and music game masterminds like *Laur*, *Team Grimoire*, [*t+pazolite*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/396), [*Morimori Atsushi*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/108), [*3R2*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/187), [*BlackY*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/150), and [*Yooh*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/218)!

Here on osu!, **9** tracks are part of [**1zm8**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/474), prepared with pre-timed `.osz` files. If you don't know what those are for yet, plop one in the editor to find out.

**1zm8**'s music isn't something we can solely talk about though. Listen and experience it for yourself:

More songs can be found on [**1zm8**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/474). If you don't believe us, that's a weird stance to take considering the evidence is a click away. You do you, though.

Keen observers might know what happens next weekend. For those out of the loop though, chances are high for a new Featured Artist announcement. Stay tuned to find out.
