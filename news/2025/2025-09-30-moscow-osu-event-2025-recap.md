This year’s Moscow osu! Event took place at Mosproducer, a concert hall situated in the center of Moscow, the capital of Russia.


# Activities recap
### Cosplay défilé
A cosplay défilé was organised during the event, allowing anyone to show themselves as their favourite (or funny) character.
All participants' cosplays were also judged by event organisers, choosing these works as the best ones:

1st place - ::{ flag=RU }:: **myfk** cosplaying Rin Kaenbyou from Touhou Project. Her ribbon show during défilé shocked everyone, immediately proving that she deserves that first place.

2nd place - ::{ flag=RU }:: **[ksuenoot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5069845)**, a winner of last year cosplay défilé, with a cosplay of Burnice from Zenless Zone Zero. She became the only person getting to top 3 cosplays for 2 consecutive years.

### Gaming booth
A dedicated gaming booth was set up for all osu! players where they could play a VR game Beat Saber, Taiko no Tatsujin, and, well... osu!
There also were some merchandise booths with different stickers, t-shirts, keyboards, and more.

### Match highlights

### ::{ flag=RU }:: [BJIADOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17031854) vs. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785) 

**Match log: [MOE2025: (BJIADOC) vs (Lexu2S)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118776739)**\
**Match VOD: [MOE2025 Day 1 — 47:11](https://youtu.be/dR9aCY2Bq4w?si=VWFEB4ohQAst7xqj&t=2870)**


The first match of the tournament, unlike most of viewers expectations, became the first (and only) match that went up to Tiebreaker!
::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785) was very good with his speed picks, as well as the flow stream one. ::{ flag=RU }:: [BJIADOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17031854), on the other hand, showed himself well on the snap alt and hidden mod picks, with HD3 being the only close map (14,627 points difference!) up until the tiebreaker. The tiebreaker itself was even closer though, but with a total difference of 13,725 points, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785) managed to win and advance to the next stage!

### ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) vs ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867)

**Match log: [MOE2025: (Lexu4S) vs (Lexu3S)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/118799095)**\
**Match VOD: [MOE2025 Day 3 — 9:48:57](https://youtu.be/fIpS-LFpB7w?si=qcziZXmLM-eatEO2&t=35337)**

The final match of the tournament. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867), being the runner-up for the last 2 iterations of MOE, now gets a third chance to win the tournament. And even though ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) was not getting this far before and actually losing to ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) last year, he still has high chances to win this tournament as well.

The first half of the match went pretty straightforward: both players were easily taking their picks up until the score of 3-3. After that, something went wrong and 3 breakpoints have happened in a row, getting the score to 4-5. The last map was picked by ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) and won by him as well!

With a score of 6-4, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) have won Moscow osu! Event for the first time, breaking his 2nd place curse. His performance during the whole tournament was very astonishing, making him one of the best Russian players with a no doubt!
