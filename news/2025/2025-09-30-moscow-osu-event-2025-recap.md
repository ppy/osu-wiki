This year's Moscow osu! Event took place in Mosproducer, a concert hall located in a centre of Russia's capital, Moscow.


# Activities recap
### Cosplay défilé
A cosplay défilé was organised during the event, allowing anyone to show themselves as their favourite (or funny) character.
All participants' cosplays were also judged by event organisers, choosing these works as the best ones:

1st place - ::{ flag=RU }:: **myfk** cosplaying Rin Kaenbyou from Touhou Project. Her ribbon show during défilé shocked everyone, immediately proving that she deserves that first place

2nd place - ::{ flag=RU }:: **[ksuenoot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5069845)**, a winner of last year cosplay défilé, with a cosplay of Burnice from Zenless Zone Zero. She became the only person getting to top 3 cosplays for 2 consecutive years

# The Main Tournament

Now we get to the most interesting part. The Main Tournament contained 16 players, with 8 of them ( ::{ flag=RU }:: [DaHuJka](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6830745), ::{ flag=RU }:: [gamer228666](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5981005), ::{ flag=RU }:: [KOCT9H](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6585939), ::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785), ::{ flag=RU }:: [-Din-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7972980), ::{ flag=RU }:: [maxim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9459674), ::{ flag=RU }:: [reimia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11243772) & ::{ flag=RU }:: [xayoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13334336)) getting there through the [CIS Tournament Rating](link.rtvs.fun/moe2025ratings),  
1 (::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263)) for their results on #russian osu! cup 2024, 1 (::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867)) for their results on #russian osu! cup klassic '25, 4 (::{ flag=RU }:: [11iq pleer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13206785), ::{ flag=RU }:: [BJIADOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17031854), ::{ flag=RU }:: [fedotoff](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7351448) & ::{ flag=RU }:: [GodRoPoNiKa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11195861)) from the Closed Qualifier, and 2 (::{ flag=KZ }:: [nejzha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8105138) & ::{ flag=BY }:: [Vudek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8816345)) as Wildcard Invites!

### Match highlights:

### ::{ flag=RU }:: [BJIADOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17031854) vs. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785)

**[You can view the match VOD here!](https://youtu.be/dR9aCY2Bq4w?si=VWFEB4ohQAst7xqj&t=2870)**


The first match of the tournament, unlike most of viewers expectations, became the first (and only) match that went up to Tiebreaker!
::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785) was very good on his speed picks, as well as the flow stream one. ::{ flag=RU }:: [BJIADOC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17031854), on other side, showed himself well on the snap alt and hidden mod picks, with HD3 being the only close map (14,627 points difference!) up until tiebreaker. The tiebreaker itself was even closer though! With a total difference of 13725 points, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Lexu2S](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8251785) have managed to win this match and advance to the next stage!

### ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) vs ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867)

The final match of the tournament. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867), being the runner-up for the last 2 iterations of MOE, now gets a third chance to win the tournament. And even though ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) was not getting this far before and actually losing to ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) last year, he still has high chances to win this tournament as well.

The match begins with ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) picking HD2, a low AR aim map, and wins it easily! Right after that ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) picks DT3, a high density speed wins, and manages to get a full combo on it! This beginning already shows us this match would not be easy for both of them

After that start, the match went kinda predictable for the next 4 maps. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) was getting well on the tech and snap alt maps, while ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) showed his abomination on the speed maps.

But, on the score of 3-3, something unexpected have happened. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) have decided to pick HR3, a snap aim map where both of the players have showed an incredible scores during previous matches. Watching them play this map against each other was... something. Both of their scores was VERY CLOSE during the whole map. In fact, in about 10 seconds before the map's end, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) had a 500 points lead! But unfortunately for him, he got notelocked on the last pattern, and lost the map with a difference of 8,477 points! This is the first breakpoint for the match. This could've already been an end for ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263), since ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) have not lost his picks before. Unless..

After that breakpoint, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) decides to pick NM1, a 224 BPM aim map. And on the early beginning of the map, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) already managed to get a few misses, allowing ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) to get enough a 60000 difference for the first half of the map. But, on that half, both of them have got a miss, meaning that the score difference would not really change for some time. On the second half, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) was holding well with more than 500 combo at some moment, while ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) still could not keep up with not missing. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) have won that map with more than 100 thousand score difference, making it the second breakpoint in a row.

For the next pick, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) have chosen DT4, a high AR map with bunch of flow aim. Unfortunately for ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263), he was not able to keep good accuracy on that map, which can't be said about ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867). And even though ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) had managed to keep combo a bit better than ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867), the accuracy difference was too big. With a difference of 35870 points and 3,24% of accuracy, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) won DT4, making it the third breakpoint in a row and also getting to the match point!

The next ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867)'s pick was HR1, and, unlike the previous three maps, this one went kinda predictable. ::{ flag=RU }:: [Skrowell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9694263) was not able to keep up with ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867), losing that map with a big difference.

With a score of 6-4, ::{ flag=RU }:: [Welter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11552867) have won Moscow osu! Event for the first time, breaking his 2nd place curse. His performance during the whole tournament was very astonishing, making him one of the best Russian players with a no doubt!
