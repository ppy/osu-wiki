It's here. [ProfessionalBox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3250792) has christened this 10 minute masterpiece mapset as his swan song, and what a legacy it leaves behind. Magnificent hitsounding and a beautiful storyboard by [PoNo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4610047) and [-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366), some fresh patterning and slider design all on top of a highly emotive collection of instrumental tracks, Alexithymia | Lupinus | Tokei no Heya to Seishin Sekai is one of the most impressive projects we've seen in a long time, or will see in the coming years. It behooves any osu! enthusiast to grace their clients with this paragon of beatmapping.

[Beomsan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3626063) and [Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602) here to show how detailed a map could be. In their mapset of Nekomata Master+'s "POINT ZERO", every pitch change and variation in intensity is perfectly represented, with the constant changes in spacing and the high contrast between slider velocities. But that's just the beginning.

To accompany the spontaneous piano and the jumbled background percussions near the end, the map strives to portray every bit of the music. Irregular patterns kick in, increasing the intensity of the beatmap to match the music. Such a chaotic piece being depicted in such a chaotic fashion, it's without question that this should be added to your collection.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/arrogance.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/940377)

Do you need to map literally everything when you want to follow a song in the best way? [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009) and [PandaHero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1233255) proved, in their new mapset onumi - ARROGANCE, that you don't need to at all. Pairing with their representative style which uses iconic slider shapes and various dope overlap patterns inserting strict geometrics, this mapset brings out onumi's experimental electronic song's hidden potential by largely and intentionally undermapping at certain key spots, especially at the beginning, the transition parts in the middle and at the end.

The duo follows the general vibe of the background instrumental ignoring the drums, sometimes even dropping entire sections, which forces players to notice every single layer's detail and thus represent the whole song much more clearly, instead of blindly trying to follow every single sound in this very complex track. In addition, carefully chosen hitsounds aid in improving the overall playing experience overall.

If you are getting bored by maps that placing objects on every single sound, this is bound to surprise you, without doubt.

[Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009) has seen a fair amount of airtime in the osu! spotlights, and Sit down. Stand up. (Snakes & Ladders.) earns him his second nominated mapset this season. Though some may criticize the map as "boring" for the most part, Mirash manages to do an excellent job of creating an atmosphere unlike much of what's been seen before. The map is a gradual crescendo culminating in a fiery, chaotic payoff that mirrors the song's central themes of oppression, control, and uprising.

The beauty in Sit down. Stand up. (Snakes & Ladders.) stems from the story it tells, from beginning to end.

Being a fanatic of Nekomata Master's music tracks, [Icekalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5410645) decided to compile some of their best in Instrumental Compilation. He portrays every track excerpt as thoroughly as possible, putting in 1/6 trills, long chains of low bpm streams, varying slider velocity choices constantly, all in an effort to keep the map as engaging as possible.

On top of this, he also invited mappers [ScubDomino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308), [den0saur](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5385151), [Xilver15](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3099689) and [celerih](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4696296) to map a few of the songs as well, with each of their own unique styles to represent their respective songs.

Stop arguing over whether flawless playability and high-end aesthetic can exist in the same map: [captin1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/689997) and [Kalibe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3376777) have proven in their collaboration work, lmy - Last words, that it is completely possible. Multiple takes on emphasis combining with positively weird but well-designed slider patterns bring a whole new playing experience set to Aitsuki Nakuru's beautiful voice.

What would you expect in a map for a piano song from literally two decades ago? [Gust](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1244312) showed in their mapset, Maeda Jun - Natsukage, that even in a calm song we can still do something rememberable.

The top diff uses numerous equal-distance obtuse angle patterns, which have a delicately increasing playing difficulty when you finishing them. By doing that, this difficulty can accurately represent all those little crescendos in the piano melodies. Besides, the top difficulty also uses "different time spacing" gimmicks under low ar(8), so it can maximize the representation of the song's atmosphere in all of its different parts.

Of course, the additional key hitsounds also do a great work on adding another flavor to the whole map, too. If you are expecting something chill and simple, or want to sit down and find a silent space to put your whole heart in, then you're bound to feel right at home in this set.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/shadow.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/914754)

A wild [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) has appeared on the Spotlights!

Shadowmaker, made by pishifat, can be described in one sentence: it shows how various and diverse a map can be. Each notable section is represented very well and all of them have their own strong characteristics and specific gimmicks. For example, when the section where the guitar gets really intense and builds towards a climax, the map follows suit, loaning to a spectacularly refined representation of the song overall.

Not only are there efforts to showcase individual styles, but it also caters to a specific, stronger style overall that help binds the map together as a cohesive whole. For example, the map shines with a consistent structure throughout each section, embracing both the homogeneous and the creative in a combination which is a standout among recent mapping styles.

Another interesting aspect of the map that it is impossible not to mention is the Slider Velocity changes. pishifat has spent a huge amount of effort painstakingly testing the perfect SV changes to highlight the song best—a simple glance in the editor will show you the extent of his labors. The build-up part before the alternator style section in particular sports some incredible changes, dropping from a 4.00x speed down to 1.50x. All this and much more combine to showcase some incredible attention paid to mapping out individual sounds, such as the guitar and snare, and come together to create an amazing experience that has absolutely no chance of not amazing you.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/alde.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/607948)

Have you ever wanted something to brighten up your day? You're in luck! I proudly present to you sakyzyo - Aldebaran mapped by [Ellyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4438154) as a prime candidate.

The map mostly keeps a visually polished and balanced structure, featuring a lot of blankets and making excellent use of slider aesthetics to remain pleasant to look at. Spaced 1/4 sections rather than the more regular stacked ones pose an interesting contrast, and beside these, the mapper puts some serious effort into visual gimmicks featuring sliders, mainly during the kiai section where the rapid 1/8 roll sounds are mirrored in the shape of the sliders covering them. The variance and attention to detail really makes them shine.

The map is visually spectacular, but it doesn't just stop there! Hitsounding. During the kiai, the mapper draws on hitsounding techniques reminiscent of [Skystar's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961) [dreamless wanderer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/286414#osu/646609), expressing every "wub" with considerable complexity and variance. Given the general difficulty of hitsounding overall, this is nothing to scoff at! In addition, the no-kiai sections are also keysounded with incredible care and attention, showcasing an attention to detail that goes truly above and beyond.

I would also like to mention [\_MiaoFUuU\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4299356)'s Insane difficulty too, as it is also great. Despite having a lower star rating, the map tries its best to express every sound it can, flying directly in the face of the common belief that lower difficulties have to eventually ignore some of them.

Overall the map is great, if the amount of stuff I've written about it isn't already any indication. Try it out! You're sure to be amazed.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/cross.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/922249)

[Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602) is back to the ranked section with On Cross Over, by HyuN feat. LyuU, featuring a guest difficulty from [Dailycare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1634445).

Down puts a lot of interesting and cool visual touches on his top difficulty. For example, the intensity of the vocals is mirrored in slider velocity changes, yet kept visually consistent in a very aesthetically pleasing display. The difficulty overall features very strong slider velocity control, such as when a repeating 1/3 circle + slider pattern appears, the mapper slows the velocity right down to accentuate fading out sounds extra efficiently.

When the song becomes complex with calm, and intense sections interacting, the mapper uses technically impressive alternating SV control in order to express some of the instrument sounds over others, producing a result that is really fun to play.

The map embraces a lot of gimmicks overall in a very unique style that interesting, and absolutely notable. Make sure to check out Dailycare's guest difficulty as well—it's also awesome!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/kan.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1001507)

[Nathan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4785223) is no stranger to making banger maps to banger songs. As expected, his map of Kan Saete Kuyashiiwa by ZUTOMAYO does not disappoint in that regard.

Always fast paced on 150 BPM, the map capitalizes on the song's energy with sometimes quirky, sometimes unforgiving, and sometimes outright beautiful patterns. This map promises from start to finish to give you an osu! experience like no other—only of course, if you can pass it.

If you are having trouble with Nathan's geragera difficulty, don't you worry because his Insane along with Luscent's Extra and ScubDomino's Hard have you covered. In this set you are guaranteed to find a worthwhile experience, so check it out!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/kokoro.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1020878)

[toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) brings a very nice map with a nostalgic and god-tier song called Kokoro Odoru by nobodyknows+ to the ranked section!

The top difficulty mostly keeps very structured, yet embraces unusual patterning and mapping concepts, mostly in non-stacked yet closely spaced elements which give a new gameplay experience. There are visually very similar patterns that share the same structure yet evolve with previous patterning, loaning a sort of gradual consistency throughout the map which really showcase its strong character and concept.

[bbj0920](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87546)'s Expert difficulty is also a beatmap that definitely deserves a piece of the cake. It features very varied and diverse spacing controls that follow the song's overall mood in the progress of time. It uses a lot of interesting rhythms, for example, there are some which mix things up by featuring sliderends on the white tick, which is something quite unusual and not frequently used these days, yet plays great all the same. With all of these and some of the other gimmicks that the map consists of, it perfectly manages to follow the song properly and catches almost ever sound that the song provides.

Try this set out! No difficulty on it will disappoint you and all of them are sure to make you dance, as the top difficulty's name does!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/taiko/fire.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/978134)

Taking the first place in the Autumn Spotlights is Dustvoxx, Laur - FireLight, a tribecore track that will absolutely not surprise those familiar with previous works from [yea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6874332). Boasting a marathon length of 5 minutes and 39 seconds, the map does not become boring at any given second, as the steady pacing of the song mixed with its classic buildups and choruses will certainly keep you on your toes.

It would be highly inappropriate to not mention how the slider velocity manipulation has accompanied the patterning, providing a perfect topping to an already delicious cake. The small changes in the music intensity have been perfectly recreated with their respective slider velocity changes. Finally, it is of utmost importance to give credit to the wavy slider velocity section in the tribal-esque music section, which not only is a sight to behold, but also a reading challenge for an otherwise simple melodic section.

All in all, yea has managed to give birth to a worthy successor to the other Spotlight victor "Sound Chimera" and to a thrilling masterpiece deserving of its top spot in the Autumn Spotlights.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/taiko/manycolors.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/984900)

In 2nd place we have Frums - theyaremanycolors mapped by [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091), a song and map created by two very popular individuals in their respective communities. This is a very intricate and a harder-than-average GD set where each mapper shows off their own understanding of the song.

Each difficulty contains excellent usage of slider velocity changes to give the player more depth in relation to both the map and music. Each difficulty is beautifully crafted and shows deep understanding of what proper structure in a map should be. Something this set does which not many people have done this year is make their lower difficulties enjoyable, and it's clear that all the mappers involved in this mapset have spent a lot of time and care making sure every difficulty is to the highest of standards. Breaks in every difficulty are utilised well and are executed in a way which leaves no room for boredom throughout the entire map.

The top difficulty, Synthesia, has players having to hit many different snappings and wields Genjuro's favorite weapon of choice, slider velocity, which gives the player an immersive experience and allows them to become indulged in the music as they play this masterpiece of a map.

In the third place, we have Good-bye Chalon, an instrumental track by Nekomata Master where [\_DUSK\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6092181) perfectly managed to capture the rustic feeling of the music.

As the song itself is fairly complex, the Inner Oni difficulty features a lot of patterns on irregular snaps while maintaining impeccable flow, which results in a very satisfying gameplay experience as it provides players with a nice accuracy challenge while flawlessly following the music. Apart from the patterns themselves, the SV usage does a very good job at representing the intensity of each section which makes this a great map in terms of visual responsiveness.

The Oni difficulty gives intermediate players a chance to shine as it is structured in a way that it doesn't become too complex for the target audience while still being extremely fun to play!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/taiko/betrayal.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1026679)

The obligatory metal beatmap for the Autumn spotlights is Inferi - A Betrayal Unforetold, a Featured Artist song mapped by [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480) and [Grünschale/Greenshell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Greenshell) (with a storyboard by [Faputa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Faputa)!).

This intense song is filled with insane guitars and drums, which reflect in the Perfidiae difficulty. It's out to drain all of your stamina with its numerous never-ending 'deathstreams', complicated long streams that in this map also often include a staple for modern metal maps, mono streams. You will understand when you play the map, trust me. These streams are very well mapped, with the two mappers' styles not conflicting once in the map, rather complimenting each other, with several ideas shared between their sections making this map also feel more coherent.

Along with some inoffensive slider velocity changes the mappers managed to make a really good map to a quite difficult-to-map song, a feat that deserves a spot in this season's spotlights.

In 5th place we have Silentroom x Tanchiky - Outer Solution, which is an approach to MEGALOVANIA from the UNDERTALE series, one of the most popular games this year.

About the mapping, there's just so much to say about it that we could keep talking about it for hours: Even though [rubies87](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4949934) is a rather new mapper with this being his first apparition in the ranked section, it truly shines as one of the best creations that not even the most experienced mappers can possibly do.

With an incredible judgment of the tools the song provided him to make an excellent approach that could at first look incoherent to the song but ends up adding a layer to it that makes it much more rich and an adequate usage of SV that is perfectly readable on a first try, makes this map not only spotlight worthy but also a good reason to believe how promising rubies87 is as a mapper.

Closing this season's (and year's) spotlights we have Camellia - We Could Get More Machinegun Psystyle! (And More Genre Switches) mapped by [Alchyr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4993032), a popular individual who has created by far one of the most unique speed maps of the year.

Both the song and map are insane, showcasing a wide variety of snappings and BPM changes, making this quite the challenge to get good accuracy on, not to mention the fact that the player must also keep up with the speed of all the notes at the same time.

Slider velocity is seamlessly integrated into the map, especially in the variable BPM sections to compliment the frequent intensity changes of the music which gives an incredible amount of depth to the map. The map contains a hefty share of technical and stream sections which leaves no room for the player to rest for the entirety of it. If there's one person who knows how to map a speedy Camellia song properly, it's this guy.

Many mappers may assume that it's hard to be creative on calm and slow songs, but [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811) proves that slow maps can also be mapped with creativity. Though it's -Ken's first ranked map, the map itself is really clean and full of amazing patterns.

Especially for the kiai parts, the mapper uses a lot of high velocity sliders, which is not common in slow maps, but these sliders fit the map pretty well and give the player a pretty deep impact on this unique mapping style. The flows are carefully arranged and good for all players. Even with the hyper sliders, it's not hard for new players to catch. Spare some time and casually enjoy this masterpiece!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/catch/trappola.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/994994)

[Du5t](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6053071) just snatched the second place in this season's osu!catch Spotlights with his take on gmnt's "trappola bewitching"!

The top difficulty, named Necromancy, features intense jumps during the kiai sections, wild build-ups but calm intro and mid sections. Do not be fooled by the easy start, this map becomes challenging as soon as the melody picks up. The rhythm is easy to follow simply because Du5t decided to not vary the notes but instead do that with the patterns meanwhile trying to keep the distances as similar as possible, this was a very good decision. Due to this, it provides and easy ground to those who are skilled enough to earn an easy full combo by simply banging their head. This difficulty is a great example of how to make something good by holding back the Hyperdashes and just follow what is there.

But do not forget the guest mappers either, [Daletto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7592136), [Greaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2369776), [Nuvolina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974170) and [Sanyi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7496029) also contributed into this set, Each of these guys approached the Gothic Hardtrapcore genre differently so be sure to take a look at their part too. Who knows, you might fall in love with this set just as much as I did!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/catch/hype.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1009824)

Team osu!catch is here to take a place in this season's Spotlights with not one, nor two, but thirteen mappers!

Dreamland, which is the top difficulty, is mapped by [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) in collab. Everyone is surely already familiar with them and probably know that they are here for a rare treat. Without even looking at who mapped which part it is easy to recognize their styles even when they are blending into each other in a godly manner. From the calm mid-section through the build-ups and intense intro to the kiais, this map is perfectly orchestrated and delivers what you expect from both of the mappers.

Next up we have [Minato Yukina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253), [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) and a collab between [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114). They each offer a different approach on the same difficulty level which is on par, if not better, with the top difficulty. Minato Yukina decided to follow the melody which resulted in a streamy map with intense hyperjump sections, Rocma stands in the middle in terms of rhythm but he has wild patterns. Lastly, do not be fooled with the lower star rating for the collab, this is a real beast on its own, be prepared.

Going further down the list comes [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508), [Benita](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4023183) and yet another collab but now between [Sorcerer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1913190) and [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284). These guys took on the challenge and tried to approach the Rain difficulty differently, from low circle size to mostly 1/4 patterns. Do not be afraid if you can't handle one of these, try the others as well!

But let's not forget the rest of the team either—we still have a lot to speak of! The mapset features two Platter difficulty by [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768) and a collab between [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Mbomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3071175) each with their own mapping style fitting this difficulty. Then we have [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and [Sanyi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7496029) with a Salad and Cup respectively. These guys really went all out and made this mapset fitting for everyone.

Even still, we have two more names to mention who took part, namely [-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366), who created a wonderful storyboard and that is accompanied by hitsounding by [-Luminate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4778689). Together, they've created something really awesome. Congratulations guys!

Kill the beat by [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508) is another exciting electric song that hit the ranked category. The map consistently requires quick movements. In addition, the long sliders during the kiai of each difficulty require accurate rhythmic jumps, letting players truly catch (to) the beat. If you do like electronic music and are up for a challenge, do give this a try.

It is quite refreshing to have a K-pop in the ranked category. [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134)'s ranked map features an upbeat Korean song. The map is filled with interesting patterns across multiple difficulties that feel rewarding to play because of appropriately distanced jumps and little bits of antiflow that spices the map up, setting it apart from many others that may feel too standardized. Do please try this mapset, you won't regret it!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/catch/conflict.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/981762)

[Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284) jumps into this season's Spotlights with his mapset on siromaru + cranky's "conflict". This set has no kiai but that doesn't make it easier does it? If anything, it makes more interesting!

The Overdose features 1/4 jumps in quick succession as well as pattern repetition which does add to the difficulty. If you are looking for something which does not joke around the patterns and keeps them as consistent as possible, look no further, you just found it. Alongside this, we have high slider velocity which makes some patterns very interesting and provides yet another nice challenge.

For those who like a faster challenge, there is yet another Overdose called "Conquest of the Damned". Do not be fooled with the lower star rating—this can provide the same, if not more, challenge then the other difficulty. Last of all, we have the remaining lower difficulties: Rain with its much calmer approach of patterns even though it does feature the same 1/4 rhythm, Platter with its lowered rhythm and even easier patterns still, and then we have Salad and Cup for those who just want to enjoy some dope cranky fruit catching.

Be sure to tune in even if this is not your preferred game mode, this is a real treat!

After two long years, calling has finally been ranked! [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) has been pushing it back by making it better and better, but it is here at last, and has scored a spot on the Spotlights for his efforts. Despite the amazing aesthetic flows and streams, this map also has the epic hitsounds like other maps by the mapper himself. While enjoying the top difficulty, you may also try out other difficulties since the whole set is well done.

[Crowley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6341006) is definitely an underrated catch mapper. He tends to favor mapping Western songs a lot with each map featuring its own unique feeling, and Getaway is absolutely more of the same. With CS5 and AR8.4, the map feels pretty casual and comfortable, but much different from others. As one of the maps in osu!catch Carpool Tunnel Mini-pack, it is a good featured artist map for middle and top players. Take care of your accuracy as this map has many droplets throughout sliders.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/mania/xyz.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/682615)

Though we haven't seen their face in the ranked section for quite some time now, [Parachor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5241655) makes a strong, welcoming return back with XYZ which is arguably his most eloquent set to date along with [PotassiumF](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4247722). Featuring a track that is absolutely wonderful to listen to, you'll find that the two have masterfully executed an accompanying mapset, embracing concepts like pitch relevancy, LN orientation and ample SV use, all keyed in to match with the song.

If you've been in the mania community long enough, you might be aware of how Parachor loves to experiment with many of his maps with different uses of SVs, adding this incredible distinction from other mappers in the ranked section as he very well knows how to execute them astonishingly well to whatever song he finds to work well with them. This map isn't an exception to this as he perfectly knows the importance of timing and the beautiful things you can make with them, truly showcasing their importance as a mapping technique. Although it is on the lower side in terms of star rating, don't let PotassiumF's normal difficulty deceive you as it's not your ordinary normal difficulty—featuring tricky LN pattering and SVs as well, making his first introductory guest difficulty to the ranked section all in all a blast to play.

The set is gorgeous, well-thought out, and tricky to play as well, even for some of the top players of mania too. If you're looking for a challenge than your regular, average mania map, this map might just do it for you.

[BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043) jumps straight into the ranked section with this fantastic set, Bug Thief, alongside a guest difficulty by [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811). Both of them showcase their individual, unique approaches in the top two difficulties, both praised for their articulate layering and patterning abilities demonstrated in this set.

This set leads us to anticipate what both of these mappers may bring to the table in the future, especially from BringoBrango, who had gone somewhat unnoticed in the unranked section before this set was ranked. This map for certain deserves its spot in the spotlights, and we hope to see more from BringoBrango and Toaph Daddy in the future!

Combining gorgeous aesthetics and a solid overall structure, [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)'s crystallized is a treat for any long note enthusiast. The map juxtaposes lighter layered sections focused on strict layering for maximum emphasis alongside denser long note sections focused on following the more intense section's stronger synths and percussion while keeping representation understandable and consistent overall.

Despite the contrast between sections, -mint- does an impressive job at keeping coherent concepts consistent through the entire map, such as chord allocation and pitch relevancy. Her emphasis on using long note lengths to represent instrument type and intensity as well as her ability to differentiate regular and long notes depending on the instruments used and the intensity of the song is very impressive and shows her prowess in making long note maps. Overall the map is an absolute joy to play and the fantastic concepts used make it more than worthy of a place in Spotlights!

[Kamuy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7439226) successfully managed to capture the harsh and repetitive nature of PSYQUI's Education and has transformed it into a tough map that is not for the faint of heart! The chart cleverly exploits minijacks and short LNs to artificially induce the feeling of roughness and make the map harder to nail off, especially for players with ailing endurance.

Kamuy's implementation of the map's repetition also does justice to the song without actually making the map feel repetitive, using variations of structuring throughout the entire map. In general, the map is a blast to play to and as a medium to enjoy the song. If you are not up for the challenge though, [ByeForNow](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71991590)'s difficulty and all of the easier difficulties still follow the same ideologies while sparing you a fight.

A metronome will not help you at all.

After four years ([Jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972)'s old mapset of the song was submitted in August 2015), Konran Shoujo Soflan-chan makes it into the ranked section. With frequent BPM changes, the map keeps the player on their toes at all times. Though denpa is not for everyone, the map's unique patterning and concepts, especially with its LN usage and polyrhythms, makes for a wild and fun ride. Enjoyable overall, whether it be because of or in spite of its chaotic nature, this map deserves its place in this season's Spotlights.

Who would've thought we'd ever see this map ranked? [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), along with a 4K guest difficulty from [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), present an excruciatingly difficult mapset: Frums's Pictured as Perfect and Plus. The map simply packs in everything into a 5:44 masterpiece.

Blocko's 7K difficulty is replete with relentless patterning that coordinates the chaotic nature of the song to its fullest. The marathon hardly provides any breaks, so the HP Drain suddenly adds to the already chaotic nature of the map, not to mention the little touches of SV throughout. You will need to tighten your seatbelt as you fall into this dream.

-mint-'s 4K difficulty offers a similar taste to the 7K difficulty. Her difficulty packs abrasive technical patterns that require high control and composure. Despite the chaos, the map maintains a consistent structure. In the midst of all the mayhem, will you be able to break out of the daze?

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/mania/flowers.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/962550)

[-MysticEyes](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6253266) outdoes himself once again with his latest installment to the ranked section: in love with a ghost - flowers feat. nori, which is by far his most ambitious set to date, and a new approach that we haven't seen yet from him.

Though the song may seem limiting through its simplicity alone, -MysticEyes is fully aware of this and takes full advantage of it by concrete concepts in the overall design of the map, such as pitch relevancy and repetition which ultimately carry the song much further than anyone could have really anticipated. On top of this, the set also features some other keymodes as well such as 6K, 7K, and even 9K for those looking to expand their horizons onto other keymodes, with [Leniane](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7138602) mapping out the 6K difficulties, as well as [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576) and [Vortex-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4999669) having their own take on the song as well through their 7K difficulties.

Even with these keymodes, these mappers combined incorporate these concepts on their own difficulties and arguably, the higher keymodes is where these concepts shine the most on, making this something we haven't quite seen in the ranked section before. With all that being said, the set is also keysounded, just to make your experience playing the set even more enjoyable than it is already.

The set is incredibly dynamic, meticulously thought out, and even beautiful depending how you look at it and -MysticEyes makes all of this incredibly apparent through this particular mapset. If you're looking for a set which is a lot more toned down than your usual map and is very enjoyable to play, this set might be just for you.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-17-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/mania/knife.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/809495)

Even though this is [Cokiiplay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6760124)'s first bout in the ranked section, he is by no means a new face to the charting scene. He makes this abundantly clear in this chart for Knife that utilizes a fitting technical and meticulous approach. Within it are many elements that show off his charting experience such as deliberate placements of jumps, use of pitch relevance where applicable, and a clear level of repetition that fit extraordinarily well to both the song and the technical approach that was used.

If that wasn't enough, there is also another layer to the meticulous charting scheme that Knife brings to the table, and that comes in how it is experienced while playing. Cokiiplay does a phenomenal job of combining his prowess with intuitive pattern motion that makes it feel like the player is actually making the drum and breakcore sounds in the song. Because of this, the playing experience is made to be extremely satisfying, an element that is very easy to miss when charting. The clear display of deliberate pattern choices with a playing experience that is arguably even better carves Knife a very deserving of his place in the Spotlights!
