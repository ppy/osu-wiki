Let's be honest: the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) isn't anything special — but that may be what makes it so valuable.

This is a plain 'n' simple mapping contest, allowing mappers to show off their talents! (...and earn some [prizes](#rewards) along the way.)

Let's break it down:

## Game modes

This month's contest is open to **osu!** and **osu!mania** mappers.

- [osu! contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/184)
- [osu!mania contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/185)

Next month's contest will feature **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch**.

## Timeline

- **[Beatmapping](#beatmapping) (3 weeks):** Contest is announced and beatmappers create their entries.
- **[Screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) (1.5 weeks):** Entries are evaluated by experienced beatmappers. If there aren't many entries, this will be skipped in favour of a longer judging period.

- **[Rewards](#rewards) (~2 months from now):** Winners are announced at the start of another MBC.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Creating a quality beatmap is a solid goal, but true creativity comes when your tools are restricted.

That's why we're adding **limitations** to this contest!

#### osu! limitation

This month's osu! limitation: **all sliders must be curved.**

More specifically, *every segment of a slider must be curved*. Here's some visual examples to clear things up:

Part of the judging criteria involves how you handle the limitation, so keep that in mind if you're creating [sliders that are *technically curved* yet look exactly like straight sliders](/wiki/shared/news/2023-09-04-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september-2023/technicality.png).

#### osu!mania limitation

osu!mania's contest hosts opted for a more song-focused limitation: **your beatmap's [drain time](/wiki/Beatmap/Drain_time) must be at least *4 minutes*!**

Your biggest struggle might be finding a song packed with enough variation to make a cool beatmap. Luckily, there's *a lot* of songs to choose from:

### Songs

#### osu!

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest!

Feel free to cut longer songs to a length that's easier to map. [Talk to pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) if you need help with that!

#### osu!mania

Due to [osu!mania's limitation](#osu!mania-limitation) this month, any [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) song that is at least 4 minutes is eligible for this contest! [This search filter](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks?is_default_sort=true&sort=update_desc&length%5Bgte%5D=240) includes every song that's 4 minutes or longer, so your song must be in this list!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may vary depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
