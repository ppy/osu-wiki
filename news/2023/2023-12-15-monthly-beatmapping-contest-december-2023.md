Think you have what it takes to be showcased like the mappers above? This month's contest is your chance to prove it.

## Game modes

This month's contest is open to **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch** mappers.

- [osu!taiko contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/192)
- [osu!catch contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/193)

If you'd rather map for another mode, wait 'til January!

## Timeline

- **[Beatmapping](#beatmapping) (3 weeks):** Contest is announced and beatmappers create their entries.
- **[Screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) (1.5 weeks):** Entries are evaluated by experienced beatmappers. If there aren't many entries, this will be skipped in favour of a longer judging period.

- **[Rewards](#rewards) (~2 months from now):** Winners are announced at the start of another MBC.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation/theme

Given this contest's frequency, we have to do *something* to keep it interesting.

Last time, both osu!taiko and osu!catch were rather tame about their restrictions. This time however, they're leaving their comfort zones.

If you're confused about how these work, feel free to ask for clarification in the comments, or send a message to [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=14102976) (for osu!taiko) or [Kimitakari](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=4741164) (for osu!catch).

#### osu!taiko

For osu!taiko, you have one goal: **make a tech map**.

More specifically, the map should make use of varying snap changes within/near patterns to best represent the complexity of fitting songs.

A significant portion of the judging criteria will involve evaluating how well your map fits this *tech* theme, so keep that in mind while you're mapping!

If you're still unclear about what a tech map even is, take a peek at [Zekk - Foresight](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1726306) or [The Flashbulb - Time Ache Finale](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1726133) for some inspiration!

#### osu!catch

While osu!taiko is focused around a theme, osu!catch took a more straightforward approach.

This month's osu!catch limitation: **hyperdashes should only flow either left or right**.

So if your first hyperdash goes to the left, every following hyperdash should too. If your first hyperdash goes to the right, the rest should too.

[Dedot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8805157) gave this a try with their map of [Tokyo Jihen - Sounan](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2067609), so now's your chance to attempt the gimmick in your own way!

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest. Cutting songs is allowed too!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may be higher depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper* [user title](/wiki/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](/wiki/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation/theme](#limitation/theme):**
  - **osu!taiko:** create a tech-themed map
  - **osu!catch:** hyperdashes should only flow either left or right
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias.
