Let's walk back through the past 15 years of osu!, and how various new technologies affected the game and the community.

![]()

Every now and then there's a new piece of tech that's slated to change the way games are played, whether it'd be a new input device, a new way to squeeze more FPS out of your PC, or a whole new way to experience games.

While the osu! community has managed to stay unswayed as things such as virtual reality/augmented reality, cloud gaming & AI advancements cropped up due to them being inapplicable to osu!, there were still some things that changed the way osu! is played, or at least changed the view of the most optimal way to play it.

It's time to dive in and see how technology can impact the community, what the results of widespread adoption are, or could have been.

## Graphics tablets (2007)

osu! originally started out as an *[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan)* clone for PC, which was a game that was exclusive to the Nintendo DS, a console that came, and could be used with the included stylus pen. So when [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) released osu!, it was only natural for players who already had a graphics tablet to try out osu! with it, and since the get-go it was considered a commodity input device that would more closely replicate the original Nintendo DS experience.

Playing with a tablet is a completely different ball game compared to the mouse, but rather than being a direct upgrade by eliminating mouse drift with its absolute positioning, it brings up new challenges and questions regarding its ideal usage. Ideal pen grip, tablet area, dragging or hovering play styles have all been detrimental to increasing the learning curve, which is why some players choose to remain on the much more familiar and intuitive mouse.

Over the years many top players and regular players started switching over from mouse to tablet in order to avoid issues associated with mice, however there have always been top players with both input devices, and they are both considered viable for top-level play, each with its own upsides and downsides.

A great video by community member [Willy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3521482) outlines what's written here and more regarding the usage of tablets as input devices:

## Gaming mechanical keyboards (2010)

Mechanical keyboards have been a thing for decades, however after Razer put [gaming and mechanical switches into a compelling package](https://press.razer.com/product-news/the-worlds-first-mechanical-keyboard-designed-for-gaming-launched-at-gamescom-2010/), that launched the chain reaction that resulted in the mechanical keyboard market we know of today.

By 2010 osu! players were already shifting away from clicking circles with their mouse, to clicking with their Z and X keys, so it would make sense that as these new mechanical keyboards were getting easier and cheaper to adopt into their setups, players would start using them for osu! as well. And while there's nothing stopping anyone from playing osu! with the membrane keyboards, the community at large is suggesting to newer players to purchase a mechanical keyboard, as it provides better feedback when a key is pressed.

The mass adoption of mechanical keyboards did not only occur in the osu! community, but in the gaming community as a whole, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a gaming setup nowadays without one of these smack-dab in the middle of any gamer's desk.

## High refresh rate LCD monitors (2012)

Around mid 2012 first LCD high refresh rate monitors were released with the rates as high as 144hz. Even before LCD monitors were a thing CRT's had the capability of refreshing up to 100hz in most cases (and even higher for high-end models), however with the introduction of high refresh rate LCD panels this technology slowly became much easier to adopt, and is now a staple of any modern gaming setup.

As osu! is a game with high amount of moving elements no matter the game mode (as shown below), high refresh rate monitors quickly became the next most-sought-after commodity piece of gear. While being an upgrade in comparison to 60hz monitors, and some people swearing by high refresh rate monitors helping them read higher approach rates & scroll speeds, it did not stop players who could not afford them from rising through the ranks and some of them even becoming top players such as [FGSky](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2094566), regardless of the refresh rates of their monitor.

## Touch screen's rise and fall (2015-2017)

The earliest mentions of using touch screens as an input device came as soon as the game was released, again due to osu!'s roots as an *Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan* clone. Back then touch screens on PCs were not as prevalent, and most touch screen devices were "Tablet PCs", which were laptops that had a keyboard that can be rotated, folded, or outright detached, along with a touchscreen.

It would take many years for the community to see the true potential of using touch screens in osu!, but starting in 2015 we started seeing glimpses, and eventually the peak of the play style in 2017 with the two players noted below.

### Kuvster (2015)

In 2015, [Kuvster](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4896624) had a unique opportunity — snag the pp record under a very specific set of circumstances. Back in the day "TAG4" maps were [approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved), hence you were able to get pp on them. They weren't playable for a regular player, but if you had a touch screen and were apt with it, you were eligible to grab the pp record, which is what they did:

    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcHiuNcwsiM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The 577pp record was short-lived though, as after this all TAG4 maps were exempt from giving pp, and in 2019 TAG4 maps were moved to the [Loved category](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved). This however is not the event what "killed" touch screen, its demise would come only 2 years later.

### Freedomdiver (2017)

[Freedomdiver](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8482062) joined the osu! community in May 2016, and was your average player, up until the moment they realised they can play osu! with the touch screen on their laptop.

They quickly surged through the ranks after realizing that gaining pp by playing jump maps with a touch screen was easier, but not without garnering negative attention from the community. The community had turned against them, using them as a prime example of why touch screen is unfair, but it wouldn't be until November 2017 when freedomdiver decided to push touch screen to its limits, siding with the community and using actions instead of words to call for a change.

The community somewhat sarcastically rallied around freedomdiver during one night in November, as they proceeded to break the pp record 3 times, all on the infamous [Yuima-ru*World TVver.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/459149#osu/994495) map. Hundreds of players spectated freedomdiver as they broke the pp record, and thanks to [CPUGeek](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4172839) you can experience a snippet of the atmosphere surrounding the play:

    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCU2ZWRj5gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

A month later on December 15th, touch screen scores had their pp reduced, touch screen detection was introduced, and a new touch screen "Touch Device" mod was added, which would reduce the amount of pp gained from jumps on any map.

A unique usage of touch screen nowadays is using it exclusively as an aiming device, while still tapping with the keyboard. For an example of that, you can look at [bonk](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4209965) and their [first person live play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE91EAzRcUo) to see what that looks like.

## "Rapid trigger" feature on mechanical keyboards (2021)

"Rapid trigger" is a new keyboard software feature that's first been implemented by Wooting, a mechanical keyboard manufacturer. Due to its analogue nature made possible by the [hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect), it allows users to modify the position of any key's actuation point, or go beyond the need for a static actuation point altogether by using rapid trigger. The GIF below visually represents how rapid trigger works.

This has caused quite the turmoil amongst the community, as some believe this greatly reduces the skill required to be considered "good at speed", and lowers the skill ceiling quite significantly by allowing players to be less precise with their technique, but still make inputs. The other side of the community argues that this is only beneficial for players who "mash" keys instead of trying to accurately hit notes.

This is still a hotly debated topic, but if you want to get an opinion of a pro player, look no further than [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691)'s video on the rapid trigger feature:

This is a fascinating way to look back through the ages and remind ourselves of a different, simpler time. When the community did not have to worry about the best keyboards and tablets to use to become the best player instantaneously, and just enjoyed osu! for what it is, a rhythm game with an amazing community and one of the largest selections of beat maps in any rhythm game ever.

Or just maybe... I am an angry old man yelling at the clouds... I'll let you be the judge of that.
