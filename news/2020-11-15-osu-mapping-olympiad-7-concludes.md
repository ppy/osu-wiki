Congratulations to **[Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)** and **[Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)**, our two winners! They both managed to get an impressive score of **140.5** despite having quite different scores in each category. 

After a second place on their last Olympiad participation, **[Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)** ties **[Sinnoh](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4236057)** for the first place on the Olympian points leaderboards! Their score on the **Rankability** category clearly shows their ability to provide high-quality content while being original on the side. 

New to this contest, but an osu!mania veteran, **[Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811)**, joins **[Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)**'s step on the first place! They impressed the judges **[Unpredictable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7560872)** and **[Kamuy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7439226)** with their song interpretation and received an outstanding score of 18 out of 20 on the **Song Interpretation** category! 

Let's jump on another spicy tie for the third place! **[lenpai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573)** and **[BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043)** both reached the third place after receiving a score of **138** which is not that far from first place's score! They both scored an excellent score in the Originality category, hitting the highest scores in that category among all the entries!
