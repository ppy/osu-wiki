Need a refresher on the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***)? The [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) explains just about everything you'd need to know.

## Summary

May's contest covered osu!, osu!taiko, and osu!mania, but **only osu!**'s results are being announced for now. The other two modes will be published a bit later, as explained in [the last MBC announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-06-07-monthly-beatmapping-contest-june-2021#schedule). Look out for that soon!

## osu! finalists

Judging is a two-step process. First, we had a team of veteran mappers [screen](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) the contest's **23** entries and deciding the **top 8**. A different team of veteran mappers then [judged](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) the entries, resulting in this big fancy table.

For reference, this contest's [limitation](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-05-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2021#limitation) disallowed slider velocity over 1.40

### Winner

One of osu!'s most prominent mappers of the last couple years [DeviousPanda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4966334) clearly lives up to his *Elite Mapper* title with his first submission to the MBC and **first place win** through [*Masahiro "Godspeed" Aoki - The Game Changer*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1501472).

This entry utilizes the contest's limited SV requirement to its maximum potential by implementing a ton of super slow sections, effectively contrasting with the peak intensity in each kiai. Adding the cherry on top, this was one of the few entries to map the **full 4 minute** version of the song! The extra effort definitely paid off for DeviousPanda this time around and we're looking forward to seeing their future submissions!

### Runner-up

[kuyusu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11758667) took a completely different approach through their **runner-up** entry CS7 map of [*Masahiro "Godspeed" Aoki - Frostbite*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1501495).

By using a small circle size, kuyusu was able to make a map with slow sliders feel considerably less squished than a ton of other entries! Seeing as this entry also won the hearts of screeners with **all 9** of these mappers putting it in their top 5, it's safe to say it worked pretty damn well.

Congratulations again to everyone who participated in May's MBC! **osu!taiko** and **osu!mania** results will be announced at a later time, so look forward to that. Other modes are a bit of a mess in terms of consistent scheduling, but at least **osu!** mappers can rest assured that their mode will stick to the *monthly* aspect of the Monthly Beatmapping Contest!

And of course, we can't forget the screeners and judges who made this possible.
