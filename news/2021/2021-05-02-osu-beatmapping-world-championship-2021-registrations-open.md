Attention to all mappers! osu! Beatmapping World Championship 2021 is on the horizon!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/obwc2021.png)

People say the third time is the charm, and here we are announcing the third iteration of osu! Beatmapping World Championship. We've got to make this one count, everyone!

Having all the judges, participants and guests enjoy the spirit of the contest is the primary goal we've set to achieve. Therefore, we have taken your feedback to heart and applied certain changes to get us closer to this very objective.

Without further ado, let's have a look at what has changed!

## Team Formation

Similar to the last year's edition, teams will be formed based on the country they represent. However, this year, multiple teams can be formed to represent a particular country. If multiple teams are created within a single country, only the team with the highest score amongst them will proceed with the contest upon the first round.

These teams may consist of 3-6 members, where all the members must come from the same country per their osu! profile. Each team can only be created and named by its *Team Captain*, who will act as the primary point of contact between the team and the contest staff. For Captains to form their teams, all participants must be logged in to our website beforehand. Otherwise, they will not be displayed on the *Team Creation* page.

Once their Team Captain selects team members, each member will need to accept the invitation to join that team. Contest staff will later finalise the team creation once everyone accepts their invitation and the team name is approved. Before that, Captains are free to change members and the team name.

## Contest Format

The contest has four rounds. Unlike last year, we will be hosting an **accumulative leaderboard** to grant participating teams more chances to prove themselves.

As mentioned above, only the highest-scoring team of a particular country will participate in the second round. Therefore, we will announce the results of the first round. However, the rest of the results will be kept confidential and will only be announced after the conclusion of the final round, during our livestream. There will be no eliminations after the first round.

Each round, teams will be awarded a certain amount of points by the judges evaluating their entries. Obviously, these hard-earned points will not go to waste! Behind the scenes, these points will be added up with one another in the leaderboard, and the grand total will determine the final placement of the respective team.

### Judges

If you recall, we were previously looking for judges, details of which can be found in [this newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-04-11-osu-beatmapping-world-championship-2021-call-for-judges). We have received dozens of applicants over the span of a few weeks, and for that, we would like to thank you for your interest.

We have closed the osu! mode judge applications for this edition as of today, so if you're a latecomer, try to make it earlier next year. For multi-mode judges (osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania), applications are still open - if you're interested, fill out the [application form](https://forms.gle/Yu2M2ZiwhapJYc7K7) right away!
