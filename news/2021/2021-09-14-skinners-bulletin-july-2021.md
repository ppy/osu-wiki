Fellow skinning enthusiasts, we are delighted to present you with the very first issue of the **Skinners' Bulletin**. Be sure to tune right in and have a read!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/skinners-bulletin.png)

Before moving on, we would like to explain what this newspost is all about briefly. For those who still remember the long-gone Skin Showcase newsposts of the mid-2010s, this bulletin will seem a tad bit familiar yet drastically different at the same time. The Skinners' Bulletin will bring you together with the most delicate skins of the past month, keep you up-to-date with new skinning-related news, and inform you about the monthly statistics.

This issue of the Skinners' Bulletin will contain the following sections:

- [Monthly Statistics](#monthly-statistics)
- [Skin Showcase](#skin-showcase)
- [News & Tips](#news-&-tips)

## Monthly Statistics

As the name suggests, we've gathered all the skinning-related data of the month and compiled them in the form of charts for all those interested.

In July, a total of **45** skins were published on the forum, **26** of which were made out of entirely original assets.

As for the creators of these skins, a total of **41** skinners contributed via their creations. Seeing the new faces forging the majority, we would like to welcome all **25** first-timers aboard!

In place of the dessert, we would like to share some interesting albeit trivial facts with you: In this month, the highest number of skins released by a single person is **2**, and the number of skinners who published that many skins are no more than **4**, leading up to an average of **1.1** skins per skinner overall.

## Skin Showcase

Starting with July 2021, our bulletin will showcase 3 noteworthy skins uploaded within the respective month, each of which will accompany a video. To appear in the forthcoming issues of our bulletin, the skins must abide by the following criteria:

- The skin must have HD support and decent quality, meaning that obvious editing mistakes and heavy artifacts/jagging are not allowed.
- In-game menus and at least one game mode must be fully skinned.
- The skin must be consisting only of original assets. In other words, mixed skins are not allowed.

All the skins of the month qualifying per the criteria above are collected under a list, from which RockRoller and Zeus- pick their favourites. These picks are then compared and eliminated one by one until 3 skins are left.

And that was a brief rundown of how skins to be showcased are selected. Without further ado, here are our picks for this issue:

### Project IRyS

If you're into vtubers, the name might sound quite familiar to you. Named after an English Virtual Singer, [Project IRyS](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1383832) shines amongst its anime-themed counterparts thanks to its minimalistic structure and elegant look. Delicately crafted by none other than [thetasigma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6234482), the skin takes you on a journey across the stars and sparkles throughout your time in the game.

Unlike an average anime-themed skin, Project IRyS focuses much on the trifles and the overall design rather than anime artworks. From dotted lines in `ranking-x-small.png` lining up with both the stars and the gap between leaderboards to the unintrusive inclusion of F-key shortcuts in the bottom right corner, every inch of this skin shows how delicately all the design elements are put in place. Furthermore, the unskinnable elements appearing as unfitting in a typical skin, such as the beatmap/leaderboard filtering options, seem to be adapting to the harmony quite smoothly, owing to IRyS' rich colour palette.

Another fascinating detail can be spotted on the animated `menu-back.png` button conforming to the surroundings exquisitely in both the song selection menu and the results screen. The skin remains relatively standard in gameplay, with some particles like the reverse arrow and the progress bar keeping the overall theme intact. However, pause and fail menu buttons break up the meta by being placed out of the usual layout. What is even more unusual, without a doubt, is the cursive font choice, which is surprisingly fitting alongside other text fonts.

That said, to admire the beauty of this masterpiece first-hand, all it takes is downloading the skin by yourself. But before that, having a look at the showcase video below wouldn't hurt:

### Arknights Ch'en v2.0

Created with care by [Inflique](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13865585), [Arknights Ch'en v2.0](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1365860) ensures you a cyberpunk-esque gaming experience featuring Ch'en from the popular mobile game Arknights. Presenting you with a futuristic song selection panel, the skin makes you feel as if you're in a cockpit of a high-tech spaceship.

Even though just a cursory look might be sufficient to impress many skin curators, the real deal with this skin is undoubtedly the details. Further enhancing the essence of its theme, each and every corner of Arknights Ch'en is full of flavour texts, such as the alert message found on the results screen or the faction logo put in place of the game mode selection button. Moreover, the menu sounds carry out the futuristic theme and contain the character voice lines of Ch'en, maintaining the feeling of playing Arknights by clicking the circles. Alongside everything else, the colour choices fit the environment perfectly, ensuring you a pleasant gaming session inside an exosuit jumped out of a typical sci-fi movie.

Jumping into the playthrough essentially feels like you're starting on a covert mission, especially given the skip button animation behaving like a loading screen. Additionally, pause and fail menus carry this effect further, featuring a massive text that reads "MISSION STILL ONGOING" and "AN ERROR OCCURRED" right behind the options, respectively. In-game elements seem to have preferred minimalism over flamboyance, thereby appealing to the player base to a large extent, yet still manages to keep up with the overall theme. Provided by [Jianshyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9178563), fully skinned osu!mania game mode is included in the package alongside the osu! mode as well.

To summarize, Arknights Ch'en v2.0 is an exceptional skin that bridges the gap between osu! and the Arknights universe professionally, which is just a click away. Enough words uttered, it is time to watch the showcase video and have a feast for the eyes:

### Raiden Shogun - Baal

[Raiden Shogun - Baal](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1381997) revolves around one of the characters from the well-known gacha game, Genshin Impact. Withholding a peaceful and serene theme, Raiden Shogun attributes a misty aura to the user interface with the top-notch help of [pikabrownie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13140446)'s excellence in skinning.

Although the artworks are the main course of action in this skin, they are superbly rendered alongside the minimalistic design. Extending through each menu, the clouds follow you around, putting further emphasis on the mysterious atmosphere. Moreover, when concatenated on the results screen, the modifier icons forming clouds show that the details are also meticulously worked on. Another formidable example would be the level gauge adjusted very well to the theme, contrary to many other skins where the bar would simply be covered up or left as is. As with everything, the menu icons also share the minimalist skin theme, consisting of mere symbols without any textual elements. All of those design features combined with the artworks of Baal create a fabulous ambiance, apprising you of entering an Inazuman territory.

Inside the circle-clicking boundaries, the skin remains relatively player-friendly and straightforward, which exposes the magnificent design of the health bar at the top-left corner. Bordering almost all the elements, including the spinner, dashed and dotted lines boosted the aesthetic a little alongside the clouds. The purple glow preferred for the skip screen combined with the Baal artwork amplifies the concept thanks to its similarities with the Balethunder phenomenon, which Genshin Impact enthusiasts would fall for. As for the pause and fail menus, even though full-screen artwork use tends to knock off the quality of the skin, Raiden Shogun manages to rub them with the menu interface very well.

Last but not least, Raiden Shogun - Baal is one of the perfect examples of how character-orientation and minimalism should be mixed into one. Nonetheless, we are but the messenger, and deciding on the skin that goes well with your taste falls onto your hands, so give its showcase video a go before making a decision:

And that wraps up our skin showcases for July 2021! We'll come back with more of them in the forthcoming issues, but until then, have a look around the rest of the bulletin to enlighten yourself with everything skinning.

## News & Tips

Curious about what is going on within the skinning community? Read all about it right away!

### Completed Skins Compendium Rework

Previously consisting of a long list of skins grouped under 5 prominent categories, the [Completed Skins Compendium](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/686664) has been pulled out of forums and replaced by [a fully operational website](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/ "skinship") on its own. Thanks to its advanced sorting options coupled with the search bar, the new compendium ensures that none of the skins require browsing further than skin-deep!

Although the website is being hosted outside of osu!, the content is based on the [Completed Skins subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/109), meaning that the skins are wholly original and safe-for-work as per the [rules of the Skinning forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/318193).

If you want your skin to be hosted in the new compendium, all you need to do is submitting your skin in the [Completed Skins Queue thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/686672). After that, your skin will be moved to the Completed Skins subforum and thereby added to the compendium.

### Guide: Centring Accuracy

Future skinners extraordinaire, have a read and follow us to the depths of skinning sorcery!

Ever wondered how to locate the accuracy counter at the very center of the playfield? If so, we're here to blow the whistle. Written by the very hands of [tetsui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974678) and [RockRoller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8388854), [the guide of Centring Accuracy](https://skinship.xyz/guides/centring_accuracy "skinship") will teach you how to do so in a couple of ways. With the help of this guide, those merely looking for its practical usage will be able to do so by an eyeball estimate, whilst perfectionists will enjoy a 100% accurate accuracy counter at the very center.

If this gimmick suits your interest as well, this guide is most certainly a must-read!

### Breaking Change: `scorebar-colour.png` size limitation

A recent change has been patched into the stable client which concerns many skinners out there. Previously having no size restrictions, the [`scorebar-colour.png`](/wiki/Skinning/Interface#scorebar) element is now limited to **120px height** (SD), resulting in any excess being chopped off. Unfortunately, as an outcome of this change, there is no way to achieve bottom-aligned scorebars anymore, either.

Since this breaking change might be affecting a wide variety of skins, including yours, we'd like to share a couple of things that may help you fix it:

- Try moving elements to the background layer.
- Locate the animated character to the left of the scorebar rather than below.
