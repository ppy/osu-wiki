See what osu!'s coolest mappers have conjured up and say hello to our newest Elite Mapper!

What's the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***), you ask? Insanely creative minds here at osu! gave the MBC its name because it's a mapping contest that runs monthly. See the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) for all the details!

April's contest covered **osu!**, **osu!taiko**, and **osu!catch**. That means we have a lot to cover, so we'll start with a summary of winners/prizes, then move on to more detailed results for each game mode.

## Summary

## osu! winners

Winner selection is a 2 step process. First, our team of experienced mappers [screened](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) **32** entries and decided the **top 7**. Second, a different team of experienced mappers [judged](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) those 7 entries based on the criteria below.

### Winner

A long-time mapper who's only recently delved into the MBC scene, [- Frontier -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4314710) impressed just about everyone with their entry of [*MYUKKE. - Ginevra*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1471067). He fully utilized the contest's "red anchor sliders only" theme in conjunction with his already creative slidershape choices, leading to a clear **first place win** in the judging bracket.

Judges weren't the only mappers fawning over this map. **9 of the 10 screeners** put - Frontier -'s submission in their top 5, easily finalizing it as the **screener's pick**!

### Runner-up

With more than a year's worth of MBC submissions under his belt, [Acylica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309) landed in the modest **runner-up** position with his rendition of [*MYUKKE. - Ginevra*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1471903).

Although he's not in the #1 spot, silver was all that Acylica needed to push him over the edge to becoming the fourth *Elite Mapper* crowned through the MBC! Having won in different categories four months in the past, just about anyone can vouch for this contest veteran's prowess.

With [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) earning his *Elite Mapper* last month and Acylica this month, the [2021 MBC prophecy](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-03-07-monthly-beatmapping-contest-march-2021) (written under "prizes") says that [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) earns it next month. We'll be waiting.

## osu!taiko winners

Similar to osu!'s judging approach, osu!taiko began by a team of [screeners](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) narrowing down the massive collection of **55** entries to the **top 10**, which were then [judged](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) by a panel of 8 drum-bashing experts. Due to the limited number of screeners, we decided not to provide the "screener's pick" reward for this contest.

### Winner

To cap out the 2nd iteration of the osu!taiko MBC, we have another relatively lesser known Thai mapper taking the top spot: [KappuChinooo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9582525)!

Their entry of [*MYUKKE. - Ginevra*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1468820) opts to use a more diverse selection of rhythms, combining 1/6 and 1/8 to create a standout experience even in the context of this less-than-standout limitation. He's produced excellent work and further proves the hidden Thaiko supremacy that many people are yet to realize!

### Runner-up

The **runner-up** this month is [uone](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5321719), who executed a super pleasant wavy SV idea in his version of [*MYUKKE. - Ginevra*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mt5tpb9kqo9vtsf/radar%20%28suffering%29%20-%20Creative%20Dolphin.osz?dl=0). The map includes patterns that play incredibly well, which should be no surprise considering his playing skill and mapping history. He deserves a big congratulations as well!

## osu!catch winners

With a humble **14** entries, osu!catch skipped straight to the judging phase for all its entries!

### Winner

The long-awaited **winner** of the first iteration of osu!catch MBC is [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114)!

Having already established his status as a celebrated veteran in the mapping community, autofanboy showcased his experience in his rendition of [*MYUKKE. - Ginevra*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1471164), resulting in a beautifully-crafted beatmap that captivated the judges. Its intricate flow used this month's limitation more like a tool to explore ideas only viable in a no-slider map, rather than an obstacle that they had to map around. Make sure to give this wonderful map a try!

### Runner-up

Our **runner-up** is [rew0825](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2488026).

Their map of [*MYUKKE. - OCCHOCO-REST-LESS*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1471162) is simply addicting to run through. Every pattern feels satisfying to hit and the overall playfulness and design of the map was so fitting to the song itself, leaving a strong impression on the judges!
