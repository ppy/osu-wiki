Try your hand at this month's slow-slider-themed contest with a chance to become osu!'s next *Elite Mapper*!

May's [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) includes opportunities for [**osu!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/127), [**osu!taiko**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/128), and [**osu!mania**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/129) mappers. Maybe next month we'll cover every mode at the same time, who knows?

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (2.5 weeks):** Contests are announced at the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- [**Screening (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Judging (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Rewards:**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including fancy profile badges and the legendary *Elite Mapper* title!

Expert mathematicians might notice that this whole schedule doesn't fit within a month. We announce results for each contest halfway through the following month, meaning May's contest results will be published mid-June.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

We have two goals here at MBC headquarters: to create mapping contests every month and to ensure those contests aren't repetitive. It's a tough act to balance, which is why we have **limitations** — mapping restrictions that submissions need to follow, like "straight sliders only" or "circles cannot be used" or "you must map with your eyes closed". We unfortunately haven't tried that last one yet.

Below are the limitations for this month!

**[osu! MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/127) limitations:**

- Total slider velocity (SV) cannot be higher than **1.4**

What's "total slider velocity"? It's not an official term, but we're talking about a map's **base SV** (set in the Timing tab of the editor) combined with any **SV multipliers** (green lines set in the `F6` timing panel).

So for example:

- If base SV is **1.4**, SV multipliers can't be higher than **1x**. (1.4 x 1 = 1.4 "total SV")
- If base SV is **2.8**, your multipliers can't be higher than **0.5x** (2.8 x 0.5 = 1.4 "total SV").

Pretty straightforward, right? For those who'd rather not think, the default base SV is 1.4, so don't touch that and only use SV multipliers below 1x. You'll be fine.

**[osu!taiko MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/128) limitation:**

- All patterns on snaps faster than 1/2 must have an **even** number of notes.

If you're brave enough to map anything other than a swing song with this limitation, we'll give them an honorary 0.01 MBC points for the attempt.

**[osu!mania MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/129) limitation:**

- Long notes cannot be used.

Entries must be 4K or 7K maps, meaning that 5K, 6K, 8K, 9K, and 10K entries are excluded from this edition.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is guitar savant [**Masahiro "Godspeed" Aoki**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/136). These three songs are available for mapping in the osu!, osu!taiko, and osu!mania contests:

## Rules

Breaking any of these rules will land you in MBC prison. Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation) for the contest's mode:**
    - **osu!:** Total slider velocity cannot be higher than 1.4
    - **osu!taiko:** All patterns on snaps faster than 1/2 must have an **even** number of notes.
    - **osu!mania:** Long notes cannot be used.
- **be in `.osz` format.** Including a background image and custom hitsounds is fine, but skin/storyboard/video content will not be considered.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.
- **be a 4K or a 7K entry for osu!mania.**

## Submission

You've got a bit under **3 weeks** to prepare your masterpiece of a map! Once it's ready, head over to the relevant contest listing to submit:
