Aiming to become osu!'s next *Elite Mapper*? Whip out your creative muscles in this month's square-pattern themed mapping contest!

June's [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) includes opportunities for [**osu!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/130) and [**osu!catch**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/131) mappers. Next month we'll likely opt out osu!catch for osu!taiko and osu!mania, so stick around for that!

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (2.5 weeks):** Contests are announced near the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- [**Screening (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Judging (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Rewards (announced mid-July):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including fancy profile badges and the legendary *Elite Mapper* title!

Smaller game modes don't run contests as frequently, so they've also chosen to extend their judging time by a month. That said, May's osu!taiko and osu!mania contest results will likely be announced in mid-July as well!

## Beatmapping

### Theme

A **limitation** is a mapping restriction that every submission needs to follow, like "star rating cannot exceed 4.00" or "circles only". These keep the MBC fresh by ensuring each month isn't the same old contest.

Limitations are how we *usually* handle this, but both contests this month are switching things up with much looser **themes** instead.

There's no objectively correct way to handle themes, so we're hoping to see what cool ideas you can come up with!

**[osu! MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/130) theme:** square patterns

Yep, that's it.

Your map should be focused on **square patterns**. A clear focus on squares and engaging execution of different square-like patterns will play a significant role in the judging phase of the contest!

**[osu!catch MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/131) theme:** 1/1 rhythm gaps

A "1/1 rhythm gap" is considered any rhythm where 2 objects are separated by 1 beat in the timeline with nothing in between.

Whether it's a walk, a hyperdash, or anything in between, *any* type of 1/1 transition works for this theme! Just like square patterns in osu!'s contest, engaging execution and patterns using this rhythmic theme will have notable weight in the judging phase of this osu!catch contest.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is rhythm game extraordinaire [**Tanchiky**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/144). Pick any of these songs for your submission in the osu! or osu!catch contests.

## Rules

Breaking any of these rules will land you in MBC prison. Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping theme](#theme) for the contest's mode:**
  - **osu!:** square patterns
  - **osu!catch:** 1/1 rhythm gaps
- **be in `.osz` format.** Including a background image and custom hitsounds is fine, but skin/storyboard/video content will not be considered.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.

## Submission

A little less than **3 weeks** remain. As per tradition, we expect everyone to start and finish their maps 2 days before the deadline. When that time comes around, here's where you'll need to go to submit your map:

- [osu! contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/130)
- [osu!catch contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/131)

May's contest results for osu! will be out in a couple weeks. For osu!taiko and osu!mania, expect to wait an extra month!

See you soon!
