## osu! results

This month's contest was themed around [blankets](/wiki/Mapping_techniques/Blanket)!

During the [screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) process, experienced mappers narrowed down the contest's **20+** entries to **5** finalists. These 5 entries were thoroughly evaluated by a different team of [judges](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging), resulting in the... uh, results!

| Rank | Beatmap | Judging | Musical representation (50) | Creativity (50) | Gameplay (50) | Theme (50) | Total (standardized/raw) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

### Winners

In unprecedented MBC history, we have a tie between two entries in both screening *and* judging!

Sort of.

On the [screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) side, both entries received completely equal praise. On the [judging](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) side, both entries received the same *raw* scores, but *standardized* scores tell a different story.

We won't bore you with the math, but [phyr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13181574)'s entry scored lower because it was less unanimously praised among the judges. More specifically one judge *really* liked the map, while support for [Aistre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380)'s submission was closer to unanimous.

Regardless of how you put it, both [Aistre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380) and [phyr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13181574) had top tier performances with their beatmaps of [*FORViDDEN ENERZY*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634441) and [*Faith of Eastward*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1635828)! Give each of them a quick round of applause and let's hope to their rise as *Elite Mappers* in next year's mapping contests!

## osu!taiko results

This contest had a particularly difficult limitation: *All patterns on snaps faster than 1/2 must have an **even** number of notes.*

![](/wiki/shared/news/2021-05-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2021/taiko-examples.png)

Unlike osu!, osu!taiko operates without [screening](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening). Instead, all entries undergo ordinary [judging](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) and are ranked accordingly!

| Rank | Beatmap | Judging | Structure (40) | Creativity (40) | Gameplay (40) | Limitation (20) | Total (standardized/raw) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

### Winner

Ending Thailand's osu!taiko win streak and ultimately crossing the Finnish line is the one and only [Jaltzu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2597417)!

His incredibly well-structured entry of [*busy come, busy go*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634847) resonated with judges in all categories, while also offering players an especially difficult challenge in the map's kiai section.

### Runner-up

However, it's clear the Thai-ko mappers aren't done with us yet. [Ph0eNiiXZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9463721) secures the **runner-up** spot and is the first osu!taiko mapper to win twice in the osu!taiko MBC!

His entry of [*busy come, busy go*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634263) opted for relatively more slider velocity changes and slightly simpler patterns, but don't let simplicity disguise the expertise behind this entry.

## osu!catch results

**5** judges. **1** winner. And a runner-up, I suppose.

This contest focused on **1/1 rhythm gaps**! For those of you who aren't mappers, a "1/1 rhythm gap" is essentially a 1 beat separation between two hit objects. Most Insane and Expert difficulties use these sparingly, so see how osu!catch mappers executed whole beatmaps around this concept:

| Rank | Beatmap | Judging | Musical representation (50) | Creativity (50) | Gameplay (50) | Theme (50) | Total (standardized/raw) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| \#1 | [*REDOUT*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634189) by [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=60e21c421f02780e58fa28f5) | 41 | 40 | 40 | 42 | **4.89** (**163**) |
| \#2 | [*REDOUT*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g-ynzOkDh61AakZxNw_WgzAF0eeArF1Y/view?usp=sharing) by [Unlucky_w](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4820793) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=60e21c421f02780e58fa28f7) | 39 | 40 | 40 | 40 | **4.4** (**159**) |
| \#3 | [*REDOUT*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634184) by [Secre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2306637) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=60e21c421f02780e58fa28fe) | 35 | 33 | 38 | 41 | **2.61** (**147**) |
| \#4 | [*Voice*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634222) by [rew0825](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2488026) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=60e21c421f02780e58fa28fc) | 38 | 31 | 35 | 40 | **2.19** (**144**) |
| \#5 | [*REDOUT*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634262) by [Dika312](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/741613) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=60e21c421f02780e58fa2900) | 36 | 37 | 33 | 33 | **1.87** (**139**) |

See results for all submissions [here](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?contest=60e2199b535d4f3b27846da0).

### Winner

Winning with his entry of [*REDOUT*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634189) is none other than osu!catch veteran [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134)!

An innovative mapper well known in the catch community, Jemzuu wasted no opportunity and promptly accepted this month's challenge — and boy did he deliver! Striking a clear balance between this month's theme and his usual technical style, he managed to create a harmonious experience that unquestionably impressed our judges!

### Runner-up

And our osu!catch runner-up is [Unlucky_w](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4820793) with their entry of [*REDOUT*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g-ynzOkDh61AakZxNw_WgzAF0eeArF1Y/view?usp=sharing)!

This may come as a surprise to a few mappers. Unlucky_w is a fairly new name to the osu!catch community, but they have been actively putting the work to get involved to advance their mapping, and as showcased by their spectacular performance, it is certainly paying off! Utilizing a rather unorthodox interpretation of our month's theme, they managed to capture the attention of our judges and achieve a considerably high score.

## osu!mania results

Sticking to a simpler limitation than other game modes, osu!mania's contest **disallowed long notes**!

While this was restrictive, it still permitted a lot of different types of maps, as clearly seen by the contest's top submissions. Check them out for yourself:

See results for all submissions [here](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?contest=60aff4f97edff1508cf083a5).

### Winner

Despite focusing on 7K rather than the mainstream 4K keymode, [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754) is one of osu!mania's most competent and influential mappers, proven by their winning submission of [*busy come, busy go*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634843)!

The beatmap takes full advantage of the contest's limitation while implementing spectatularly smooth patterning. Balancing every aspect of design, Kawawa's creation here sets a definite precedent on rice-only patterning for 7K.

### Runner-up

Not far behind, [lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052) is another osu!mania legend who's proven themselves with their 4K entry of [*Frostbite*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1634244)!

Anyone who's participated in osu!mania tournaments knows the magic behind lemonguy. His beatmaps are tightly structured and utilize patterning that the judges found exceptional — especially demonstrated by his special variant of jumpstreams featured throughout the beatmap.

## Wrap-up

We'd like to extend a huuuuuuuuuge congratulations to every winner in these contests! Mappers from *certain game modes* have been rioting outside osu! HQ demanding results for quite a while, so we're happy to finally publish the winners. Better late than never, right?

And with that, we'll be departing from official mapping contests until 2022!

We're hoping to launch a particularly special contest soon, but we'll leave details of that for when it's ready. In the meantime, look forward to the next year of Monthly Beatmapping Contests and have fun mapping!
