July's [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is for **osu!** only. View the contest listing [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/132) and stay tuned for other modes in the coming months!

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (2.5 weeks):** Contests are announced near the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.

- [**Judging (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers for each mode.

## Beatmapping

### Theme

Do you consider yourself a diverse mapper? I hope so, because this month's theme is all about contrast.

*The MOST IMPORTANT RULE in this contest*: **you must map TWO (very short) songs.**

Judges will evaluate each map separately aside from the "theme" category. This score will be assigned based on how well your two maps show a difference in style between one another.

That said, your goal is to map each song in distinctly different ways (and ensure that both are solid maps, of course!).

### Songs

Song choices come from our [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) as per usual. You must map **any two** of the songs below:

#### Thaehan - Insert Coin (0:38 / 178 BPM)

To make things easier, [**download this beatmap template including every song**](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/132/template.osz)! You can map whichever two songs you choose, then export the `.osz` for submission on the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/132).

## Rules

Time for the nitty gritty. Submissions must...

- **contain TWO maps using any of the month's [selected songs](#songs).** Please don't map more than two songs.
- **be in `.osz` format.** Including a background image and custom hitsounds is fine, but skin/storyboard/video content will not be considered.
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.

## Submission

You've got about **3 weeks** to stretch your mapping muscles then submit to the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/132).

And in case you missed it, use the [beatmap template for every applicable song](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/132/template.osz). It'll save you a lot of trouble since the contest listing only allows one file submission.

That's all for now! Good luck mapping and we'll see you with the results from last month's contest soon!
