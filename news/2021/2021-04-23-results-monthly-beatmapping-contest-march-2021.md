The jury is in! Results for last month's osu! and osu!taiko mapping contests are here, along with our newest Elite Mapper!

Unsure how the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) works? Unsure what the MBC even is? Conveniently the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) covers everything, including how contest winners are selected and their prizes!

## osu! winners

A team of experienced mappers (we like to call them [screeners](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening)) narrowed down the **43** total submissions we received to the **top 8**. A different group of experienced mappers (aptly called [judges](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging)) scrutinized the top entries and gave them category-based scores.

Here's how it turned out:

| Rank | Beatmap | Judging | Musical representation (60) | Creativity (60) | Gameplay (60) | Limitation (30) | Total |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| \#1 | [*Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439466) by [Innovation](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304412) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=606268ab6a56d154dccc5617) | 49 | 44 | 49 | 25 | **167** |

| \#5 | [*Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439354) by [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=606268a46a56d154dccc55e3) | 42 | 41 | 39 | 12 | **134** |

### Winner

An underdog among contest veterans, [Innovation](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304412) is this month's **winner** with a stellar map of [*Se-U-Ra - Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439466)!

While most entries tried to avoid the "no 1/4 sliders allowed" limitation by shortening sliders to 1/8, Innovation's entry opted for rhythms that didn't even closely resemble 1/4 slider workarounds. You could even call the map *innovative* (but you really shouldn't — get some new joke material).

Given it's their first MBC win, Innovation has earned the first tier MBC profile badge!

### Runner-ups

Yep, there's two! Final scores (both raw and standardized) were practically tied for both [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515)'s [*Traveler \~stand aloof\~*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439562) and [Oriental](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16142512)'s [*Se-U-Ra - Melusia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439439), so both received the **runner-up** position this month. Going forward we'll be trying some new tiebreaker methods for cases like this, so stay tuned for that possibility.

Despite scoring similarly, these maps couldn't be more different. Oriental's is a high-effort storyboard/skinning/keysounding/concept-mapping moshpit that would've scored considerably higher if it actually focused on the "no 1/4 sliders" limitation. Meanwhile, Mao's nearly 7-star entry was a riskier mapping venture featuring "incredibly based doubles" according to screener [Chugger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4491713).

The runner-up spot isn't enough to earn Oriental any prizes, but Mao was on the cusp of earning the ***Elite Mapper*** title and this finally pushed him over the edge. Congratulations to Mao for joining [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) and [xbopost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6842421) as mappers who've earned this prestigious title through the Monthly Beatmapping Contest!

### Screening crew #1

And last but definitely not least, [Acylica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309)'s [*Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439570) earned a nearly universal gut reaction of "awesome map" from the [screening crew](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening), with **9 of the 11** screeners putting the map in their top 5.

For those keeping count, this is Acylica's third time achieving the screening crew's #1 pick. That, paired with his two runner-up positions in past contests, makes him just 1 point shy of the *Elite Mapper* title. Could he be the first mapper to earn the title without actually *winning* the MBC? Is such a thing even possible? Seriously, this situation is insanely awkward, but we'll see how things progress and hope for a proper win from Acylica one of these days.

In case all this talk of "points" has you confused, the MBC wiki article's [rewards section](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) is worth a read. Trust me.

## osu!taiko winners

osu!taiko took a different judging approach. Each of the **23** submissions was evaluated by the entire judging panel, so screening wasn't a factor.

Here's the top 5 osu!taiko submissions:

| Rank | Beatmap | Judging | Musical representation (80) | Creativity (80) | Gameplay (80) | Limitation (40) | Total |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| \#1 | [*Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439782) by [Ph0eNiiXZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9463721) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=6062691e6a56d154dccc564b) | 66 | 60 | 62 | 36 | **224** |
| \#2 | [*Melusia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439869) by [Nifty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4956097) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=606269236a56d154dccc5674) | 65 | 53 | 65 | 33 | **216** |
| \#3 | [*Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1440121) by [3san](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8050850) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=6062691e6a56d154dccc5646) | 61 | 60 | 57 | 34 | **212** |
| \#4 | [*Melusia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1440236) by [realy0_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8863359) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=6062691f6a56d154dccc5658) | 59 | 60 | 56 | 32 | **207** |
| \#5 | [*Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1440030) by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767) | [see details](https://mappersguild.com/contests/results?submission=606269226a56d154dccc566f) | 57 | 51 | 55 | 33 | **196** |

### Winner

An unexpected but welcome surprise, [Ph0eNiiXZ](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9463721) takes the gold with his expertly crafted entry of [*Empuxa*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439782#taiko/2962358)! This map combines great playability with excellent use of this month's challenging limitation, pushing its boundaries to create a super nice slow-slider-velocity-based map.

Congratulations to Ph0eNiiXZ for receiving the MBC profile badge! We'll see if they're aiming for the coveted *Elite Mapper* too.

### Runner-up

On the other hand, we have a mapper who should come as no surprise at all. [Nifty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4956097) further proves his skill at crafting an SV map with his entry of [Melusia](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1439869#taiko/2962530). This entry combines Nifty's classic smooth slider velocity usage, comfortable patterning, and overall creative flair. All of this came together in a way that supposedly brought one of our judges to tears.

Nifty is halfway towards receiving the MBC profile badge. Another win could be enough — well done!
