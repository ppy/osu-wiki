Back from hiatus, the Monthly Beatmapping Contest returns with tough design limits and precious prizes — now featuring competition for other modes too!

It may be hard to believe, but the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is a series of mapping contests that recur monthly. Well, that's what the MBC was between January and October of 2020. We took a break while [A Labour of Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/115) was underway, but submissions for that are now closed, so it's about time we bring back our bread and butter mapping contests!

Special to 2021, we're now giving mappers of other game modes opportunities to participate! We'll start this month with parallel osu! and osu!taiko contests, then next month we'll either swap out osu!taiko for osu!catch or run 3 modes at once.

Anyway, let's recap how this contest works:

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (3 weeks):** Contests are announced at the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- [**Screening (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Judging (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Rewards:**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed.

Because this sums up to ~6 weeks, you'll see results for March's contests *after* April's contests begin.

## Prizes

The MBC offers three ways to "win", each of which rewards a certain amount of points:

- **Judging winner** (2 points)
- **Judging runner-up** (1 point)
- **Screening crew's #1 pick** (1 point)

These points carry over between each month's contests. By reaching certain point thresholds, you can earn different prizes:

- **osu!supporter** (1 month per point)
- **MBC profile badge** (different badges at 2, 4, and 6 point thresholds)
- ***Elite Mapper* forum title** (6 points)

In case you're confused, the [MBC wiki page](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) covers the rewards in more detail. This page also shows how [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405), [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515), and [Acylica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309) are only inches away from the *Elite Mapper* prize, so you'd be wise to bet that they're submitting to this month's contest.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

A monthly competition would be pretty stale without something to mess with mappers. We handle this with *limitations*, which are basically ways to limit map design. Some examples of limitations are *circles cannot be used* and *star rating cannot exceed 4.00*, both of which hugely impact map creation.

Because we're technically running *two* contests this month (one for each mode), we have *two* sets of limitations.

**[osu! MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/120) limitation:**

- sliders cannot be 1/4 of a beat long

**[osu!taiko MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/121) limitations:**

- All slider velocity changes used cannot exceed 0.80x
- Base slider velocity cannot exceed 1.4x
- At least 1 slider velocity change via an inherited point must be used

And just to be super clear about the osu! limitation: 1/4 sliders with reverse arrows are not allowed, while a 1/8 slider with a reverse arrow is. This limitation is focused on the length of the original slider, like [this limitation from last year](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-06-04-monthly-beatmapping-contest-june#limitation).

Major props to [radar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7131099) for organizing and deciding the limitation for osu!taiko's contest. Hopefully taiko mappers don't find his limitation too cruel, unlike standard osu! mappers who surely will find the "no 1/4 sliders" limitation obnoxious.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

We're kicking things off with rhythm-game legend [**Se-U-Ra**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/112). These three songs are available for mapping in both the osu! and osu!taiko contests:

#### Empuxa (204 BPM)

## Rules

Your mind is running rampant with mapping ideas, we get it. Here's the rules you need to follow for **both contests**:

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation) for the contest's mode:**
    - **osu!:**
        - sliders cannot be 1/4 of a beat long
    - **osu!taiko:**
        - All slider velocity changes used cannot exceed 0.80x
        - Base slider velocity cannot exceed 1.4x
        - At least 1 slider velocity change via an inherited point must be used
- **be in `.osz` format.** Including a background image and custom hitsounds is fine, but storyboard/video content will not be considered.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.

## Submission

Both contests are accepting entries for **3 weeks!** Head to the [osu! contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/120) or the [osu!taiko contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/121) to submit your entry (or entries, if you're insane enough to try both!).

That's all for now! See you next month and have fun mapping.
