Leaving those who couldn't predict his presence with a wide-open mouth, [Unpredictable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7560872) has recently joined the osu!mania NAT!

Having worn the purple uniform for roughly one and a half years, Unpredictable has rolled up his sleeves to partake in the evaluation of his fellow nominators. Too soon, you might think? Definitely not! He is more than ready and up to the task, and we're excited to finally have him on board.

### NAT Resignations

Our personal office cat [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) has decided to step down from the duties of the NAT after more than 5 years. We thank him a lot for all his contributions to the game and we wish him all the best for the future!

### BN Departures

## Mappers' Showcase

Into the next round of the Mappers' Showcase we go! This time, we're featuring two amazing hidden gems from the osu!catch game mode. Big thanks to this month's contributors [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and [autofanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114).

### Verti

[Verti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10674528) is an ambitious newcomer to the osu!catch mapping scene. His mapping prowess should not be underestimated as he managed to push three maps to the ranked section within three months, achieving the impossible as deemed by most novice mappers.

His debut map is [nonoc – Memento (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1417543), a Cup to Rain spread mapped solely by himself, for which the ranking process only lasted a month. He has been gaining recognition from the osu!catch community with his 4-minute Platter to Overdose spread [Amatsuki – DORAEMON]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1327531) starred in CWC2021 as a Finals DT pick.

He may be keen on producing maps for Japanese vocals, yet he is currently opening up new vista on trance and rhythm game music such as [xi – Ascension to Heaven]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1482069), a collaboration project with his mapping mentor, as well as [Morimori Atsushi vs. uma – Noel (long ver.)]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1483009), a clean Overdose marathon featuring intense streams, consistent patterns and on-point hitsounds. Verti has certainly set a prime example to fellow newcomers that self-motivation can bring you further than expected.

### KuroRev

A veteran mapper who's been crafting maps for 5 years now, [KuroRev](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6581584) is a virtuoso when it comes to intuitive flow, delivering natural gameplay and bestowing great satisfaction to players. Given his vast experience, it is no question that he certainly knows what he's doing in the editor.

Recently breaching through the ranked section, he finally propels ahead with his rendition of [Asriel - Kegare Naki Yume](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/710899) which features a simple yet captivating style with its pleasing aesthetic and coherent representation of the music. In similar fashion, his take on [sokoninaru - Tenohira de odoru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1200657) presents clean-looking streams and apt spacing usage to emphasize the music accordingly.

Other than being a hard rock mapper himself, KuroRev has also been endeavouring to push his first full solo set with the lovely future bass song [YUC'e - Cinderella Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1467712), showcasing his mastery on movement and immaculate pattern structure. If you do like his maps, consider clicking that bell on his profile to not miss out on his later bangers. We are eager to see his motivation grow further and hopefully see him create more interesting maps!

## Mapping Contests

Another month of community-hosted contests is upon us, this time with something sweet for all osu!taiko and osu!catch mappers with some really great prizes. Don't know how to map in either mode? That doesn't matter — you should try your luck anyway! Who knows, you may discover some hidden master mapper talent hiding within you.

### osu!flushed Taiko Mapping Contest

The [osu!flushed Taiko Mapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1342681) is a brand new contest where the responsibility of choosing the song falls onto your hands. That's right, you will have an *almost* complete freedom in song choice, where the only restriction is that it needs to follow a certain theme.

As for the prizes, the winner gets 6 months of osu!supporter, while the runners-ups of 2nd and 3rd place receive 4 months of osu!supporter.

Don't wait for the drums to roll — go ahead and sign yourself up via the thread above to show who places the blues and reds the best!

### osu!catch 2021 Summer Featured Artist Cup

As the summer cracks the door open, the fruits start ripening. To fill your cup with the cream of the crop, be sure to join the [osu!catch Featured Artist Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1327798) right away!

Featuring songs from our [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) who joined the lineup between March 20th - June 20th, this contest will test your mapping capabilities in two difficulties: one being Platter or lower, and the other being Rain or higher.

But that's not all — this one has some hefty prizes too!

The winner will be rewarded with 100 USD in cash, plus having their set modded by the host and the judges! Should you not make it to the top, the runners-up will still get 20 USD in cash in addition to 4 months of osu!supporter for 2nd place, and the 3rd place will enjoy 2 months of osu!supporter.

Unfortunately, the sign-ups have just been closed. However, you may take a seat and watch along the fruit pickers duelling with the songs of our beloved Featured Artists.

### osu!catch Mapping World Cup 2021

Brought to you by the osu!catch mapping grand-master [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) for the third time, the [osu!catch Mapping World Cup 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1350409) will have the best mappers from all over the globe gather around and have an intense competition that will determine the next osu!catch Mapping Champions!

Needless to say, such a contest is not going to be without prizes, but all the details on that matter are currently work-in-progress. To keep track of the updates and learn more about the contest, we highly suggest you to check the [forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1350409), and dive right into the [o!CMWC Discord server](https://discord.gg/eTUFAjf).

Alright, osu!catch folks! Hopefully, we've made your day with these two majestic contests, but make sure to compete responsibly, since you wouldn't want to... *overdose* on fruit juice after all, would you?

## Around the Community

Here's what's been going down in the community lately:

### Guide to making your first osu!mania 10K beatmap

Not so long ago, osu!mania got a new key-mode. After a long wait, 10K beatmaps can finally be ranked, and that's exactly what people need right now. But where does one start in mapping 10K? The same question came up on the 10K+ Rhythm Game Community server and so they gathered and created their own guide!

The 10K community representative [\[Sick\]Catcat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11544934) has posted their [10K osu!mania Mapping Guide](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1336072) in the osu!mania subforum with everything you need to know to start mapping 10K osu!mania, covering anything from various pattern structures to useful tips and tricks in Easy to Hard difficulties.

If this has piqued your interest, slap your favourite song into the editor and start mapping — everybody knows that 10K osu!mania is in urgent need of more ranked beatmaps, after all. And should you need more help, the [10K+ Rhythm Game Community](https://discord.gg/PwzcUzk) would be more than happy to assist.

### osu! Featured Artist Compilation Blind Beatmap Collab

Now, let's take a moment for ourselves and admire the wonderful (and aptly named) collaborative effort the community has put forward, because [**this is where we are, and what unites us**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1483077#osu/3041896).

Hosted by the talented mapper and modder [Nuvolina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974170), the blind collab project features an hour-long medley composed of minute sections from various Featured Artist tracks delicately compiled by [ModlesS\_Flash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5113095).

And of course, such a massive project wouldn't have been left without a showcase stream! The VOD is available below for those who have missed it or wish to fall under its spell once again:

<iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=1051031340&parent=osu.ppy.sh&autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="100%"></iframe>

And that's it for this month! Good thing we didn't promise anything last time because we are once again late, but we expect things to start winding down now throughout the rest of the year, so we should be back on track with more timely mapping morsels for you to gobble up in newspost form.

As always, should you have any spicy details anything mapping or modding related, be it guides, podcasts or videos, please let us know! We would love to touch upon them in the next issue of Mappers' Report, and we can't do that if we don't know about them.

You can either directly contact [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717) or drop by in the `#mappers-report` channel on the [osu! community Discord server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H). Hope to see you there soon!

Thank you for reading, stay safe and healthy!
