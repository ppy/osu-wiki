Project Loved is here to cap off the summer with some of the hottest maps from the community!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/project-loved.jpg)

For those unfamiliar, Project Loved hosts community voting polls each month to decide which beatmaps get added to the [Loved category](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=loved). All of the maps are chosen by the Loved Captains of their respective gamemodes. Each banner will redirect you to the respective beatmap's poll, or you can immediately view them all on the forum [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). The voting process lasts for 10 days, so don't forget to cast your votes! More info about this project is available on the [wiki page](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved)!

Before moving on to the August picks, we would like to thank you for your immense voting participation during the July round of Project Loved! We hope you are enjoying the newest additions to the Loved category. If you would like to view the results from the previous round, you may do so by clicking the following links:

This month we have a plethora of news to share with everyone! The [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh), maintained by [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350), is slowly beginning to take shape as the [submissions](https://loved.sh/submissions/osu), [submission system](https://loved.sh/submit) and [mapper consents](https://loved.sh/mappers) pages have gone live! Starting now, you may view and submit beatmaps for Loved through the official Project Loved website! There's still much to be done, but contributions are always welcome! If you wish to help us out with the ongoing development efforts, the open-source code for the website is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cl8n/project-loved-web).

On top of that, the [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Project_Loved_Team) has seen many departures and new faces show up recently. Coming in from the Global Moderation Team to assist with reviewing beatmap content and Project Loved's day-to-day tasks, we have [Pachiru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2850983) joining Project Loved as a coordinator! Alongside them comes [UberFazz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8646059), someone you might have already seen active during July's round! Hailing from the prestigious Beatmap Nominators group, they are here to assist with ensuring that all beatmap metadata going into Loved is as accurate and correct as it can be!

However, one of our osu!mania captains is sadly retiring from their duties, as [Pope Gadget](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341) bids Project Loved farewell. Being one of the pioneer captains for osu!mania, we thank them for their contributions to the Loved category and wish them the best of luck in their future endeavours!

With all of that being said, here are the picks for the month of August!

[papiyon feat. Hatsune Miku - White Prism](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/671140#osu) by [Arieruco](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1811271)\
172 BPM, 3:26 | 6.21★\
*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

An extremely popular map, Arieruco's *White Prism* has amassed over 400 favourites in the years it's been submitted, and for good reason. The unrelenting flow aim patterns at 172 BPM make this map a challenge for even the best players to play consistently, compounded by the cutstreams and an occasional rhythm change here and there. It's a heap of fun to attempt, especially since it's coupled with an absolute earworm of a song — it would be very easy to lose half an hour or more to attempting a play on this map. Why not give it a go yourself and see what the hype is about?

[The Fall of Troy - Mouths Like Sidewinder Missiles](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1323739#osu) by [RyuK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6304246)\
159 BPM, 3:43 | 7.91★\
*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

*Mouths Like Sidewinder Missiles* sits at a high 7\* difficulty with variable BPM, yet usually sitting around \~250 BPM.

Made up of square jumps, flowy aim, and some other awkward patterning, the map stays relatively simple and abides by those patterns throughout, with few bursts and only one notable stream. Though keeping things simple, RyuK made this math rock bop into a tricky and enjoyable challenge. I hope you have fun playing.

*description written by [Wixonater](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084)*

*I Am S​/​H​(​im​)​e​\[​r\]* is a high difficulty map sitting at 8\* with variable BPM changes and patterning, comprised of 3 difficulties, or "Chapters", and a Marathon difficulty to bind them all together.

Chapter 1 starts strong with high spacing 1/2 alt patterns and occasional 1/3 bursts and streams, leading into a more tranquil Chapter 2, with much calmer 1/2 alt patterns and sliders ending with the capstone of slider art. Filled with highly spaced 1/3 streams, 1/2 alt patterns, and slider jumps, Chapter 3 concludes the whole show. I hope you enjoy this instrumental math-rock experience.

[Hashimoto Jin - STAND PROUD (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/166137#osu) by [Atsuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2279351)\
165 BPM, 1:27 | 1.63★, 2.34★, 3.62★, 4.83★\
*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

One for old map fans and JoJo fans alike, *STAND PROUD* is a great example of the symmetry style of mapping favoured back in the era this was created. Atsuro's map does a brilliant job of providing a lower-intensity enjoyable ride through the song, and is as aesthetic as it is top fun to play. Rocking up with almost 600 favourites, it seems I'm not the only one to feel this. A full difficulty spread is available too, so you don't have to jump straight in at 5\* if that's not your speed. Give it a try — the set is worth the time!

*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

A rhythm game classic here in DJ Sharpnel's *BLUE ARMY*, staying consistent with the style of chart seen in other games, SnowNiNo\_ presents us with a great test of a map. It throws 1/4 note pattern after 1/4 note pattern at the player, combining generic streams, cutstreams and everything in between into one gigantic test of your 182 BPM tapping and aim stamina. With a maximum combo of 3582, come test your mettle against 6 minutes of 6\* stream mapping; just don't blame us if your tapping hand is exhausted afterwards.

*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

Another Nattu belter hits the Loved shelves this week — *You are the Miserable (Laur Remix)* splices together the melodic brilliance of t+pazolite with the psytrance style of Laur, meaning a brilliant test of your overall skill throughout this map. Typical psytrance streams and jumps fly at you constantly over the five-minute runtime, but mixed in are some intricate rhythms you may trip up on, so keep your wits about you as you give this one a go!

*description written by [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050)*

If you've hung around in a top player's stream before, chances are you'll have seen this map at one stage or another. Submitted in late 2016, this is one of Akali's most challenging maps still to this date. The bulk of the map contains 146 BPM large spacing technical patterns that sometimes turn into jumps and are interspersed with bursts at 292 BPM. Hence, the mechanical difficulty of this map is definitely not to be messed with, especially when it doesn't give you any downtime over its almost 7-minute length. Think you're up to the challenge?

The \[NSV\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [-Kazu-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)*

It's really been a while since the last time we had a pick that was appealing to the mid-level Oni player and we're glad to bring *Wakaranai* to the Loved votes! As a very fun stream-centered map that uses SV changes as a little treat while focusing on delivering very easy-to-execute streams, it makes mod usage really fun here, especially with Hidden due to its SV being quite comfortable to read, and Hard Rock, as managing to set a score with that mod would look really impressive to anyone taking a glance. Have fun!

[Katagiri - kedamono_friends (Extended ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/920744#taiko) by [rezi888](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2337821)\
240 BPM, 4:14 | 6.80★\
*description written by [X a v y](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3738344)*

At 240 BPM, *kedamono_friends* is quite an upbeat and enjoyable piece of work, featuring a variety of comfortable patterns tossed in with a lot of short 1/6 bursts. The map maintains the same intensity for 4 minutes, which makes it quite difficult yet helpful for advanced players who want to practice hitting short bursts.

*description written by [X a v y](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3738344)*

This is the latest edition to Shamirin_mzk's "Mono." series, which was received surprisingly well from the playerbase. In the series, Shamirin_mzk uses his special craft to make creative barline gimmicks that fit very well with the artist's music. Moreover, this map uses a gimmick that has not been seen before in this series and makes sure that every single moment feels engaging and never fails to show off its aesthetics.

The \[voztr's Overdose\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [Wesley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2407265)*

\[224\]Reol is making a return to the Loved category once again, this time with *Lost One no Goukoku*. The map is relatively straightforward — an excellent Overdose difficulty with various patterns going from regular jumps to more snappy jumps and a few small wiggles.

While the map is of a relatively low star rating given the snappiness of the sliders, it could still pose a challenge for some players to get 100% accuracy on it.

The Dan series hosted by Emiru is back, now with the higher levels! Each difficulty consists of 4 different skill-based maps: jump, technical, speed, and boss map, respectively. If you want a challenge but the previous Dan was too easy, this is an excellent chance to test yourself for sure!

190 BPM, 5:52 | 6.53★, 6.53★\
*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

Here we go again with another Badis map for the Loved section. If you know their mapping style, then you are aware that it is really difficult and unique because they use a lot of uncommon patterns that are tricky to play.

This map is mostly streams, but it is not your average stream map where you just hold dash for 5 minutes. It has a lot of unconventional stream patterns and shapes with very tight jumps in between which make it hard to achieve a decent combo. It is very reading-heavy, so definitely a good map to challenge your reading skills on.

The original AR of the map is 9.3 but the set also comes with an AR 9.6 difficulty for people who are more comfortable with a higher AR. Make sure to check it out!

Sometimes, and I mean *sometimes*, you want something that is calm, not too straining, chill, you name it. Well, here you go! In this unusual not so "pro" level collab of two ex-pro players, one can really take time to enjoy themselves for a while. Having only a Salad, Platter, and Rain difficulty makes this map playable for any player, whether you have thousands of hours of experience or only one. Soooo... Take it easy, vibe a little to *Souzou Forest*, and have a good one!

A beautiful song written by sasakure.UK within the beatmania community, only to be presented and charted by Valedict, a prominent mapper for the osu!mania community.

This chart delivers unique structures and layerings such as 165 BPM streams being at its focal point, with powerful transitions and side melodies such as 1/3 double jacks, 1/8 streams, constantly switching between fast-paced and slower buildups. Paired along the addictive melody and chorus this song entrances us by, it would also be a perfect tournament chart testing a player's ability to remain calm with a unique tech-ratio and polyrhythmic patterns.

This is yet another amazing chart to be added to Valedict's collection of Loved charts, so please give your vote for this fantastic and well-constructed map!

Here it is! The most infamous SV map, demanded by many, the one and only, *polyriddim* by HowToPlayLN enters the Loved voting! Most of you probably already know what this map is about, but I'll say it anyway: DO NOT try to sightread this. This map is all about extreme memorization and requires a lot of effort to get even a remotely good score.

Crazy bumps, teleports, and straight up invisible notes make it seem unplayable. However, clever usage of repeated patterning allows you to slowly build up the muscle memory and work your way through the chart. If that isn't enough, extreme rhythm quantizations make it incredibly hard to even begin the correct rhythms, let alone follow with proper patterns. To top it off, *polyriddim* features very cool visual effects that further spice up the chart while also providing very interesting eye candy.

Being able to S rank this monstrosity is already a huge feat, so good luck to all challengers! But don't forget to vote for *polyriddim* in the voting first!

*Yoru ni Kakeru* is here, along with the first beatmap from 11Bit! To talk a bit about 11Bit, for starters, they have garnered a vast amount of prominence over this past year among the eastern mapping scene, and for good reason. They're a hardworking member of the osu!mania community creating nearly 100 maps in just a year and a half, and all of them feel unique. It wasn't exactly a clear decision what map of theirs should go up first — hence, we decided to go with their most popular.

*Yoru ni Kakeru* is a pretty straightforward dump map with patterning that should feel comfortable to anyone who is familiar with this style of mapping. 11Bit makes consistent use of 1/6 streams and 1/8 bursts throughout the heavier parts of the map, along with a steady use of hands and jack transitioning in and out of patterns. They've also provided up to 1.4 for rates to any players looking for a challenge.

Let's all give 11Bit a warm welcome for their first Loved submission!

MyZterioN- makes their first appearance to the Loved section with their chart of Camellia's heart-pumping remix of *MEGALOVANIA*. I'm sure everyone is familiar with this song and specifically the remix, but we'll be happy to talk about it to anyone unaware of this map.

Lasting 6 minutes, this gauntlet of a beatmap constantly tests your abilities as a player, whether it be with ridiculously fast jumpstreams, reading through the hybrid-oriented sections, or the ending bursts that peak at nearly 500 BPM. All things considered though, MyZterioN- has done a good job of not making the map feel overlayered, and they made sure to give players a number of breaks where it made the most sense.

Give MyZterioN- your support by casting your vote!

Imperial Wolf's collaborative 6K endurance pack is here! This pack contains beatmaps from \_IceRain, Aliplay, Arkman, \[Crz\]sunnyxxy, tyrcs, Anson_98, and of course, Imperial Wolf.

As the title suggests, this pack is targeted towards more experienced 6K players since all of the maps here emphasize the "endurance" factor. Whether it's the relentless high BPM chordstreams of *Immortal saga* and *GuNGNiR*, or the maps that focus patterns on reading and coordination like *Eighth-slave* and *Dst\[ick\]orv*, what's here will give even some of the most experienced mania players a good challenge.

The people who provided beatmaps to this set are well-known within the 6K mapping scene and the mapping community in general, and we're thankful that Imperial Wolf put this together as it's a pretty cohesive rice-biased pack with a good difficulty spread. Make sure to check out all of the mappers who've helped put this together, and make sure to send your vote!

*Future Cider* is a mapset that has been there for quite a long time, and it has even been showcased in the Finals Mappool of [osu!mania 7K World Cup 2018](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2018_7K). Since then it has certainly become a crowd favourite, gaining significant traction.

A very accessible mapset with a multitude of difficulties, the main selling point of *Future Cider* is its energetic nature expressed in a clean and fun manner. Lower difficulties are a great introduction to light chordstreaming with additional bursts and some simple long notes. As the difficulty progresses, more and more complex patterns appear, accompanied with streamy LNs with increasing density.

The top 3 difficulties, including Jakads' and Bpple's collab Blue Another and two iterations of Future Candy feature a whole new level of challenge with stutter and bump SVs that are present during virtually the whole chart. Futuristic Candy is the top difficulty, and it builds on Future Candy with LN choruses being even more difficult. Even though the harder charts deliver lots of diverse patterns to process, they aren't overdone and greatly emphasize the song.

This set has waited way too long in the darkness and we're glad to finally bring one of the most popular 7K sets to the Loved voting.

Cuppp and gemboyong are here to bring their notorious maps of *Penguin* to Loved. Neither mapper should need much of an introduction as both Cuppp and gemboyong have had entries in Loved for a long time now, but I'll at least provide a bit of history to these two maps for any who are unaware, starting with Cuppp's 7K diff.

This map is already near 6 years old but still a hilarious demonstration of just how far you can take the O2Jam-styled patterning for a song like this. The intro to the chart is pretty tame, but once it's over, you're quickly thrown into what I can only describe as "LN Art". Full LN double stairs moving from left to right, uncomfortable anchored LN holds and gaps, and on top of that, almost all of this is charted to 1/8. For the map being just over a minute thirty, Cuppp managed to pack in more pain and suffering than you'll see in most maps of this vein more than triple its length.

Now onto gemboyong's 4K difficulty, they used Cuppp's map as the blueprint and manually converted any of the patterns that could comfortably fit with the lesser note count to 4K. Many 4K players should be aware of this diff specifically since it's featured in their popular [Gems pack 13](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/555819) that was uploaded in 2017.

Anyways, I'm glad we were able to get gemboyong's difficulty included, and the Loved team is happy to finally bring you these masterpieces. LET'S GO!

The \[Davvy's Dreaming Descent\] difficulty is *not* being nominated for Loved.\
*description written by [\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750)*

\_underjoy's 4K difficulty of *I Am S/H(im)e\[r\]* is a solid technical hybrid map with difficulty predominantly located in the beginning and ending of the song. The marathon starts with a high-speed jumpstream section, which is repeated throughout the chart. Then, long note parts with tricky releases and some more some irregular rhythms are introduced, posing a significant accuracy challenge.

The intensity is abruptly stopped and the player can rest while fully immersing themselves in the calm nature of the song. Long notes and chords are patterned in a very recurrent manner that emphasizes constant repetition and overall theme of the chart. A long break introduces the player to the last part, which is a slightly modified version of the first one.

This map takes the player up for a steep yet rewarding journey through the depths of the unknown, and indeed is an interesting addition to the Loved roster!
