### Winner

Proving their competence with back to back wins in May and June, [kuyusu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11758667) impressed judges with their submission of [*REDOUT feat. Torika*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1531377)! Pairing unconventional square-like slidershapes with object groupings that make for the perfectly fit the square pattern theme, kuyusu's design choices are something you undoubtedly need to experience first-hand.

Judges weren't the only ones impressed though — **10** of the 12 screeners put this entry in their top 5, just barely scraping by as the highest voted entry this month.

### Runner-up

[ScubDomino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308) put full investment into this contest's theme with their entry of [*Tanchiky vs. Hagane - Legacy 8086*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1531148). Sporting patterns so square-centric that it's hard to even define them as rankable, this entry is a treat for anyone looking for something out of the box.
