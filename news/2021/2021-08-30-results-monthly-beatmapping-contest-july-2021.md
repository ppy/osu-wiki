The **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) is... well, a beatmap contest that's held monthly. The [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) has all the details, so check that if you're out of the loop.

## Summary

| User | Placement | Badge prize | Title prize | [MBC Points](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) |

Both of these mappers were on the cusp of earning the highest prize in the MBC, and now they've finally been rewarded for their efforts! Details on their entries and the rest of the contestants can be found below.

## osu! finalists

This month's contest took a different approach from our previous contests. Mappers were required to create **2** maps, so our [screeners](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) evaluated both maps together, resulting in the **top 6** maps from **44 entries**.

[Judges](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) were tasked with evaluating those 6 entries (12 maps) separately in all categories *except for theme*, since this contest's theme was focused on the contrast of the two maps. Words are probably making this extra confusing, so explore the results for yourself:

| Rank | Beatmap | Musical representation (80+80) | Creativity (80+80) | Gameplay (80+80) | Theme (160) | Total |

### Winner

Dominating for the last 3 months in a row, [kuyusu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11758667) has taken the well-deserved throne with their submissions of [*Tanchiky - Revolution* & *fiend - 2DF2*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1563859). Their approach aimed for a clear contrast that anyone could pick up on: one of their maps used only sliders, while the other used only circles.

Given its landslide scores above other entrants and receiving the #1 spot among screeners, nobody can question kuyusu's authority in mapping as osu!'s newest *Elite Mapper*!

### Runner-up

[Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) has been on the grind for a *long* time in our Monthly Beatmapping Contests.

He's achieved a win in [March 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-04-21-monthly-beatmapping-contest-3-results), and another win + the screeners' #1 pick in [June 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-07-24-monthly-beatmapping-contest-5-6-results). With countless spots among finalists in contests thereafter, he hasn't picked up a win until more than a year later!

That said, Sylas has joined osu!'s prestigous *Elite Mapper* list with his beatmaps of [*Tanchiky - Revolution* & *fiend - 2DF2*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1563787)!
