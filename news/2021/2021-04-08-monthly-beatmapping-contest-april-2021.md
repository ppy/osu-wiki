Compete with other mappers to find out who holds the crown in this slidershape-themed mapping contest!

This month's [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) includes opportunities for **osu!**, **osu!taiko**, and **osu!catch** mappers. If you're an osu!mania mapper, next month is your time to shine.

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (2.5 weeks):** Contests are announced at the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- [**Screening (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Judging (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Rewards:**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including fancy profile badges and the legendary *Elite Mapper* title!

Because this process takes about 6 weeks, results will be announced halfway through next month. That said, March's contest is about to enter the judging phase. Look forward to its outcome soon!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

To ensure each MBC is a brand new experience, they all feature a **limitation** — a mapping restriction that all submissions must follow, like *no slider velocity changes* or *circles cannot be used*.

**[osu! MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/122) limitations:**

- All sliders must use red anchors.
- Red anchors must form clear corners in the slidershape.

This idea leaves room for interpretation, so here are a few examples of acceptable sliders. Note how each of their red anchors creates a distinct bump in the slidershape:

And here's a few examples of what is *NOT* allowed. They either have no red anchors, or their red anchors don't create corners in the slidershape:

Because of the obvious potential for loopholes with this limitation, we'll give more weight to the "limitation" category in this month's judging (similar to the [overlap-themed MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-09-08-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september) from a few months ago).

**[osu!taiko MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/123) limitation:**

- No more than 3 of the same note colours in a row.

**[osu!catch MBC](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/124) limitation:**

- Sliders cannot be used.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is the vocal-chopping expert [**MYUKKE.**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/121). These three songs are available for mapping in the osu!, osu!taiko, and osu!catch contests:

#### Boudica (165 BPM)

## Rules

You might have limitless mapping ideas, but you'll still need to fit within the bounds of the contest to participate. Each submission must:

- **follow the month's [beatmapping limitation](#limitation) for the contest's mode:**
    - **osu!:**
        - All sliders must use red anchors.
        - Red anchors must form clear corners in the slidershape.
    - **osu!taiko:**
        - No more than 3 of the same note colours in a row.
    - **osu!catch:**
        - Sliders cannot be used.
- **be in `.osz` format.** Including a background image and custom hitsounds is fine, but storyboard/video content will not be considered.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.

## Submission

All contests are accepting entries for a bit over **2 weeks!** Head to any of the contest listings below to submit your entry before April 26th.
