Remember how your earliest mapping days were spent creating an endless supply of messy blankets? It's time to put that skill to the test through this month's mapping contest!

August's [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is for **osu!** only. View the contest listing [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/134)!

## Schedule

- **Beatmapping (2.5 weeks):** Contests are announced near the start of the month and beatmappers create their entries.
- [**Screening (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#screening) Competitive entries are selected by experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Judging (1.5 weeks):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#judging) Competitive entries are judged by different experienced beatmappers for each mode.
- [**Rewards (announced in September):**](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) Winners are announced and prizes are redeemed, including fancy profile badges and the legendary *Elite Mapper* title!

## Beatmapping

### Theme

The MBC stays fresh by enforcing a *theme* each month! These are loose mapping ideas like "square patterns" or "overlapping objects" that submissions focus on in different contests.

This month's contest is all about **blankets**.

Surely every new mapper knows what a blanket is, but in case you've been mapping in an isolation chamber, blankets are objects wrapping around other objects. For example:

While this image shows a *conventional* blanket, there's tons of *unconventional* ways to implement blankets too. Blankets don't need to look perfect — they only need to express some sort of symmetrical object wrapping.

We're sure you can come up with engaging ways to handle a blanket-themed map, so we'll leave it in your hands. Best of luck and stay cozy.

### Songs

Each MBC provides beatmappers a choice between songs from one of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).

This month's artist is our recent artist addition [**Reku Mochizuki**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/163). Pick from any of these musical marvels:

#### FORViDDEN ENERZY -Fataldoze- (1:40 / 185 BPM)

## Rules

Time for the nitty gritty. Submissions must...

- **follow the month's [beatmapping theme](#theme): *blankets***
- **be in `.osz` format.** Including a background image and custom hitsounds is fine, but skin/storyboard/video content will not be considered.
- **be a single difficulty for one of the month's [selected songs](#songs).**
- **not be uploaded to the osu! website through the Beatmap Submission System (*BSS*).** All contest submissions are anonymous during the screening/judging phases to avoid bias. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR ENTRY!**
- **be solely created by you.** Collaborations are not allowed.
- **abide by the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** While we can be forgiving for mistakes, submissions that could not be ranked without major changes will be disqualified.

## Submission

You've got **until the end of the month** to produce your avant-garde blanket sensation (a.k.a. your beatmap). When you're ready, visit the [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/134) to submit!

Aaaaaaaand that's all for now! Look forward to the results for last month's contest soon, along with results for the on-going contests from every other mode!
