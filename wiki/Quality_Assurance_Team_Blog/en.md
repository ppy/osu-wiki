# Quality Assurance Team Blog

The **[Quality Assurance Team Blog](http://osuqat.tumblr.com)**, commonly referred to as the *QAT Blog*, was a semi-regular blog written by members of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/Glossary#quality-assurance-team). Beginning in August of 2016, they discussed not only the activities of the QAT, but a variety of other topics spanning osu! gameplay, mapping, modding and the game/community as a whole.

In September of 2017, the *QAT Gazette* series began using [osu!news](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news) as a platform, rather than the QAT Blog.
