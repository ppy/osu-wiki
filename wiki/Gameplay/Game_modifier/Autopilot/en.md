## Description

*Notice: Enabling the Autopilot mod will cause the play to be unranked and will not be saved to the local leaderboards.*

The **Autopilot** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier) for the [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) game mode that will take control of the cursor movement and systematically move to the exact centre of the next [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object), leaving the tapping to the player. During a play with the Autopilot mod enabled, the player will not be able to move their cursor, unless they are on the pause screen.

The Autopilot mod also disables the in-game interface, thus hiding the [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score), [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo), and misses, although this can be re-enabled by pressing `Shift` + `Tab`.

Additionally, the spins per minute (SPM) value performed by the Autopilot mod is similar to the spins per minute performed by the [Spun Out](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Spun_Out) mod, thus the player cannot increase the SPM by spinning the spinner with their cursor.
