The **Fade In** mod makes notes initially invisible as they enter from above, gradually revealing them as they approach the bottom of the playfield. The fade effect initially covers about 20% of the playfield, but expands as the combo increases. At 500x combo, the fade effect reaches its maximum, covering 70% of the playfield and making notes appear much later.

**This mod can't be customised through Customisation.**
