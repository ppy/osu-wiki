## Description

*Notice: Enabling Target Practice will result in an unranked play.*

The **Target Practice** mod is an experimental [game modifier](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier) for [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!), which removes all the mapped [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) and replaces them with a simplified set of "targets". It is used mostly for fun, but can also be helpful for practising a consistent tempo and improving hit accuracy.

When Target Practice is activated, osu! hides the health bar and accuracy meter. The player has to hit the targets gradually appearing across the [playfield](/wiki/Client/Playfield), with the intention of hitting their centres. To maintain stable rhythm, players can follow the metronome playing in the background.

The game continues until the first [MISS](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/osu!), which takes the player to the [results screen](/wiki/Client/Interface#results-screen). The meaning of different grades is similar to that in [osu!mania](/wiki/Gameplay/Grade#osu!mania).

## Targets

A target can be considered a special type of [hit circle](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle) without a [combo number](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo). Hit score and accuracy depend on the hit position and timing: the more accurate and precise these are, the more points are given, with an ideal hit being worth 250 points. At the playfield, targets are placed in groups, with a new group starting every two [full beats](/wiki/Music_theory/Beat). The spacing within a group remains constant and increases slightly with every new group.

## Trivia

- The Target Practice Mod uses [combo colours](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo_colour) from the [skin.ini](/wiki/Skinning/skin.ini) of the active skin.
- Failing a play with Target Practice takes the player to the results screen instead of the fail screen.
