# Accuracy

<!-- TODO: needs to be combined with /wiki/Accuracy in some way -->

**Accuracy** defines how accurately a player is hitting [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). This value varies from 0 to 100%. Accuracy can be seen in the top-right corner while watching a replay or playing a beatmap.
