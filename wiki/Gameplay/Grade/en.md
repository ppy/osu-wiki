# Grade

*For other uses, see [Rank (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Rank).*

**Grades** are a set of letters representing a player's performance on a given [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). They accompany the total [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) on the result screen and appear in all lists alongside scores.

From lowest to highest, the possible grades are D, C, B, A, S, and SS. Silver S and SS grades are only achievable when using the [Hidden](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hidden), [Flashlight](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Flashlight), or [Fade In](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Fade_In) game modifiers.
