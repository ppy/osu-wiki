# Hit circle

*Hit circle* are a type of colored, circular [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) present in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). They are core gameplay elements, requiring players to click on/tap them in time with the music to [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) point. The more [accurate](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) is the player the more points he scores, and it provides a very small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Gameplay/Health) as well as a larger boost at the end of a [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo).


### Customization and skinning

Hit circles are customizable through osu! [skins](/wiki/Skin/), allowing player to modify their appearance. 

### In osu!

In osu!, hit circles are numbered to indicate their order in a combo. Each hit circle is surrounded by an [approach circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Approach_circle), which shrink around it. Once the approach circle overlaps the hit circle, the player must click on/tap the hit cirlce to earn score. Missing this timing results in a lower score based on the timing gap, interrupt the combo and reduces the player's health.

### In osu!taiko

In osu!taiko, hit circles appear from right-to-left as either red or blue notes (Don or Katu). As hit circles approach and line up with the white [judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement) circle the correct key(s) must be pressed to gain score.
