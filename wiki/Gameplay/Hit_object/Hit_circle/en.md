# Hit circle

*Hit circles* are a type of coloured, circular [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) present in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). They are core gameplay elements, requiring players to click on/tap them in time with the music to [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) points. Clicking hit circles more [accurately](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) awards more score, as well as providing a very small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Gameplay/Health) and a larger one at the end of a [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo).

## Customisation and skinning

Hit circles are customisable through [skins](/wiki/Skin), allowing players to modify their appearance. 

Hit circles are numbered to indicate their order in a combo. Each hit circle is surrounded by an [approach circle](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Approach_circle) that shrinks around it. Once the approach circle overlaps the hit circle, the player must click or tap the hit circle to earn score. Missing this timing results in a lower score based on how far off the hit was, potentially breaking the combo and reducing the player's health.
