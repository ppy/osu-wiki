# Repeat slider

A *repeat slider* is a [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!), which acts exactly like a [slider](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider) with the added benefit of reversing itself on completion. This is indicated in gameplay with a reverse arrow where the slidertail would otherwise be. Sliders can be reversed by clicking and dragging the slidertail in the timeline of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor). This can be done multiple times to the same slider to create a slider with multiple reverses.
