# Don & Kat

*Not to be confused with: [Katu judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Katu)*

**Don & Kat** are circles coloured in red and blue respectively which are present in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). **Finishers** (sometimes called *strong hits*) are a bigger version of the regular dons and kats that require the player to press two buttons of proper colour, instead of just one.

Players are required to click/tap the circles in time when they are positioned in the white judgement circle on the left side. The more accurate a click is to the beat, the more [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) will be rewarded, and the player may receive a small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Gameplay/Health). Hitting Finisher notes perfectly will give double the score compared to regular circles and award a `BONUS` judgement. A miss will occur if the player fails to hit the proper colour in a timely manner. Hitting the wrong colour, or both red and blue at the same time, will also be considered a miss.
