# Don & Kat

*Not to be confused with: [Katu judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Katu)*

![](img/taiko-hits.png "Regular and Finisher notes in osu!taiko")

The **Dons & Kats** notes are circular [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) present in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) that are coloured in red and blue respectively. They move from right to left on the conveyer belt towards the stationary **judgement circle** on the left side.

When the Dons & Kats overlap with this white circle, the player is required to strike the corresponding part of the drum to earn points:

| Note | Colour | Drum input | Sound |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Don | Red | Strike the drum's **center**. | A deep, resonant "don" sound. |
| Kat | Blue | Strike the drum's **rim**. | A sharp, high-pitched "kat" sound. |

## Finishers

**Finishers** (sometimes called *strong hits*) are bigger versions of the regular Dons and Kats where the player must press two buttons simultaneously of proper colour, instead of just one. Besides that, Finisher notes work the same as regular notes.

## Judgement

Upon hitting a note, the game awards a [judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement) based on how accurate the timing is, and the player may receive a small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Gameplay/Health). Hitting Finisher notes perfectly will give double the score compared to regular notes, and award a `BONUS` judgement.

A miss will occur if the player fails to hit the proper colour in a timely manner. Hitting the wrong colour, or both red and blue at the same time, will also be considered a miss.

A series of consecutive successful hits builds a [combo](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_(score_multiplier)), which multiplies the base score of subsequent notes.
