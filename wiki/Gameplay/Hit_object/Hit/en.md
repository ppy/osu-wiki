# Hit

*Not to be confused with: [Katu judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Katu)*

**Hits** are coloured circles present in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) which are called **Don** for the red variant and **Katsu** or **Katu** for the blue variant, respectively. **Finisher** are a bigger version of the regular hits which require the player to press two buttons of proper colour, instead of just one.

Players are required to click/tap hits in time when they are positioned in the white judgement circle on the left side. The more accurate a click is to the beat, the more [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) will be rewarded, and the player may receive a small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Gameplay/Health). Hitting Finisher notes perfectly will give double the score compared to regular hits and award a `BONUS` judgement. A miss will occur if the player fails to hit the proper colour in a timely manner. Hitting the wrong colour, or both red and blue at the same time, will also be considered a miss.
