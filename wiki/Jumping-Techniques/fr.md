A jump is an advanced [mapping technique](Mapping_techniques "wikilink") where the mapper places two [hit objects](hit_object "wikilink") farther apart than the standard [distance snap](Distance_Snap "wikilink") multiplier would allow. This is usually done by either temporarily changing the distance snap multiplier or temporarily turning off distance snap.

Jumps are typically used to represent increased emphasis in the music. However, they are also often used for feel. They can also be used to separate [combos](combos "wikilink") from each other and to avoid clutter in one particular area of the [beatmap](beatmap "wikilink").

Jumps are typically used in [Hard](Hard "wikilink") and [Insane](Insane "wikilink") [difficulties](Song_Setup#Difficulty "wikilink"). They are also occasionally used in [Easy](Easy_(Difficulty) "wikilink") and [Normal](Normal "wikilink") difficulties, but in those cases the jumps are typically small and typically have a good amount of time between each hit object, giving time for the [player](players "wikilink") to react.

Misuse of Jumps
---------------

A common mistake of newer [mappers](mappers "wikilink") is that they see jumps being used in other mappers' [Insane difficulties](Insane "wikilink"), and they then go and throw jumps in their map without knowing how to properly use them, often creating a mess. If you want to use a jump, simply ask yourself one simple question:

"Is there anything in the music or rhythm that suggests a jump here?"

It's recommended to stay away from "feel" jumps until you have more experience mapping and understand when to use those properly. Yes, an experienced mapper using "feel" jumps can make a map that's absolutely brilliant. For your first map, however, it's often a good idea to keep it simple and work from there.
