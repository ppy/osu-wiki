_See also: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)._

Ranking Criteria is a set of rules and guidelines set by the QAT to ensure that every player can expect similar game play throughout every beatmap.

## Beatmapping

_See also: [Beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping/#getting-started)._

Beatmapping is the process of a creator creating a beatmap. This process includes: selecting music, timing and mapping the beatmap, and testing the beatmap. It might also include: adding a video, adding a [storyboard](/wiki/storyboarding/#getting-started), and/or adding a [custom skin](/wiki/skinning/#getting-started). All of those can be done by the creator alone or with other users, sometimes referred to as _storyboarders_, _skinners_, and/or _guest creators_, depending on what they do.

## Modding

_See also: [Modding](/wiki/Modding/#getting-started)._

Modding is the process of users reviewing (or commonly called "modding") a creator's beatmap in the pending (or work in progress/help) stage. Modding plays a big role in quality control because this allows creators to fix issues with their beatmap.
