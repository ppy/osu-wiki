- Each submission must be accompanied by a forum thread in order to participate in the contest.
- Submissions must be made in time. Latecomers will not be accepted.

- Submissions must be created individually. Teams/collaborations are not allowed.
- The file size for your `.osk` submission must be below 100 MB.
