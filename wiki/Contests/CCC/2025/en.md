### Contest rules

- **This contest is for the osu!mania mode only.**
- **This contest is for Chinese players only, including players with the flags of ::{ flag=CN }:: the Chinese mainland, ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong, ::{ flag=MO }:: Macao, and ::{ flag=TW }:: Taiwan eligible for participation.**
- **Your account must be valid, and be used for logging into [Mappers' Guild](https://mappersguild.com).**
- **Submissions must be in the `.osz` format.**
- **The osu! client must be able to correctly import and read your submission.**
- **Submission must be `4K`, `5K`, `6K`, or `7K`.** Other key modes are not considered in this contest (including the n+1 playstyle).
- **Beatmaps should be based on the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/osu!mania).** There is no requirement to abide by the ranking criteria, but beatmaps need to use it as a fundamental reference, or that will effect your final score.
- **Videos, skins, storyboards and hitsounds are NOT allowed.**
- **Title, Artist, MP3, Source, Tags, Background, and Preview Point must NOT be modified.**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submitting entries means understanding and agreeing to the above rules.**

### Judging criteria

- **Musical Representation (30 points):** How the beatmap expresses the song through overall layering, patterning and structure, and how it appropriately interprets the song by use of instruments, melodies, sounds, rhythms, etc.
- **Creativity (30 points):** How innovative the beatmap's design is: unique structural arrangement, logical changes, and technique presentation.
- **Playability (30 points):** How the beatmap feels to the players from the visual and gameplay standpoint, and how it maintains a reasonable difficulty curve.
- **Judges' Impression (10 points):** This is the part of the score left to the judges' personal preferences on the submission, or the factors that didn't relate to the three aspects above.

The judge scores will be normalized using the formula from the Mappers' Guild: *judge X's final score = (judge X's raw score - judge X's average raw score) / judge X's standard deviation*

Submissions are anonymous to judges.
