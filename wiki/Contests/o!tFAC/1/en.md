## Ruleset

### Contest rules

- **Contestants will submit ONE difficulty of any licensed song they choose from the [Featured Artist library](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).**
- **Your map must be an osu!taiko map.**
- **All submissions must be rankable.** No beatmap submitted must be intentionally unrankable. Mistakes happen and points will be deducted for them, but this is a regular mapping contest, not aspire. (You're allowed to ignore spread rules for the sake of this contest.)
- **Maps must NOT be uploaded/shared with others before judging and results are announced.** Sharing your entry publicly by any means before the results are announced will get your entry disqualified, no questions asked.
- **Submissions will not be accepted after the deadlines.** No exceptions.

### Judging criteria

- **Judge's Impression (5 Points):** Points will be assigned based on what the judge thinks about your map.
- **Ranking Criteria (5 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map abides by the Ranking Criteria.
- **Structure (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map is internally designed (consistency, concept introduction, etc.).
- **Relevance (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map represents the song and how well it plays.
- **Creativity (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how the submission uses creative and fitting elements to make itself stand out.
