# Vocaloid Mapping Contest 3

![VMC banner](img/banner.jpg)

The **Vocaloid Mapping Contest** (***VMC***) is a beatmapping contest hosted by the Vocaloid Appreciation Team (VAT). Its purpose is to *promote VOCALOID, UTAU, and other vocal synth music*, giving both popular and overlooked songs a chance to shine.

Participants compete to create the *best beatmap possible*, with their entries judged by some of the most talented and respected VOCALOID-focused mappers in the osu! community.

The third iteration of the contest introduces a *multi-phase format* featuring the **PARALLEL**, **SWAP**, and **DUET** rounds. This year also celebrates multiple Featured Artists whose songs were specifically chosen for the competition, along with continued support for every game mode.

## Ruleset

- **Submissions must use songs from [**MARETU**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/504) and [**mimizu**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/505).** Cut versions are not allowed.
- **Teams must submit a team roster anytime prior to submitting Round 1 entries.** Only teams of two are allowed to participate. Mappers may not participate solo. Teams may not be changed after roster submissions.
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Beatmaps must follow the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).** Minor mistakes (like an off-screen object) can be forgiven, but intentional unrankable elements will result in disqualification.
- **Maps must remain anonymous** until after the results are announced. Metadata will be anonymized before judging.
- **No storyboards or videos** are to be included in submissions.
- **No manual `.osu` file edits** beyond what is possible in the editor.
- **Each `.osz` submission must include all required difficulties and songs for that round.** Be sure to follow the instructions on the submission page to avoid issues!
- **Collaborative difficulties should feature approximately equal contribution between both mappers.**
- **All aspects of each submission must be created solely be a member of the team.** As such, artificial intelligence (AI) is not permitted.

## Registration

- To participate, a team of two (2) mappers must be formed. There is no restriction on who you can have on your team, with limited exceptions:
  - No mappers may be restricted or contest/tournament banned.
  - Mappers cannot participate on more than one team.
  - Mappers may not be a judge, screener, or other staff for the contest.
- One member of the team will need to be the captain. This should be decided prior to signing up.
- One member of each team, at minimum, is required to join the [VAT Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/EruvDHaReY) in order to receive important contest updates.
- [**Register here**](https://form-auth.ppy.sh/form/vmc3-signups).

## Judging

The judging process is split between **Phase 1 (PARALLEL & SWAP Rounds)** and **Phase 2 (DUET Round)**. Each phase includes its own unique primary category, while all other criteria apply equally to both.

In Phase 1, each map for Song A is scored individually in Relevance, Creativity, Expertise, and Overall Impression. The scores in each criteria are added. Then, these two maps are put side to side a 'Uniqueness' score is added. This is worth 25% of the raw score. This process repeats for Song B. Song B's averaged criteria scores are then averaged with Song A's, which are then standardized to determine the final placements.

| Criterion | Points | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **Phase 1 – Uniqueness** | **100** | How distinctive and innovative is the entry? Does it showcase fresh ideas that set it apart from typical mapping trends while feeling cohesive and enjoyable? |
| **Phase 2 – Cohesion** | **100** | How naturally do the swapped maps work as a single, unified entry? The final product should feel seamless and consistent despite being made by different team members. |
| **Relevance** | 100 | How well does the map fit the song? Are the gameplay elements fundamentally tied to the music? |
| **Creativity** | 60 | How bold and exciting are the mapper's ideas compared to current mapping trends? Does the map evoke reactions like "wow!" or "that's super interesting"? |
| **Expertise** | 60 | Technical skill, execution, and consistency of the map's design and structure. |
| **Overall Impression** | 80 | Subjective evaluation from the judging panel, factoring in personal enjoyment and interpretation. |

## Contest format

The **VMC3** consists of three unique phases: **PARALLEL**, **SWAP**, and **DUET**, each with distinct objectives and rules.

### PARALLEL round

- Teams of **two mappers** must be formed before submitting for this round.
- One mapper will select and map a song from **MARETU**, while the other will select and map a song from **mimizu**.
- **Each team must submit two (2) separate maps** by the round deadline — one for each chosen song.
- After submissions close, a short screening phase will occur.
  - Teams that are eliminated will be notified via osu! private message or Discord.

Tip: form your team and start planning early to avoid last-minute rushes. Plan ahead for future rounds when selecting your teammate.

### SWAP round

- Surviving teams will now **swap songs** with their partners:
  - For example, if Mapper A mapped Song #1 in the PARALLEL Round, they will now map Song #2, which Mapper B originally mapped.
- Each team must again submit **two (2) completely new maps**, one for each swapped song.
- **The twist:** These new maps must reflect a different interpretation of the songs than in the PARALLEL Round.
  - Maps that are overly similar to their original versions will receive heavy penalties during judging.
- If you are confident your team will survive the screening phase, you may begin work on this round before results are announced.

### DUET round

*Note: Due to a judging error, the top 7 osu!taiko teams advance to this round.*

- The **top 6 teams** from the SWAP Round advance to this final phase.
- Both team members will **collaborate directly** to create a **single cohesive mapset** for a selected song.
- **Every difficulty in the submission must be created collaboratively.**

This three-phase structure challenges teams to demonstrate:

- Individual skill and creativity in the PARALLEL Round,
- Adaptability and innovation in the SWAP Round, and
- Collaborative harmony and teamwork in the DUET Round finale.
