### Judging criteria[^criteria]

| Category | Details |
| :-: | :-- |
| Expertise (40%) | Expertise refers to how well the map executes itself to reflect the elements in the music. This reflects the technical skill of a mapper. However, in the Pending Cup, judging is not modding. Although we promote maps with expertise and professionalism and care about details, judges are discouraged from being nitpicky on small mistakes or minor unrankables, and will instead score in this category while considering an overarching picture of the map. |
| Creativity (40%) | Creativity refers to how reasonably outstanding the map is compared to the current mapping meta. A generic map in the current mapping meta or copy-pasting concepts from other "famous" maps is discouraged. The Pending Cup promotes creativity, so the winners of PDC should guide the mapping meta instead of following it. |
| Judge's Impression (20%) | Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry. The base Judge's Impression score is set to 10, and judges must explicitly mention why they apply any additions or deductions to that score. |

## Notes

[^criteria]: Judges are instructed to be consistent in their judging style across each track when judging.
