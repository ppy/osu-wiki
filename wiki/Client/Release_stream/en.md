# Release stream

osu! has a few **release streams**, or game client versions, that receive updates at different rates. In order to catch potential issues early, new features and changes are put into preview versions before making their way to the stable client.

| Release stream | Notes |
| :-- | :-- |
| Stable | Current, most popular version; [feature-locked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_(software_engineering)); receives updates after Beta |
| Cutting Edge | Has some differences with stable; feature-locked |
| Tachyon | Pre-release and beta version of osu!(lazer); typically contains functionality that isn't completely done |
| [Lazer](Lazer) | Rewritten game client; most active in development with [many differences and new features](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer/Feature_comparison). |
