# Help Center

Having trouble with something? We're here to help! Check out some solutions to common issues in the sidebar to the left of your screen.

## Account

### I've paid for a supporter tag, but still haven't got it!

**Depending on what payment service you use (Paypal or Xsolla), there may be a slight delay in the processing of your payment before it reaches us.**

Usually, these issues resolve themselves within a few hours, and our systems will automatically apply your tag to your account.

If it has been over 24 hours and you still haven't got your supporter tag, please email [support@ppy.sh](mailto://support@ppy.sh) and let us know about your problem.

Make sure to include any receipts that you received during the process (paypal transaction IDs, Xsolla receipts, etc) - these help us a lot in tracking down what happened to your payment!

### What is "restricted" mode, exactly?

**A person with a restricted account is temporarily prevented from interacting with the community in any meaningful way, including chatting, participating in multiplayer, and having their scores on leaderboards.**

They may continue to set scores locally and online (though the scores will not show until the status is lifted) and play the game like normal, with the exception of multiplayer.

Restrictions are relatively rare, and are only doled out in circumstances where we believe our Community Rules or Terms of Service have been breached, or an account has been observed to be acting abnormally.

In most cases, the status will be removed automatically after 24 hours. If such time has passed and you're still restricted, you may inquire about the status of your account with the support team by emailing [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh).

If you are restricted, make sure to sort it out with support instead of just making a new account to try and avoid it! Making multiple accounts to avoid restrictions causes problems for everyone - both us, and you.

### The flag on my account profile is wrong!

**We can change this for you, but only if you are actively living in the country that you wish to change to.**

We determine your country as shown on your profile page from the area in which you first registered your account from. 

If you create an account while on holiday in the United States, your account will show as belonging to the US - you'll even appear on the country rankings for the US too.

The support team can happily change your account's country upon request, **but only if you are actively living within that country at the time.** 

To confirm this, the team will ask for proof of residency - be it the appropriate passport, drivers license for your country, or some other form of ID. This must be displayed in a picture next to your monitor with the osu! client open and logged in to your account.

We'll never display this information to anyone else, and we encourage you to blank out any personal information (that won't otherwise make it impossible for us to determine what country the document is for!) if you are concerned about your privacy.

### I've forgotten my username and password!

**Please use [the password recovery page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot) to reclaim your account automatically, provided that you still have access to the email you registered with.**

If this does not work for you (or you don't have access to your registration email), please send an email to our [support team](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) with as much information as you can think of to help us acknowledge you as the owner of your account.

Good information to include this email would be:

* The name of the email address that you registered the account on, or any other email the account has been associated with since
* Any receipts for purchased osu!supporter tags or other items from the osu!store
* The last date you can remember being able to access your account normally
* Any other identifying information that you think could be helpful (excluding scores or replays, those don't help us very much!)

### My account has been banned/disabled/permanently restricted!

**Accounts are generally only disabled when they are confirmed to be multiple accounts belonging to the same user.**

If this is the case for you, as in, the account that you have had banned was not the first one you ever made, then you can usually safely log in to your first registered account without problem. Generally speaking, disabled accounts are not reactivated a vast majority of the time.

If your account has been restricted, you'll likely know why after a brief conversation with the support team. 

In situations where we are absolutely assured that foul play or wrongdoing has taken place, we'll ask you to wait out a period of **three (3) months** from the date of your last offense before we consider an appeal from you to let you back into the game.

### My account has been stolen!

**Try using [the password recovery page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot) to see if your account's email is still valid.**

If this succeeds, you will be able to reset your own password without the assistance of the support staff.

If this does not work for you, please send us a support ticket immediately to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) with as much identifying information as possible that will help us establish you as the owner of your account. 

Emailing from your registration address is a huge bonus here, as well as any other information you can provide that only the holder of the account would know.

Please do not include replay or score data in your ticket - we cannot use this to verify your ownership of the account.

### Can I make more than one account?

**Unfortunately, no, you can't.**

If we were to allow everybody to make and play on multiple accounts, the ranked scoreboards would be nearly worthless! 

Other games encounter this issue a lot with what is commonly known as "smurfs" - accounts with low playtimes and totals that inflate the rankings and prevent other users from playing competitively.

In osu!, we are very much against users having multiple accounts, and we enforce a strict rule of only one account per person, ever.

You get to play on the first account you ever registered with us, and that's it!

### Is it possible to start over or have my account's statistics wiped?

**Not at the moment.**

We are considering extra 'score reset' purchases from the osu!store for the truly hardcore players who wish nothing but perfection in their stats, but as it currently stands, we cannot wipe an account's statistics for you.

This doesn't mean you can make a new account to do the same thing, either! Having multiple accounts is strongly frowned upon in our community and we will disable any such accounts that are brought to our attention.

### Can I change my account's username?

**Yes, absolutely!**

osu! supporters get **one** free name-change when they first purchase or are gifted a supporter tag, which can be redeemed at the [osu!store](https://store.ppy.sh/store/product/32).

At any point thereafter, you may purchase a username change to change your name to whatever you wish. However, each change will become progressively more expensive - the second will cost $8 USD, the third $16 USD, and so on. We do this to prevent people from abusing the system to change their names in rapid succession.

If you are only after minor capitalization or grammar/spelling changes, you can email [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) to request a free name change to fix these issues. We won't charge you for these sorts of name changes, but you **MUST** do them through a support email.

### Can I take another player's username?

**Yes, but only under certain circumstances.**

If a player has not logged in for at least 6 months and has no plays, their username may be reclaimed via the [osu!store player name change page](https://store.ppy.sh/store/product/32) for a standard fee associated with username changes.

For every 500 plays an account has across all game modes, an additional year (365 days) will be added to the time before that user's name becomes available. This is to prevent people from stealing the usernames of active or recently retired players.


### Can I play on a computer that another osu! user has used before?

**Yes, absolutely. This includes shared PCs like netcafes or PC bangs.**

So long as you are playing on only your own account, you can play osu! anywhere.

If you are playing from a public place, make sure to keep a close eye on your account security. Shared computers are often prime targets for malicious software.

### The website is telling me that I have tried to log in too many times!

**This is a temporary protection measure after repeated failures to access your account. Try logging in again after 10-20 minutes.**

If this happens to you, simply wait for a while and try to log in a little later. 

A couple of hours at the absolute maximum will clear the status for most people and allow them to log in again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Client

### osu! freezes when I click a link or multiplayer map!

Make sure you're not running osu! in compatibility mode through the osu!.exe propreties and make sure that you have a default browser set.

Right click the osu!.exe file in the osu! installation folder and click on Propreties, then go to the Compatibility tab and make sure that the checkbox under Compatibility mode is **not** checked.

If you're not running osu! in compatibility mode and the issue persists, make sure you have a default browser set. For some users that have Chrome as their default browser the issue will still occur for unknown reasons, so try setting Internet Explorer as the default browser and see if your issue persists after that.

### I can't login or connect to the game at all!

Please ensure that osu! is allowed full access through whichever firewall or anti-virus software you are using - internet connectivity is required to log into our game servers.

Even if your firewall policy allows other games through without adding exceptions, try adding one for osu! - it'll probably help!

If you are still having issues connecting to our game servers, please submit a support ticket by sending an e-mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) containing a trace route output log to the following addresses: *cho.ppy.sh*, *osu.ppy.sh* & *m1.ppy.sh*.

You can do this by opening the command prompt and typing `tracert <address>`. For example: `tracert cho.ppy.sh`. To open the command prompt press and hold the windows key and press R, and then type cmd and click OK. ([See this page for more information](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/314868).)

If you have a network.log file in the Logs folder (found in the osu! installation folder) please attach this file to your email after reproducing your issue.

### My PC reboots while playing osu!

This is usually caused by your graphics card or CPU overheating, or some other hardware fault.

To determine the cause more accurately, download a GPU/CPU temperature monitor and keep close watch over your hardware while playing osu!. If your hardware is regularly reaching temperatures of >90C / 194F, you may wish to try enabling the 120FPS/240FPS Frame Limiter in the game's options, as this will significantly reduce the load on both your CPU and GPU.

Alternatively, setting your CPU/GPU fans to 100% will help dissipate the building heat quicker - there are several applications which will allow you to do this, such as MSI Afterburner and SpeedFan.

If overheating is not the issue, you may wish to investigate your sound card - specifically whether its drivers are up to date or not, along with any peripherals you may have plugged in to your computer.

If none of this helps, please send in a support ticket to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) with more information on the issue - including your computer's technical specifications, model (where appropriate) and any other information you think may help us discern the cause of your problem.

### I have changed my settings, and now I can't start osu! or it freezes.

Some computer configurations can get affected by unusual configurations with largely unknown causes. If you happen to change your settings into state that osu! is unusable, there is still possibility to recover osu! without reinstalling.

Fixing osu! using recovery dialog:

- Hold down the `Shift` key on your keyboard.
- While holding `Shift`, double click the osu! icon on your desktop.
- Continue holding `Shift` until you see the recovery dialog prompt. From there, change your settings to the last known working configuration for you.

If you don't remember what your settings were before, you can use the most optimal configuration below.

Optimal Configuration:

- **Resolution:** Your monitor's native resolution. Your native resolution will have "(native)" written behind the dimensions in the drop-down menu.
- **Frame Limiter:** 120fps
- **Renderer:** Check the Compatibility Mode checkbox.
- **Release Stream:** Stable (Latest).

### I can't hold more than a few keys at once while playing osu!mania.

This is due to an issue that most keyboards suffer from called "**ghosting**", where certain key combinations cannot be pressed together. Many newer keyboards can allow up to **6** keys to be held down at once, mostly in random combinations.

There are applications available that will help you determine the maximum number of concurrent keypresses that your keyboard can handle. [Check this link for one](http://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/content/projects/AntiGhostingExplained.aspx)!

Keep in mind that most of the ranked osu!mania maps are designed to prevent the influence of ghosting in most cases, by only allowing up to 6 simultaneous key presses at once.

If you cannot reliably play osu!mania due to ghosting issues, then your only recourse is to purchase a keyboard which is capable of handling more key presses at once. Ideally a keyboard with "n-key rollover" or "NKRO".

### My mouse cursor goes crazy whenever I try to play osu!

If you are seeing two cursors, cursor jumps when you move or its movement is simply unnatural, you should make sure that Mouse Sensitivity in options is set to 1.0x. If the mouse cursor is too sluggish and moves far too slowly, try some of the options below, depending on what peripheral you are using:

- Mouse: check if your mouse supports a manual setting of DPI (dots per inch). If so, try adjusting it to alter your mouse sensitivity over using the Mouse Sensitivity slider in osu!'s options.
- Tablet: If you have recently bought a new tablet, and you feel like your mouse is too slow, check out [this screenshot](http://w.ppy.sh/d/dc/Tabarea.png) for instructions on how to change your area.
- osu! Tablet: osu! tablet is one of tablets that supports raw input - just enable Raw Input in the options and adjust your Mouse Sensitivity like you would a mouse!

### My song list keeps scrolling!

- Go to Options, from there find and disable Joystick support.
- If the previous step doesn't help, disconnect your input devices from PC one by one, and see if the issue clears itself up. If this works, check the peripheral for any faults that may be causing input to be sent to your computer, such as a jammed button, or even a broken USB slot.
- If after disconnecting all your input devices from your PC the problem is still present, go and check for any programs running in the background - some of them may be emulating you holding down a key or mouse button, especially driver applications or software such as Xpadder and X-Mouse Button Control.
- This can also happen due to an issue with the numpad keys that scroll the song selection list and the Shift or Numlock key. In this case simply press the Numlock key to disable the numpad and then press the key that corresponds to the scrolling (usually 9 or 3). To avoid this in the future be sure to release the number key before releasing the shift key, or be sure to not disable the numpad while a number key is pressed.

### I downloaded a Beatmap Pack but osu! is always trying to "repair" the file!

Once a pack has been downloaded, extract the .rar into your osu! Songs directory. All songs are still .zip'd and/or .osz'd inside the pack, so osu! will need to extract the beatmaps itself the next time you go into Play mode. Do **not** extract the zip's/osz's yourself, or the beatmaps will display incorrectly in osu and will not function properly.

### My game won't update properly!

osu! generally keeps itself up-to-date without any help, but sometimes things can go wrong. This is usually due to unique circumstances on your PC. Here are the steps you should take if updating is failing:

- Restart your PC. This will solve a lot of issues, even if you think it may not. Please do this first before continuing.
- Make sure your release stream is set to stable. From the main menu, click Options and find the UPDATES section (near the top). Change your release stream to stable. An image is here.
- [Try running the updater manually](http://w.ppy.sh/0/01/UpdaterIssues2.png).
- Force the updater to run by creating a text (`.txt`) document in your osu! folder called "help", then running the game like normal.

### I get an error about "font styles" when I try to open the game!

If you see this error when you try to open osu! or its updater, it means you deleted or otherwise lost important system fonts that ship with Windows. These fonts are used all over the Windows OS, so you can expect other assorted problems, such as wrong fonts, missing text, and other app crashes throughout Windows.

Here is a collection of common fonts used in different versions of Windows and across the web which should help:

- [Microsoft core web fonts](http://web.nickshanks.com/fonts/microsoft-core-web-fonts) (especially Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, and Verdana)
- [Tahoma](http://www.boldfonts.com/fonts/Tahoma/)
- [Windows Live Essentials](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other) (Segoe UI)
- [Powerpoint 2007 Viewer](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=048dc840-14e1-467d-8dca-19d2a8fd7485&displaylang=en&pf=true) (Cleartype family--Calibri, Consolas, Corbel, ... Nothing in osu! or your system depends on these, but these fonts are awesome! Download now gogo!)
- [Microsoft JhengHei](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?DisplayLang=en&id=12072) (微軟正黑體) (Traditional Chinese UI font)

See [this topic](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_programs/font-tahoma-does-not-support-style-regular/80ad7a97-230f-41d4-9101-107a0bfa986a) in Microsoft Answers for some more detailed advice, and other options on getting them back.

### I became supporter but my name isn't yellow in-game!

Don't worry! You are visible to others as yellow, but on your own screen your username will always be white. This is so you can easily identify your own messages from everyone else's.

### Some of my beatmaps are missing!

There are a few possibilities which can make your maps appear to be missing or deleted, but this is almost always a recoverable scenario. Here are a few things to try:

- Make sure you do not have osu! set to only display beatmaps within a certain difficulty range.
- Press `F5` on the song selection screen for osu! to reprocess your beatmaps. If only some of your beatmaps were imported this should solve your issue.

### I receive some sort of server-side error when trying to play online!

Are you using an open connection, such as a proxy, VPN or university campus internet?

If so, sometimes our systems will automatically blacklist these networks in an effort to reduce cheating behavior. Try using another proxy or VPN provider - if all else fails, send in a support ticket via mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh).

If you are not using any of the above, then you will need to send in a support ticket, as your connection has likely been blacklisted in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Website

### I haven't received a reply to my support ticket and it's been over 2 weeks!

**The vast majority of the time, this is due to a high number of tickets coming into our system at once.**

You can always send a single reply to your currently-open ticket asking about the state of your case, but make sure not to do this more than once or twice a week.

In rare circumstances, support tickets from chronically offending users may be deliberately ignored, though the team will **always** tell you when they will no longer be responding to you first. If you haven't received a notification like this, you don't need to worry about it!

### My user page has been locked and I can't edit it!

**This can happen if your user page had inappropriate content on it as defined by our [community rules](/wiki/Rules).**

In such cases, you may open up a ticket with the support team by emailing [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) and discussing your situation with them.

Most of time, you'll be allowed to access and alter your user page again, but users who abuse this amnesty may find themselves unable to edit their userpage at all, so be careful!

If at any point you are in doubt as to whether something is appropriate for a userpage, you may message any of the members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) with what you plan to put up and they'll let you know if it's okay.


### Can I completely block another user from contacting me?

**Yes, absolutely.**

In the event that another user is harassing you via private messages either on the forums or via the game client itself, there are a few steps that you can take yourself to filter out their messages.

#### Blocking a user from contacting you in-game

**To block a user from sending you messages in-game, simply add them to your ignore list.**

1. Click the Options menu button in-game
2. Type 'ignore' to filter the options listing to the "Chat Ignore List" section.
3. Add the offending user's username to the list, separating each new user with a space, and replacing any spaces in their name with underscores (A user called _The Gatekeeper_ becomes _The\_Gatekeeper_ for example).
4. You're done! 

You'll no longer see public chat messages from any users on that list, or receive private messages from them.

#### Blocking all non-friends from sending private messages in-game

If you wish to prevent anyone not on your friendslist from sending you private messages, follow the following steps. **Please note: moderators are not affected by this functionality and can always PM you. If you feel a moderator is harassing you in spite of this, you should contact [our support team](mailto://support@ppy.sh).**

1. Click the `Options` menu button in-game or hit `Control` + O on your keyboard
2. Type "block" to filter the options listing to the "In-game Chat" section.
3. Toggle the setting on by clicking it.
4. You're done! Users who are not on your friendslist (/addfriend "user") can no longer contact you.

#### Blocking public forum posts from a user

**To naturally hide most public forum posts of a particular user, add them to your Foes list via the UCP.**

1. Head over to the [foes list setting in the UCP](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=zebra&mode=foes) and simply add their username to the list as pictured.
2. Click submit.
3. You're done! Most forum posts from that user will no longer be visible to you - it will be as if they are never there. Do note that other users quoting their posts will still be visible.

#### Prevent any new forum private messages from reaching you

**To delete all incoming forum private messages before they ever arrive, make an [automatic filtering rule in the UCP settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=pm&mode=options).**

1. Head on over to the PM filtering section in the [UCP](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=pm&mode=options).
2. At the very top of the page, look for a column titled `Add new Rule`.
3. Click the first dropdown box (default value is Subject) and change it to `Sender`, then click Next.
4. Click the first dropdown box again and change its value from "is like" to "is" (third option in the list), then click Next.
5. Enter the offending user's username into the textbox that appears, then click Next.
6. Click the first dropdown box once more and change its value to "Delete message", then click "Add Rule".
7. You're done! Any attempts the user makes to contact you via forum PMs will now be automatically deleted without warning to you.

#### What if I'm still having problems with a user after blocking them?

**Never fear, our moderation team will help you out.**

If a user is still harassing you via other means, or using their friends or someone else to circumvent your effort to block them, please send us an email at [support@ppy.sh](mailto://support@ppy.sh).

Make sure to include any chatlogs or other evidence in the email, and our support staff will look into your case and see it sorted for you.

### What are these "user pages" that I see on other players profiles?

**User pages are special profile elements that all osu!supporters get access to. They can contain whatever you like - pictures of your achievements, your beatmaps, basically anything you wish!**

osu!supporters are given the privilege of editing their very own page for display on their profile for the world to see. User pages may contain anything you like - so long as it follows the [community rules](/wiki/Rules)!

Even if your supporter tag happens to run out, your user page will remain visible and you will still be able to edit its contents.

### Do I need to use my email address to register?

**No, you don't. We authenticate your account by having you log in via the game client, so an email is not necessary during the registration process.**

If you have trouble connecting via the game client, please check your firewall and anti-virus settings to make sure osu! isn't being blocked.

While having an email isn't required, we do recommend that you associate one with your account, as if you ever lose your password or cannot access your account, your registration email is our first point of contact with you.

### Why can't I search for a beatmap artist who's name is less than 3 characters long?

**Our local search engine can't handle this due to technical limitations, but you can still search using the Google Custom Search bar at the top left of most pages on the site.**

Simply type the name of the artist you're searching for into the Google Custom Search bar and Google will do the rest.

### Why are the statistics in my user profile page wrong?

**You might be looking at your stats for another game mode! The website defaults to showing your scores for the mode you last played.**

If you have been inactive for a lengthy period of time and your statistics are shown wrong, simply play a few maps to display them again. Inactive users can have their scores hidden to keep the rankings fresh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gameplay

### My combo counter, score display or accuracy display is missing!

**Pressing `Shift` + `Tab` by default will toggle the in-game HUD and allow you to see these elements again.**

If you have changed the keybinding that toggles the scoreboard, this will not work. You can check which key it is set to in `Options` -> `Change keyboard bindings` -> `In-Game` -> `Toggle Scoreboard`.

### My local scores are missing!

There's a few reasons why this can happen. Read on below!

#### Have you recently reinstalled the game client?

**Reinstalling the game client will automatically clear all of your local scores.**

These are unfortunately, gone.

The scores you have submitted online are still there, however - simply redownload any song that you have played before, and your score will reappear.

Handy tip - if you're an osu!supporter, you can use the `Ranked (Played)` filter in the osu!direct panel in game or via [the beatmap listing page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist?m=-1&r=7&g=0&la=0&ra=) to find any maps that you have set scores on in the past.

#### Are you set to the correct game mode?

**Playing another game mode (osu!taiko, osu!catch or osu!mania) will swap the in-game score view to only show scores for that mode. This will hide your scores from other modes.**

A common cause of this problem arises from playing maps of another game mode, which then automatically set song selection to use that mode's scores until the mode is set back again. 

You can change the game mode by clicking the `Mode` button at the bottom left of the screen in song select, then choosing the appropriate mode that you are looking for your scores in.

#### Are you playing offline?

**Unfortunately, scores set while playing offline cannot be added to the online rankings.**

If you are playing online and suffer a brief disconnection for whatever reason, your game will automatically try to send the scores itself for as long as you keep the client open.

#### Have you recently downloaded a large number of maps? (ie: a beatmap pack or bundle)

**Scores can sometimes take a little while to download from the game servers if you've loaded lots of new maps at once.**

Playing the game or doing something else will let the client catch up in the background.

### What is this white trail or smoke-like line behind my cursor?

**This is a special feature called _smoke_ and can be used to doodle on your playfield for fun. Anyone who is spectating you can see the things you draw as well.**

The default keybinding for this feature is `C`, and it will work for as long as you hold the button down. You can rebind it at any time in the `osu! Standard Mode` section of the `Change keyboard bindings` options dialog.

### How do I save my own replay of a score I just made?

**Enter the post-game results screen by clicking the score in your local scoreboard, and hit the `F2` button.**

This will save your shiny new score as a `.osr` file in the /Replays/ folder within the default osu! installation directory.

*osu!* also automatically saves all replays after you complete a song under the `/Data/r/` folder, also contained within the osu! installation directory.

Please note that if no replay was saved for the score you will not be able to retrieve a replay by doing this.

### osu! is telling me that my game client is too old!

**It's time to upgrade! Very old versions of the game aren't allowed to submit new scores, so you'll need to force an update by going into `Options` -> `General` -> `Run osu! updater`.**

If this doesn't work, you can close osu! and restart the osu.exe while holding down the `Shift` key. This will provide you with a few upgrade and repair options, one of which is to update your game to the latest version.

### My scores aren't submitting!

Oops! There's a few reasons why this can happen. Let's go through them:

#### Were you connected to the Internet while playing?

**If you were not able to access the Internet when finishing your score, it may not submit.**

This can be frustrating if you play on an unstable connection, though the game will try its best to resubmit your score for as long as you leave the client open.

#### Is osu! allowed in your local firewall or anti-virus suite?

**Some firewalls or anti-virus suites can block osu! from accessing the internet, which will prevent it from sending scores.**

Check your software of choice to make sure that `osu!.exe` in the directory you installed the game in is allowed to access the internet.

#### Are you running lots of programs in the background?

**Some can interfere with your ability to submit scores.**

Try closing any extra programs before playing osu! if you find that your scores aren't submitting and you're not having issues with connectivity otherwise.

#### Are the score submission servers up?

**The answer is almost always yes, but check [stat.ppy.sh](https://stat.ppy.sh) or the [@osustatus twitter](https://twitter.com/osustatus) to make sure everything is running smoothly on our end.**

If the servers are offline, don't close _osu!_ until we've fixed the issues and the servers come back up, and the game will try to submit your score again for up to an hour before it gives up.

#### Can you upload a score I set for me?

**Unfortunately, we cannot upload scores upon request.**

If you were denied a score due to technical reasons or whatever else, the best you can hope for is to repeat your display of skill and achieve it again. Sorry!

### The notes seem out of sync or out of time with the music!

**This can be due to sound processing software running on your machine, such as _Razer Surround Audio_. It could also be due to your `Universal Offset` being set incorrectly.**

Try closing any extra programs which alter or influence the sound coming out of your computer. If this doesn't help, you could try to adjust your `Universal Offset`.

Every individual hardware configuration has a particular `Universal Offset` that determines whether you hear the game's audio a little later or earlier.

The default values work for most people, but if you find it isn't for you, you can change it by following these steps:

- Go to the `Options` menu, and find the `Universal offset` slider under the `Offset Adjustment` header. The default value is 0, and you should only change it if needed.
- If the default value (0) isn't working for you, try using the `Offset wizard` button to walk you through setting a new one.
- If this still doesn't help, you may want to try updating your sound card or motherboard audio drivers.

### I'm experiencing lag spikes or stuttering during play!

**There's many reasons why the game may perform inconsistently, from programs on your computer, to out-of-date drivers, or simply having some settings too high.**

#### Do you have lots of programs open at the same time while playing osu!?

**Some background processes can fight with osu! for resources and make the game very unpleasant to play.**

Try closing some programs that you don't need open while playing the game.

#### Is your computer secure?

**Viruses, spyware, malware or other unwanted software can cause serious performance problems for even high-end computers.**

Keep your computer clean and safe and you might notice an improvement.

#### How old is your computer?

**Very old computers that use even older Intel Integrated graphics chipsets may not be powerful to handle osu! at all, even on the lowest settings.**

The only way to deal with this one is to upgrade your computer!

#### Are your drivers up to date? 

**Old drivers can cause serious performance issues. Make sure you keep all of your drivers up to date for everything wherever possible.**

Graphics card drivers are particularly important for osu!, as well as sound card drivers.

#### Are you using a USB hub to connect lots of USB devices to your computer through one USB cable?

**Connecting too many devices to one port via a splitter can cause input lag which is hard to detect but can seriously throw off your game.**

An easy solution to this is to try unplugging your USB hub briefly. If your lag disappears, you know why!

#### Are you running osu! in windowed or borderless mode?

**Both windowed and borderless mode introduce a _slight_ amount of input delay. Fullscreen is optimal for the smoothest gameplay experience.**

#### Does your game freeze up for only a moment or so?

**Sometimes background processes or other applications on your computer can send big requests for resources all at once, which will make your machine struggle.**

This usually clears up after closing everything non-essential before playing osu!. Torrenting software is a big culprit for this, especially if it shares space with the drive that osu! is installed on.

#### Has the game recently updated?

**Sometimes after a game update, the client may struggle for seemingly no reason. A simple reboot/restart of your machine will fix it.**

### My game looks glitchy, like the graphics are torn!

**This is due to an effect called [screen tearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) and can be fixed by setting the in-game `Frame　limiter` option to `VSync`.**

This is a completely harmless (albeit ugly!) effect that happens because the game's refresh rate is not synced up with your monitor's refresh rate. 

You can also try playing in Windowed or Borderless mode, which will use your operating system's native VSync instead.
 
Turning on VSync or playing in Windowed or Borderless mode will introduce a _slight_ amount of input lag, unfortunately. For most people, this will not cause significant issue.

Later NVidia graphics cards have a global option in the NVidia Control Panel to set the global refresh rate to a setting called 'Fast', which will also fix this issue.

## Installation and Registration

### How do I download osu!?

Simply click **`Download`** in the top bar of any page on the [official osu! website](https://osu.ppy.sh/).

Alternatively, [click here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/download) for a direct link to the download page.

### Where do I register for osu!?

Simply click **`I'm new!`** in the upper right corner of any page on the osu! website, or visit the page directly through [this link](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/register).

We do not use email authentication for registering a new account unlike many other sites - simply logging into the game client with your brand new account will activate your account for full play, and render it safe from our daily purges.

If you create your account and do not authenticate it by logging into the game once, the wayward account will be purged from our databases within a day. Ensure that you authenticate it soon after make it!

### The game installer throws an error or does not work when I use it!

If game installer throws errors when attempting to install, you can try few things:

- Clean your PC - Scan with anti-virus software, clean the registry. A good program for general clean up is CCleaner. Scan both your computer files and your registry. The installer can fail if there are registry entries from a previous copy of osu! still present on your system.
- Try reinstalling .NET 3.5 Framework. [You can find it here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317051200/http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=21).

### I have 64-bit Windows and cannot install osu! correctly!

Try to install the 64-bit version of the Microsoft .NET Framework. This should come with the osu! installer, but in case it doesn't, [download it here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/0/e/20e90413-712f-438c-988e-fdaa79a8ac3d/dotnetfx35.exe).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Beatmapping and Editor

### How do I upload/update my map?

To upload your beatmap, go in the editor and hit `File` > `Upload Beatmap`. This will make your beatmap available for others to download on the website and create a dedicated thread for discussion. Updating a map is the same process for a map that has already been uploaded.

Each user has a limited number of maps they can simultaneously upload. Leaving a map inactive for a month (by not updating it or not posting in its thread) will send it to the Beatmap Graveyard. To update a graveyarded beatmap, you need to revive it first.

### I am supporter but I don't have 10 pending slots!

The number of slots available depends on the number of ranked maps you have.

By default, every user has 2 pending slots. One slot is added for every ranked map the user owns, up to a total of 8 slots. Being a supporter grants 2 additional slots, from 4 (without ranked maps) up to a total of 10.

### How can I delete my map?

The team does not take requests to manually delete uploaded beatmaps.

If your beatmap is in the Graveyard, you can delete it yourself by clicking the `Delete` button that appears next to the beatmap link.

### The beatmap you're trying to submit isn't yours!

In the editor, click `File` in the menu, then `Open .osu file in Notepad`. Check the line `Creator:` and make sure that it's set to your exact username, capitalization included. If it isn't, manually change it for every difficulty in your set, reload the map, and you should be able to submit it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tournaments

### I applied to play in an official tournament, but was denied!

We scrutinize every participant in our official tournaments closely before allowing them to play.

**If your account has any history of breaking our community rules, whether it is from multi-accounting, cheating or just generally being a disruption, you may be barred from playing in any official tournaments completely for a minimum of 1 year from the time of your most recent offense.**

In the event that this happens, you may not contest this decision with the tournament coordinators - as it is not their call to make.

Instead, you can appeal your case via a support ticket to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto://tournaments@ppy.sh) - but you must provide an absolutely convincing reason as to why we should overlook your previous account history and allow you to play, and there are no guarantees that we will even consider your request at all, given the timeframe constraints on organizing such large-scale tournaments.

If you are honest and forward with us in your appeal, you may be allowed to play in future tournaments - but you will still not be allowed to play in the tournament in which you were originally attempting to participate in.

To do so would be to denigrate the efforts of legitimate players who work hard to improve themselves for these tournaments, and who abide by our community rules without any prompting.

### I would like official support for a tournament/event that I am hosting.

We provide official support in the form of streaming support and prize donations to some well-hosted community tournaments and other events upon request.

After you have completed organizing your event and have a full roster of attendees and a proper structure, send in a support ticket to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto://tournaments@ppy.sh) with all the details you think we should know about your tournament/event, including:

- The timezone it will be hosted in
- A rough estimate of the number of participants
- A suggested prize pool
- Whether you require streaming support or not
- Anything else of importance

We may take some time to respond to your request, but we will give it ample consideration so long as you have prepared it properly.

### What does the official support for tournaments include?

Officially supported tournaments, at the discretion of the tournament team, may gain a number of benefits. These include (but are not limited to):

- osu!supporter prizes for the winners and (potentially) runners-up temporary use of the official osu!tourney tournament client for streaming and broadcasting
- Accreditation of the osu! team for providing prizes is required.

osu!supporter prizes are typically only given out to events or tournaments that are already well established and have a reputation for being organized and consistent.

Usually supporter prizes are limited to at most 3 months for the winning team, 2 months for the second place team, and 1 month for the third place team, but this may vary on a per-case basis. Teams may not exceed more than 5 people to be considered for osu!supporter prizes.

Tournament teams interested in obtaining these benefits need only to include their request in the initial query to the tournament staff for official support. The team member assigned to your request will handle the rest, and any questions you might have.

### Where can I get the configuration utility for the osu!keyboard?

The osu!keyboard configuration utility is available from [this link](http://puu.sh/l6urN/4b6bc800f2.zip). Simply extract it to anywhere on your computer, and run the executable!

The rest should be self-explanatory.

If you have any further issues, please feel free to submit a ticket to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) detailing your problem.

### The LEDs on my osu! nono keyboard aren't working!

Unfortunately, this is a relatively common issue with the nono keyboard. Many of the first nono keyboard units shipped were inadvertently sent with faulty LEDs, which require replacement.

However, the LEDs on the nono keyboard are also prone to corrosion interfering with the connection between the equipment and the mainboard.

To determine if your osu! nono keyboard LEDs are faulty, please undertake the following steps:

- Identify which LED is not functioning as it should be. Remember this side.
- Gently prise the LEDs from beneath the key switches with a pair of tweezers or other gripping device, remembering which LED came from which slot.
- Swap the LEDs around and return them to their housing. For example, place the LED taken from the left key to the right key, and so on.

You may also wish to try rubbing the base of the LEDs connectors with a small piece of aluminum foil to remove any oxidation that could be interfering with the connection, but this is entirely optional. If this has fixed your problem, then the issue was almost certainly oxidation on the LED connectors interfering with the device's functioning. If this issue reoccurs, you know how to fix it next time!

**If the "faulty" LED works when moved to the alternate slot, but the new LED inserted into the previous slot does not work,** then there is an issue with your unit's mainboard. You can request a replacement to be sent by sending an email to [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh).

**If the "faulty" LED does not work when moved to the alternate slot, but the other LED does,** then the LED is indeed faulty and subject to a replacement. Email [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) and request a replacement to be sent, detailing that you followed the instructions in this article.

**If neither LED works after swapping (and they didn't before), then they're probably both broken.** While we cannot conclude whether the mainboard is broken if both do not function, we will be happy to send out replacement LEDs for you to test before we send out a replacement unit entirely. Again, contact [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) and detail that you followed the steps in this article.

### How do I know if my osu!tablet is working or not?

Given that the osu!tablet is a two-unit solution (e.g. tablet and pen), it can be difficult to tell which unit is experiencing issues when things go wrong. To find out, perform the following steps:

**For the tablet unit:**

- Safely remove the device from your system, and unplug the cable.
- Gently plug the cable into a USB slot on your system.
- If the tablet is functioning, the light slot on the face of the tablet will flash green momentarily then fall dark. This is normal behaviour.

If the tablet's light does not flash, try using a different USB cable - the ones included with the tablet can sometimes be damaged during transit or after extensive use. If your issue still persists, please email [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) for further assistance (if your tablet is recently purchased, that is).

**For the pen unit:**

- Unscrew the grip from the body of the pen, exposing the battery on the inside.
- Remove the AAA battery from the pen.
- Replace the battery with a brand new AAA battery. Verify that the battery functions in another device first.
- Ensure that the battery's positive and negative ends are appropriate in the pen. There are markers on the device that display marks telling you which end goes where.
- Screw the grip back onto the pen.
- Depress the button on the back end (eraser end) of the pen until it clicks.

If your tablet unit is functioning properly, placing the pen near the tablet will make the cursor on your screen move. If this does not occur and you have followed the tablet verification steps listed above this section, then it is possible that your pen is broken or faulty. Contact [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) for further assistance, and we'll do everything we can to help you.

>Please note that we cannot assist in matters where the device has been damaged due to regular use or misuse. Pens damaged from high falls, broken nibs, or snapped tablets are well beyond our replacement policy. Sorry!

### My computer doesn't recognize the osu!go when I plug it in!

One of the very first shipments of the osu!go USB sticks contained units that were formatted in a manner that is not compatible with all PCs. Don't worry, your sticks aren't broken, they just need a little bit done to them!

Firstly, here are the files we included on the osu!go:
<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16332218/goodies.zip>

In order to make the drive usable, it depends on what you can see.

Right click on your Start button and choose "Disk Management"
<https://puu.sh/nkttH/54e192fbd1.gif>

**If you see the osu!usb drive come up but in a RAW state** (<https://puu.sh/nktuJ/05791b6fc1.png>), right click on the RAW partition and "Format" it to NTFS or ExFAT (ExFAT is compatible with more devices, but slightly slower).

**If it comes up but is unrecognised, you will need to partition it from scratch.** Please follow [this guide](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/reset/windows/index.en.html) for details on how to do that. Once partitioned appropriately, simply follow the step above this one to format it properly, then place the files from goodies.zip into the drive, and you're done!

If you encounter any issues, please send an email to [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) and we'd be happy to help you out.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I provide log files when asked?

*osu!* outputs a lot of information while running about its current state. You can provide these logs when troubleshooting issues. They can usually help in diagnosing and resolving problems which may otherwise be very hard to track down.

In order to get full log output, you first need to change your release stream to either `Beta` or `Cutting-Edge`. Full logging is not available on the stable releases as it has a very minor performance impact.

After replicating your issue, you can find the logs in your osu! folder.

- Click the `Options` button on the main menu.
- Click the `Open osu! folder` button.
- Locate and enter the Logs folder.
- Select the log required and upload it somewhere publicly available (or attach it to your email).

### Bancho Authentication Error

This usually happens when there are networking issues between you and our servers. Try the following:

- Make sure that you typed your password correctly. If you're unsure of what your password is, you can use the <https://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot> page to recover access to your account.
- If you are using any proxies or VPNs, disable them before attempting to connect again.
- Hold `Shift` while starting osu! and change to the `Stable (fallback)` release stream.
- If the error persists, change to the `Cutting Edge` release stream. Let osu! run for a few minutes, then contact [support@ppy.sh](mailto://support@ppy.sh) and provide the `network.log` file that you can find in the Logs folder.

If all these fail, you might need to contact your ISP to inquire about these problems.
