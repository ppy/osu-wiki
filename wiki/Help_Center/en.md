Here you can find assistance for multiple issues across various fields. Use the **Content Listing** to jump to your question directly!

## Account

### I've paid for a supporter tag, but still haven't got it!

Payments can take time to process, especially if you don't use Paypal, so be patient and wait 24 hours.

If you haven't used Paypal, contact xsolla support directly [here](https://support.xsolla.com/) and follow their instructions to resolve your issue. Supporter status is automatically given out as soon as we receive the funds - so the issue is on xsolla's end!

If you still haven't received your supporter tag after all this, please e-mail [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) with the confirmation receipt to get further support.

### What is "restricted" mode, exactly?

Restricted mode is automatically applied to accounts that are **suspected** of breaking our ToS rules regarding the use of third-party programs or creating multiple accounts, or for any other reason that we believe warrants investigation.

While restricted, an account is incapable of interacting meaningfully with the osu! online community at large. Scores submitted in restricted mode are saved, but are not visible to any other user.

**Restricted mode is not a cause for concern unless you have knowingly done something wrong.** Users placed into restricted mode are done so with a considerable degree of brevity - it is used in many situations where we feel deep investigation is warranted, and should not be taken by users to infer guilt or wrongdoing when placed initially.

In many cases, the status will be removed automatically after 24 hours if it is made in error. If not, please be patient. Sometimes this can happen while we are further investigating your account for suspected theft or foul-play.

If your account remains restricted for longer than a week, it is advised that you fill out form linked on the page that appears when you login to the website or on the link above in any page, as seen below:


Whatever you do, **do not attempt to make an additional account to circumvent the status.** This is grounds for immediate disabling of both your main account and the newly registered account. Do not attempt to play using a friend's account either as this will result in your friend's account being restricted as well.

We highly recommend being truthful and entirely honest with the support staff when inquiring about your restricted mode status, should it not be removed automatically after a week. We do not entertain excuses and lies, and you risk permanently losing the ability to play osu! online by doing so.

### The flag on my account profile is wrong!

Your nationality is automatically determined by the game based on where you register your account from geographically speaking, meaning that if you register an account in the US, your account will be automatically assigned as being from the United States, and also placed within the US country rankings.

We can change this upon request, but **you must provide proof of residency for the given country that you wish to change to.** A picture of any sufficient 100 points of ID (passport, driver's license) representing this **with the user's account logged in to the client in the background** is required for us to even consider your request.

This information will not be shared outside of the osu! support team and will be immediately deleted from our servers once it has been used to ascertain your place of residence.

Providing false information to us may result in your account being placed under permanent restrictions, or heavily silenced for upwards of a month.

### I've forgotten my username and password!

Please use <https://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot> to reclaim your account automatically, provided that you still have access to the email you registered with.

If you do not have access to your original email that you registered with anymore, or you have forgotten your username completely, please send in a support ticket via mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) listing as much, along with any information that we could use to verify that you are the account owner - such as the name of the original email address registered to your account.

It also helps significantly if you email us from your registration email, as this allows us to check whether you are the account owner without any further follow up.

### My account has been banned/disabled/permanently restricted!

First, sit down and think for a short while. Have you used any third-party cheating utilities or any other programs to try and get an edge over other users? Have you been making multiple accounts or otherwise violating our community rules?

If any of these sound familiar to you - then you have discovered the reason behind your ban without even having to send a ticket to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh)!

Rarely, if ever, are such actions carried out by our account support team without evidence behind them. In the game's history, less than a dozen cases have resulted in improper bans - it is **extremely** unlikely that your case is one of these.

Be truthful with us about the usage of any third-party cheating utilities or the creation of extra accounts. If you are found to be lying to us, we will cease responding to your tickets and prevent you from making any further ones.

You will remain banned for a period of at **least three (3) months** from the time of your initial ban/restriction.

After this point, we will accept a **single** appeal from you regarding the status of your account. This appeal must include **substantial, well-thought out reasoning as to why we should consider allowing you another chance in the osu! community**, and how we can be assured that you will not simply infringe again at a later point in the future.

We reserve the right to deny any and all appeal possibility based on a user's history, especially if it is particularly severe.

Users that are banned after having returned from a successful appeal will be permanently and irrevocably removed from the community, with no chance of reprieve or appeal. We will no longer respond to any correspondence sent by them through any channel, either.

### My account has been stolen!

Try using <https://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot> to see if your account's email is still valid. If this succeeds, you will be able to reset your own password without the assistance of the support staff.

Otherwise, send a support ticket to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) immediately - detailing (or from) your original registration email and an estimate of how long you believe that someone else has been using your account for, along with one or two recent passwords that you have used.

Please do not include replay or score data in your ticket - we cannot use this to verify your ownership of the account.

### Can I make more than one account?

Simply put, **no - you can not**. This is possibly our most enforced rule as far as things go, and it exists solely to keep ranking fair for the vast majority of players who obey the rules.

Under no circumstances will we do the following:

- Grant a "fresh start" or a stat wipe (except in utterly exceptional circumstances, which have only ever happened 3 times in osu!'s history)
- Delete or ban an old account so that a user may play on a new account
- Allow another player to take ownership of another player's account

You are only allowed to play on the first account that you have created. You will not be allowed to create a new account to play on, under any circumstance.

You can be permanently banned from osu! entirely for making multi accounts.

If you have made an account whilst being unaware of this rule somehow, cease playing on the account immediately and send in a support ticket to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) listing both your main and multi account(s). We appreciate honesty in this case, and will refrain from punishing users who choose to do this harshly.

### Is it possible to start over or have my account's statistics wiped?

**No.**

Stat or score wipes are almost never used except in utterly exceptional circumstances, and they are definitely not things done on request for users unhappy with their scores.

Making a new account to attempt and circumvent this rule will result in the wholesale loss of your ability to play osu! online, possibly permanently.

### Can I change my account's username?

osu! supporters can get change their usernames, which can be at the [osu!store](https://store.ppy.sh/store/product/32).

There are some points to username changes to know:

- The first username change is free of charge with your osu!supporter (only once). The second change costs $8 USD with subsequent changes duplicating the price. This is to stop people from recklessly changing their name too many times.
- Changing your username for changing capitalization is free once per name change. You can contact support for this.
- For minor changes (like Player223 to Player), you should contact support since they usually may change your username for free. For more complex changes, you should buy your username change like normal. **This only applies to removing (or adding) special characters such as numbers, hyphens or brackets. Any change to the core has to be purchased.**
- You can take an existing user's username **if they haven't logged in for at least 6 months when they have no plays. For every 500 plays across all game modes you must wait an additional year to take the username.** This means that to take the username of a user with a play count (combined over all modes) of 680, you will have to wait 1.86 years (or 678 days) from their last login.

If you regret a change you've made, contact support to ask it reverted. We will only change your username back to **your direct previous name** (if you've made several changes, we only revert the latest one) and **we will only do so once per account**.

### Can I play on a computer that another osu! user has used before?

Yes, absolutely. You will not be restricted or otherwise infringed for using *your* account on a computer that another osu! user has used. The only time sharing gets problematic is when it is done with accounts themselves.

So long as you are using only your account, you can play osu! anywhere.

### "You have tried to log in too many times"

This is a protection measure to make sure your account is not access by someone else. If this error message appears, cease trying to log in at all for a duration of up to 48 hours. You will then be able to log in normally.

### My account is "disabled"! What does this mean?

Accounts that have been disabled have been irrevocably purged by the administration for violations against our Terms of Service agreement.

Often, this is due to multi-accounting offenses, and if you are attempting to access a multi-account that is disabled, you will find that your first registered "main" account will still be accessible, though probably restricted.

Attempting to use a disabled account may force a temporary client lock in order to prevent further abuse. A locked client cannot be used for online play at all. The status fades automatically after several days. Attempts to circumvent this status will result in any associated accounts being disabled themselves.

Disabled accounts do not preserve online scores and are incapable of setting new ones. They cannot interact with the online community in any form whatsoever, and for all intents and purposes, are considered *deleted* by the administration at large.

Rarely, users with particularly egregious offenses may find their accounts disabled instead of restricted. Disabling can only be revoked by a senior member of the support team - so you will need to petition your case personally via ticket at [support@ppy.sh](mailto://support@ppy.sh).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Client

### osu! freezes when I click a link or multiplayer map!

Make sure you're not running osu! in compatibility mode through the osu!.exe properties and make sure that you have a default browser set.

Right click the osu!.exe file in the osu! installation folder and click on Properties, then go to the Compatibility tab and make sure that the checkbox under Compatibility mode is **not** checked.

If you're not running osu! in compatibility mode and the issue persists, make sure you have a default browser set. For some users that have Chrome as their default browser the issue will still occur for unknown reasons, so try setting Internet Explorer as the default browser and see if your issue persists after that.

### I can't login or connect to the game at all!

Please ensure that osu! is allowed full access through whichever firewall or anti-virus software you are using - internet connectivity is required to log into our game servers.

Even if your firewall policy allows other games through without adding exceptions, try adding one for osu! - it'll probably help!

If you are still having issues connecting to our game servers, please submit a support ticket by sending an e-mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) containing a trace route output log to the following addresses: *cho.ppy.sh*, *osu.ppy.sh* & *m1.ppy.sh*.

You can do this by opening the command prompt and typing `tracert <address>`. For example: `tracert cho.ppy.sh`. To open the command prompt press and hold the windows key and press R, and then type cmd and click OK. ([See this page for more information](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/314868).)

If you have a network.log file in the Logs folder (found in the osu! installation folder) please attach this file to your email after reproducing your issue.

### My PC reboots while playing osu!

This is usually caused by your graphics card or CPU overheating, or some other hardware fault.

To determine the cause more accurately, download a GPU/CPU temperature monitor and keep close watch over your hardware while playing osu!. If your hardware is regularly reaching temperatures of >90C / 194F, you may wish to try enabling the 120FPS/240FPS Frame Limiter in the game's options, as this will significantly reduce the load on both your CPU and GPU.

Alternatively, setting your CPU/GPU fans to 100% will help dissipate the building heat quicker - there are several applications which will allow you to do this, such as MSI Afterburner and SpeedFan.

If overheating is not the issue, you may wish to investigate your sound card - specifically whether its drivers are up to date or not, along with any peripherals you may have plugged in to your computer.

If none of this helps, please send in a support ticket to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) with more information on the issue - including your computer's technical specifications, model (where appropriate) and any other information you think may help us discern the cause of your problem.

### I have changed my settings, and now I can't start osu! or it freezes.

Some computer configurations can get affected by unusual configurations with largely unknown causes. If you happen to change your settings into state that osu! is unusable, there is still possibility to recover osu! without reinstalling.

Fixing osu! using recovery dialog:

- Hold down the `Shift` key on your keyboard.
- While holding `Shift`, double click the osu! icon on your desktop.
- Continue holding `Shift` until you see the recovery dialog prompt. From there, change your settings to the last known working configuration for you.

If you don't remember what your settings were before, you can use the most optimal configuration below.

Optimal Configuration:

- **Resolution:** Your monitor's native resolution. Your native resolution will have "(native)" written behind the dimensions in the drop-down menu.
- **Frame Limiter:** 120fps
- **Renderer:** Check the Compatibility Mode checkbox.
- **Release Stream:** Stable (Latest).

### I can't hold more than a few keys at once while playing osu!mania.

This is due to an issue that most keyboards suffer from called "**ghosting**", where certain key combinations cannot be pressed together. Many newer keyboards can allow up to **6** keys to be held down at once, mostly in random combinations.

There are applications available that will help you determine the maximum number of concurrent keypresses that your keyboard can handle. [Check this link for one](http://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/content/projects/AntiGhostingExplained.aspx)!

Keep in mind that most of the ranked osu!mania maps are designed to prevent the influence of ghosting in most cases, by only allowing up to 6 simultaneous key presses at once.

If you cannot reliably play osu!mania due to ghosting issues, then your only recourse is to purchase a keyboard which is capable of handling more key presses at once. Ideally a keyboard with "n-key rollover" or "NKRO".

### My mouse cursor goes crazy whenever I try to play osu!

If you are seeing two cursors, cursor jumps when you move or its movement is simply unnatural, you should make sure that Mouse Sensitivity in options is set to 1.0x. If the mouse cursor is too sluggish and moves far too slowly, try some of the options below, depending on what peripheral you are using:

- Mouse: check if your mouse supports a manual setting of DPI (dots per inch). If so, try adjusting it to alter your mouse sensitivity over using the Mouse Sensitivity slider in osu!'s options.
- Tablet: If you have recently bought a new tablet, and you feel like your mouse is too slow, check out [this screenshot](http://w.ppy.sh/d/dc/Tabarea.png) for instructions on how to change your area.
- osu! Tablet: osu! tablet is one of tablets that supports raw input - just enable Raw Input in the options and adjust your Mouse Sensitivity like you would a mouse!

### My song list keeps scrolling!

- Go to Options, from there find and disable Joystick support.
- If the previous step doesn't help, disconnect your input devices from PC one by one, and see if the issue clears itself up. If this works, check the peripheral for any faults that may be causing input to be sent to your computer, such as a jammed button, or even a broken USB slot.
- If after disconnecting all your input devices from your PC the problem is still present, go and check for any programs running in the background - some of them may be emulating you holding down a key or mouse button, especially driver applications or software such as Xpadder and X-Mouse Button Control.
- This can also happen due to an issue with the numpad keys that scroll the song selection list and the Shift or Numlock key. In this case simply press the Numlock key to disable the numpad and then press the key that corresponds to the scrolling (usually 9 or 3). To avoid this in the future be sure to release the number key before releasing the shift key, or be sure to not disable the numpad while a number key is pressed.

### I downloaded a Beatmap Pack but osu! is always trying to "repair" the file!

Once a pack has been downloaded, extract the .rar into your osu! Songs directory. All songs are still .zip'd and/or .osz'd inside the pack, so osu! will need to extract the beatmaps itself the next time you go into Play mode. Do **not** extract the zip's/osz's yourself, or the beatmaps will display incorrectly in osu and will not function properly.

### My game won't update properly!

osu! generally keeps itself up-to-date without any help, but sometimes things can go wrong. This is usually due to unique circumstances on your PC. Here are the steps you should take if updating is failing:

- Restart your PC. This will solve a lot of issues, even if you think it may not. Please do this first before continuing.
- Make sure your release stream is set to stable. From the main menu, click Options and find the UPDATES section (near the top). Change your release stream to stable. An image is here.
- [Try running the updater manually](http://w.ppy.sh/0/01/UpdaterIssues2.png).
- Force the updater to run by creating a text (`.txt`) document in your osu! folder called "help", then running the game like normal.

### I get an error about "font styles" when I try to open the game!

If you see this error when you try to open osu! or its updater, it means you deleted or otherwise lost important system fonts that ship with Windows. These fonts are used all over the Windows OS, so you can expect other assorted problems, such as wrong fonts, missing text, and other app crashes throughout Windows.

Here is a collection of common fonts used in different versions of Windows and across the web which should help:

- [Microsoft core web fonts](http://web.nickshanks.com/fonts/microsoft-core-web-fonts) (especially Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, and Verdana)
- [Tahoma](http://www.boldfonts.com/fonts/Tahoma/)
- [Windows Live Essentials](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other) (Segoe UI)
- [Powerpoint 2007 Viewer](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=048dc840-14e1-467d-8dca-19d2a8fd7485&displaylang=en&pf=true) (Cleartype family--Calibri, Consolas, Corbel, ... Nothing in osu! or your system depends on these, but these fonts are awesome! Download now gogo!)
- [Microsoft JhengHei](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?DisplayLang=en&id=12072) (微軟正黑體) (Traditional Chinese UI font)

See [this topic](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_programs/font-tahoma-does-not-support-style-regular/80ad7a97-230f-41d4-9101-107a0bfa986a) in Microsoft Answers for some more detailed advice, and other options on getting them back.

### I became supporter but my name isn't yellow in-game!

Don't worry! You are visible to others as yellow, but on your own screen your username will always be white. This is so you can easily identify your own messages from everyone else's.

### Some of my beatmaps are missing!

There are a few possibilities which can make your maps appear to be missing or deleted, but this is almost always a recoverable scenario. Here are a few things to try:

- Make sure you do not have osu! set to only display beatmaps within a certain difficulty range.
- Press `F5` on the song selection screen for osu! to reprocess your beatmaps. If only some of your beatmaps were imported this should solve your issue.

### I receive some sort of server-side error when trying to play online!

Are you using an open connection, such as a proxy, VPN or university campus internet?

If so, sometimes our systems will automatically blacklist these networks in an effort to reduce cheating behavior. Try using another proxy or VPN provider - if all else fails, send in a support ticket via mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh).

If you are not using any of the above, then you will need to send in a support ticket, as your connection has likely been blacklisted in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Website

### My support ticket was closed with no response!

This means that the support staff have determined that your issue is not appropriate for this service.

If you have been banned in the past, it is a warning call to be more truthful and forthwith in your responses, or you risk having your tickets permanently marked as "antagonistic", which cuts off your only recourse of becoming a legitimate member of the community again.

### My user page has been locked and I can't edit it!

If your user page has been locked, it means that one of our volunteer moderators has judged it to have content which is inappropriate for our community. Usually, these offensive pages are cleared first, and a warning issued.

Users which ignore this warning will soon find that they can no longer edit their user page, or even some aspects of their profile data. This is irreversible in most circumstances.

If you believe that you have had your user page access revoked in error or wish to restore access to it, feel free to file a support ticket via mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) listing why, including the previous contents of your user page. We may offer a final chance depending on the severity of your past offenses.

### How do I completely block another user from contacting me?

In the event that another user on the game is harassing you via private messages either on the forums or osu! itself, there are a few steps that you can take yourself to make the problem figuratively and literally disappear.

#### Block a user from contacting you in-game

**To block a user from sending you messages in-game, simply add them to your ignore list.**

1. Click the Options menu button in-game
2. Type 'ignore' to filter the options listing to the "Chat Ignore List" section.
3. Simply add the offending user's username to that list, making sure to separate multiple entries with spaces between them (RudePerson1 RudePerson2).
4. You're done! You'll no longer see public chat messages from any users added onto that list, nor receive private messages from them.

#### Block all non-friends from sending private messages in-game

If you wish to prevent anyone not on your friendslist from sending you private messages (useful if you are a streamer), follow the following steps. **Please note: moderators are not affected by this functionality and may PM you regardless.**

1. Click the Options menu button in-game
2. Type "block" to filter the options listing to the "In-game Chat" section.
3. Toggle the setting on by clicking it.
4. You're done! Users who are not on your friendslist (/addfriend "user") can no longer contact you.

#### Blocking public forum posts from a user

**To naturally hide most public forum posts of a particular user, add them to your Foes list via the UCP.**

1. Head over to the [foes list setting in the UCP](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=zebra&mode=foes) and simply add their username to the list as pictured.
2. Click submit.
3. You're done! Most forum posts from that user will no longer be visible to you - it will be as if they are never there. Do note that other users quoting their posts will still be visible.

#### Prevent any new forum private messages from reaching you

**To delete all incoming forum private messages before they ever arrive, make an [automatic filtering rule in the UCP settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=pm&mode=options).**

1. Head on over to the PM filtering section in the [UCP](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=pm&mode=options).
2. At the very top of the page, look for a column titled `Add new Rule`.
3. Click the first dropdown box (default value is Subject) and change it to `Sender`, then click Next.
4. Click the first dropdown box again and change its value from "is like" to "is" (third option in the list), then click Next.
5. Enter the offending user's username into the textbox that appears, then click Next.
6. Click the first dropdown box once more and change its value to "Delete message", then click "Add Rule".
7. You're done! Any attempts the user makes to contact you via forum PMs will now be automatically deleted without warning to you.

#### I'm still having problems with a user despite all this!

If a user is still harassing you via other means, or using their friends or someone else to circumvent your effort to block them out, send us an email at [support@ppy.sh](mailto://support@ppy.sh) with pictures of any incidents where this is happening, along with any chatlogs of the issue. We'll sort it out for you!

### What are these "user pages" that I see on other players profiles?

osu!supporters are given the privilege of editing their very own page for display on their profile for the world to see. User pages may contain anything you like - so long as it follows the community rules!

If your supporter tag runs out, your user page will remain visible and you will still be able to edit it.

### When I try to register, all the fields say "invalid request"!

This is a known issue, and we aren't yet sure what causes it. Some possible workarounds are:

- Make sure JavaScript is enabled and osu.ppy.sh is allowed to use it
- Register on another browser
- Registering on a different computer or Internet connection

If none of these solutions work for you, or the first two don't work and you have no access to another computer or internet connection, please contact support by sending an e-mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) and we'll try to get it resolved ASAP.

### Do I need to use my email address to register?

No - ***osu!* authenticates your account by having you log in to the game client.** If you have trouble connecting with the client, please check your firewall and anti-virus settings to make sure osu! isn't being blocked.

We highly recommend using an email address that you have regular access to (and is not a disposable 24hr "fake" email), as you will need to use the email to recover your password should you lose it, and also to talk with support representatives.

### I can't search for a beatmap artist who's name is less than 3 characters long!

Due to the limitation of the current search engine, it is simply not possible to search for less than three characters at once. If you want to find a specific artist with a short name, try using the Google Search bar at the upper left-hand corner and typing the artist's name in enclosed quotation marks - such as "Xi", for instance.

### My stats on the web are all wrong!

This is likely because you are looking at the wrong game mode. On your profile, click one of the four tabs to view your stats for the selected game mode. Your profile will automatically switch to whichever game mode you've last played.

If you have been inactive for a certain time and your stats are shown wrong, simply play a few maps to display them again. Inactive users have their stats hidden.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gameplay

### My combo/scores/accuracy display are missing!

*osu!* has a feature that toggles the HUD (scores, combo and accuracy). To enable or disable this feature, press `Shift` + `Tab`.

If you changed the keybinding that toggles the scoreboard, press and hold shift and press the key that toggles your scoreboard instead.

### My local scores are missing!

There are few possible causes for this:

**You have recently reinstalled the game client.**

Reinstalling the game client will automatically clear all of your local scores. The scores you have submitted online are still there, however - simply redownload any song that you have played before, and your score will reappear. If you are an osu!supporter, you can use the Ranked (Played) filter in osu!direct to find any beatmaps you may have submitted scores for in the past.

**I have the songs, and I am certain I achieved a score on this map!**

Are you sure you are set to the right game mode? A common cause of this problem arises from playing maps of another game mode, which then automatically set song selection to use that mode's scores until the mode is set back again. You can change the game mode by clicking the Mode button at the bottom left of the screen in song select - see this, and then selecting the appropriate mode that you submitted the score with.

### My scores earned offline aren't showing up on the online rankings!

Sorry, but scores can only be submitted to our servers while you are playing online - local scores cannot be manually added or sent to our servers. If you are playing online and suffer a brief disconnection, your score will automatically reattempt to send itself for as long as it is able to do so.

### I just downloaded a beatmap pack that I had before, and scores aren't showing!

This is normal - as you play other maps, the game client will automatically download the latest scores from the game servers gradually. Leaving osu! idle for a little while will do exactly the same thing, if you are impatient.

### White trails / smoke appears when playing!

These trails are a feature called **smoke** and can be used to draw on your playfield for novelty's sake. Anybody who is spectating you can see this smoke as well. Draw pretty pictures, or phallic objects to the amusement of your spectators!

The default keybinding for this feature is `C`, and needs to be held down in order to function.

**How do I remove it?**

If the smoke appears when you don't want it to, go to main menu and open the options menu from there, find the button named"Key Bindings" and click it to bring up the keybindings menu. In there, look for the entry named Smoke and change key used for smoke to a different key.

### How do I save my own replay of a completed song?

You can save your replay after you have completed the song, in order to do that:

- Enter the post-game results screen.
- Hit the `F2` button. That will save the replay in the /Replays/ folder under the osu! installation directory.
- You're done!

If you have forgot to save the replay at the end of the song, don't panic! You can always check the local ranking of your map, select the desired score, and hit `F2` to save a new replay manually.

*osu!* automatically saves all replays after you complete a song under the `/Data/r/` folder, also contained within the osu! installation directory.

Please note that if no replay was saved for the score you will not be able to retrieve a replay by doing this.

### I can't submit my score, osu! says my game version is too old!

If *osu!* doesn't update automatically, you can force update by going into Options and selecting Run Updater. Alternatively, you can close osu! and restart the osu.exe while holding shift. This will provide you multiple recovery options.

### My scores are not submitting, and I have everything updated!

- Check if you were connected to the internet while achieving the score - your internet might have just died when you achieved the score.
- Make sure your firewall isn't blocking *osu!* from connecting to the game servers.
- Close all programs running in background.
- Check if the score submission system is online. There is small possibility that osu!'s score submission system was offline while you have achieved your score, and it therefore couldn't send score. In this case don't close *osu!* until issues with score system are resolved as the game will try to re-send scores for up to 64 minutes after the initial attempt in case of failure.

Unfortunately, **we cannot upload scores for you - even by request.** If you cannot submit a score for whichever reason (due to technical issues or otherwise) you will need to reattempt the score at a later date once the issues are resolved. Sorry!

### The notes are not synced to the rhythm of the music!

There are a few possibilities which could cause that to happen. Here are the most common ones:

- Go to options menu, find Universal Offset setting and make sure it is not set to an incorrect value. The default value is 0, and you should only change it if needed.
- If your your issue persists when this setting is set to 0 try playing around with the Offset Wizard until everything is in sync.
- Make sure you are not running any sound processing software or surround sound in general. A piece of software that commonly causes this issue is Razer Surround Audio.
- If none of the above helped, you may want to try updating your sound drivers. These are typically bundled with the chipset drivers for your computer's motherboard.

### I'm experiencing lag spikes or stuttering during play!

Lag can be caused by a variety of things. Here are some common causes that may help if you're experiencing lag:

- Background processes, anti-virus software, etc.. Try turning them off while you are playing osu!.
- Viruses, spyware, trojans. If you don't have any anti-virus software at all, and your operating system and osu!'s performance seem choppy, you should try scanning your system with an anti-virus scanner.
- Your computer may be in need an upgrade - some really old computers utilizing old Intel Integrated graphics (such as GMA) may not cut it for osu!.
- Your drivers may not be up-to-date. One of the easiest ways of getting somewhat better performance is bringing your drivers up-to-date, especially your graphics drivers.
- Try turning off some visual settings from the options menu. If your problem is not fixed by any of these, try the advanced troubleshooting methods below:

**The game's behaviour (either audio, video, or both) is delayed from realtime.**

This could be a result of input lag. Make sure there aren' too many devices connected to the same USB port using a splitter. If the lag is system-wide, this is probably the case. Running osu! in windowed or borderless mode also causes a slight amount of input lag, so be sure to enable the fullscreen setting from the options menu to get around this.

Also make sure the Universal Offset setting found in the options menu is at 0. Only adjust this if hit objects and audio are not in sync when the setting is set to 0.

**The game's performance is choppy or stutters frequently.**

This might simply be caused by using a system with very outdated hardware. Aside from getting a more powerful system and checking the other sections in this article there is not much you can do in this case.

**Occasional momentary freezeups.**

Check if another background process is monopolizing your system for brief moments. This could be caused by other games, web browsers, or server apps (including file sharing/torrents). Close all other background programs and tray icons and see if the problem persists.

**FPS drops sharply after an update.**

This is known to happen to some users after some updates. Restart your PC to fix it in 99% of cases.

### Why does my screen look glitchy/cut/torn when there's motion? (VSync Off)

If you're running osu! in fullscreen with VSync turned off you might notice your screen looks glitchy/cut/torn when there is motion. This is called [screen tearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) and is actually nothing to be concerned about. It occurs because the game's framerate is not synchronized with your monitor's refresh rate.

In order to prevent screen tearing you can either set the framerate limiter setting to VSync (which will lock your framerate to your monitor's refresh rate) or disable the fullscreen setting. You can find both of these in the options menu. Please do note that both will come at the cost of additional input latency.

Alternatively, if you have the hardware support for either of these features, [G-Sync](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/g-sync) and [FreeSync](http://www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/technologies-gaming/freesync) are also framerate synchronization technologies that prevent screen tearing. These technologies do not suffer from additional input latency like VSync does, but they require your hardware (graphics card, monitor and display interface) to support it.

## Installation and Registration

### How do I download osu!?

Simply click **`Download`** in the top bar of any page on the [official osu! website](https://osu.ppy.sh/).

Alternatively, [click here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/download) for a direct link to the download page.

### Where do I register for osu!?

Simply click **`I'm new!`** in the upper right corner of any page on the osu! website, or visit the page directly through [this link](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/register).

We do not use email authentication for registering a new account unlike many other sites - simply logging into the game client with your brand new account will activate your account for full play, and render it safe from our daily purges.

If you create your account and do not authenticate it by logging into the game once, the wayward account will be purged from our databases within a day. Ensure that you authenticate it soon after make it!

### The game installer throws an error or does not work when I use it!

If game installer throws errors when attempting to install, you can try few things:

- Clean your PC - Scan with anti-virus software, clean the registry. A good program for general clean up is CCleaner. Scan both your computer files and your registry. The installer can fail if there are registry entries from a previous copy of osu! still present on your system.
- Try reinstalling .NET 3.5 Framework. [You can find it here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317051200/http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=21).

### I have 64-bit Windows and cannot install osu! correctly!

Try to install the 64-bit version of the Microsoft .NET Framework. This should come with the osu! installer, but in case it doesn't, [download it here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/0/e/20e90413-712f-438c-988e-fdaa79a8ac3d/dotnetfx35.exe).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Beatmapping and Editor

### How do I upload/update my map?

To upload your beatmap, go in the editor and hit `File` > `Upload Beatmap`. This will make your beatmap available for others to download on the website and create a dedicated thread for discussion. Updating a map is the same process for a map that has already been uploaded.

Each user has a limited number of maps they can simultaneously upload. Leaving a map inactive for a month (by not updating it or not posting in its thread) will send it to the Beatmap Graveyard. To update a graveyarded beatmap, you need to revive it first.

### I am supporter but I don't have 10 pending slots!

The number of slots available depends on the number of ranked maps you have.

By default, every user has 2 pending slots. One slot is added for every ranked map the user owns, up to a total of 8 slots. Being a supporter grants 2 additional slots, from 4 (without ranked maps) up to a total of 10.

### How can I delete my map?

The team does not take requests to manually delete uploaded beatmaps.

If your beatmap is in the Graveyard, you can delete it yourself by clicking the `Delete` button that appears next to the beatmap link.

### The beatmap you're trying to submit isn't yours!

In the editor, click `File` in the menu, then `Open .osu file in Notepad`. Check the line `Creator:` and make sure that it's set to your exact username, capitalization included. If it isn't, manually change it for every difficulty in your set, reload the map, and you should be able to submit it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tournaments

### I applied to play in an official tournament, but was denied!

We scrutinize every participant in our official tournaments closely before allowing them to play.

**If your account has any history of breaking our community rules, whether it is from multi-accounting, cheating or just generally being a disruption, you may be barred from playing in any official tournaments completely for a minimum of 1 year from the time of your most recent offense.**

In the event that this happens, you may not contest this decision with the tournament coordinators - as it is not their call to make.

Instead, you can appeal your case via a support ticket to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto://tournaments@ppy.sh) - but you must provide an absolutely convincing reason as to why we should overlook your previous account history and allow you to play, and there are no guarantees that we will even consider your request at all, given the timeframe constraints on organizing such large-scale tournaments.

If you are honest and forward with us in your appeal, you may be allowed to play in future tournaments - but you will still not be allowed to play in the tournament in which you were originally attempting to participate in.

To do so would be to denigrate the efforts of legitimate players who work hard to improve themselves for these tournaments, and who abide by our community rules without any prompting.

### I would like official support for a tournament/event that I am hosting.

We provide official support in the form of streaming support and prize donations to some well-hosted community tournaments and other events upon request.

After you have completed organizing your event and have a full roster of attendees and a proper structure, send in a support ticket to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto://tournaments@ppy.sh) with all the details you think we should know about your tournament/event, including:

- The timezone it will be hosted in
- A rough estimate of the number of participants
- A suggested prize pool
- Whether you require streaming support or not
- Anything else of importance

We may take some time to respond to your request, but we will give it ample consideration so long as you have prepared it properly.

### What does the official support for tournaments include?

Officially supported tournaments, at the discretion of the tournament team, may gain a number of benefits. These include (but are not limited to):

- osu!supporter prizes for the winners and (potentially) runners-up temporary use of the official osu!tourney tournament client for streaming and broadcasting
- Accreditation of the osu! team for providing prizes is required.

osu!supporter prizes are typically only given out to events or tournaments that are already well established and have a reputation for being organized and consistent.

Usually supporter prizes are limited to at most 3 months for the winning team, 2 months for the second place team, and 1 month for the third place team, but this may vary on a per-case basis. Teams may not exceed more than 5 people to be considered for osu!supporter prizes.

Tournament teams interested in obtaining these benefits need only to include their request in the initial query to the tournament staff for official support. The team member assigned to your request will handle the rest, and any questions you might have.

### Where can I get the configuration utility for the osu!keyboard?

The osu!keyboard configuration utility is available from [this link](http://puu.sh/l6urN/4b6bc800f2.zip). Simply extract it to anywhere on your computer, and run the executable!

The rest should be self-explanatory.

If you have any further issues, please feel free to submit a ticket to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto://accounts@ppy.sh) detailing your problem.

### The LEDs on my osu! nono keyboard aren't working!

Unfortunately, this is a relatively common issue with the nono keyboard. Many of the first nono keyboard units shipped were inadvertently sent with faulty LEDs, which require replacement.

However, the LEDs on the nono keyboard are also prone to corrosion interfering with the connection between the equipment and the mainboard.

To determine if your osu! nono keyboard LEDs are faulty, please undertake the following steps:

- Identify which LED is not functioning as it should be. Remember this side.
- Gently prise the LEDs from beneath the key switches with a pair of tweezers or other gripping device, remembering which LED came from which slot.
- Swap the LEDs around and return them to their housing. For example, place the LED taken from the left key to the right key, and so on.

You may also wish to try rubbing the base of the LEDs connectors with a small piece of aluminum foil to remove any oxidation that could be interfering with the connection, but this is entirely optional. If this has fixed your problem, then the issue was almost certainly oxidation on the LED connectors interfering with the device's functioning. If this issue reoccurs, you know how to fix it next time!

**If the "faulty" LED works when moved to the alternate slot, but the new LED inserted into the previous slot does not work,** then there is an issue with your unit's mainboard. You can request a replacement to be sent by sending an email to [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh).

**If the "faulty" LED does not work when moved to the alternate slot, but the other LED does,** then the LED is indeed faulty and subject to a replacement. Email [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) and request a replacement to be sent, detailing that you followed the instructions in this article.

**If neither LED works after swapping (and they didn't before), then they're probably both broken.** While we cannot conclude whether the mainboard is broken if both do not function, we will be happy to send out replacement LEDs for you to test before we send out a replacement unit entirely. Again, contact [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) and detail that you followed the steps in this article.

### How do I know if my osu!tablet is working or not?

Given that the osu!tablet is a two-unit solution (e.g. tablet and pen), it can be difficult to tell which unit is experiencing issues when things go wrong. To find out, perform the following steps:

**For the tablet unit:**

- Safely remove the device from your system, and unplug the cable.
- Gently plug the cable into a USB slot on your system.
- If the tablet is functioning, the light slot on the face of the tablet will flash green momentarily then fall dark. This is normal behaviour.

If the tablet's light does not flash, try using a different USB cable - the ones included with the tablet can sometimes be damaged during transit or after extensive use. If your issue still persists, please email [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) for further assistance (if your tablet is recently purchased, that is).

**For the pen unit:**

- Unscrew the grip from the body of the pen, exposing the battery on the inside.
- Remove the AAA battery from the pen.
- Replace the battery with a brand new AAA battery. Verify that the battery functions in another device first.
- Ensure that the battery's positive and negative ends are appropriate in the pen. There are markers on the device that display marks telling you which end goes where.
- Screw the grip back onto the pen.
- Depress the button on the back end (eraser end) of the pen until it clicks.

If your tablet unit is functioning properly, placing the pen near the tablet will make the cursor on your screen move. If this does not occur and you have followed the tablet verification steps listed above this section, then it is possible that your pen is broken or faulty. Contact [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) for further assistance, and we'll do everything we can to help you.

>Please note that we cannot assist in matters where the device has been damaged due to regular use or misuse. Pens damaged from high falls, broken nibs, or snapped tablets are well beyond our replacement policy. Sorry!

### My computer doesn't recognize the osu!go when I plug it in!

One of the very first shipments of the osu!go USB sticks contained units that were formatted in a manner that is not compatible with all PCs. Don't worry, your sticks aren't broken, they just need a little bit done to them!

Firstly, here are the files we included on the osu!go:
<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16332218/goodies.zip>

In order to make the drive usable, it depends on what you can see.

Right click on your Start button and choose "Disk Management"
<https://puu.sh/nkttH/54e192fbd1.gif>

**If you see the osu!usb drive come up but in a RAW state** (<https://puu.sh/nktuJ/05791b6fc1.png>), right click on the RAW partition and "Format" it to NTFS or ExFAT (ExFAT is compatible with more devices, but slightly slower).

**If it comes up but is unrecognised, you will need to partition it from scratch.** Please follow [this guide](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/reset/windows/index.en.html) for details on how to do that. Once partitioned appropriately, simply follow the step above this one to format it properly, then place the files from goodies.zip into the drive, and you're done!

If you encounter any issues, please send an email to [store@ppy.sh](mailto://store@ppy.sh) and we'd be happy to help you out.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I provide log files when asked?

*osu!* outputs a lot of information while running about its current state. You can provide these logs when troubleshooting issues. They can usually help in diagnosing and resolving problems which may otherwise be very hard to track down.

In order to get full log output, you first need to change your release stream to either `Beta` or `Cutting-Edge`. Full logging is not available on the stable releases as it has a very minor performance impact.

After replicating your issue, you can find the logs in your osu! folder.

- Click the `Options` button on the main menu.
- Click the `Open osu! folder` button.
- Locate and enter the Logs folder.
- Select the log required and upload it somewhere publicly available (or attach it to your email).

### Bancho Authentication Error

This usually happens when there are networking issues between you and our servers. Try the following:

- Make sure that you typed your password correctly. If you're unsure of what your password is, you can use the <https://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot> page to recover access to your account.
- If you are using any proxies or VPNs, disable them before attempting to connect again.
- Hold `Shift` while starting osu! and change to the `Stable (fallback)` release stream.
- If the error persists, change to the `Cutting Edge` release stream. Let osu! run for a few minutes, then contact [support@ppy.sh](mailto://support@ppy.sh) and provide the `network.log` file that you can find in the Logs folder.

If all these fail, you might need to contact your ISP to inquire about these problems.
