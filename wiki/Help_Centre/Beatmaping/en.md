## How do I upload/update my map?

**You can do this through the in-game editor.**

To upload your beatmap, go into the editor and hit `File` > `Upload Beatmap`.

This will make your beatmap available for others to download on the website and create a dedicated thread for discussion. Updating a map is the same process for a map that has already been uploaded.

Each user has a limited number of maps they can simultaneously upload. Leaving a map inactive for a month (by not updating it or not posting in its thread) will send it to the Beatmap Graveyard. To update a graveyarded beatmap, you'll need to revive it first.

## The editor is telling me that the beatmap I'm trying to submit isn't mine!

**This can happen if the creator of the beatmap is not properly set within the beatmap files.**

In the editor, click `File` in the menu, then `Open .osu file in Notepad`. Check the line `Creator:` and make sure that it's set to your exact username, capitalization included.

If it isn't, manually change it for every difficulty in your set, reload the map, and you should be able to submit it.

### I'm an osu!supporter, but I don't have 10 pending slots!

**The number of slots available depends on the number of Ranked maps you have.**

By default, every user has **2 pending slots**. 1 slot is added for every Ranked map the user owns, up to a total of 8 slots. Being a supporter grants 2 additional slots, from 4 (without Ranked maps), up to a total of 10.

### How can I delete my map?

**The team does not take requests to manually delete uploaded beatmaps.**

## FAQ

### Where can I get new beatmaps?

**The Beatmap Listing is a great place to start!**

*See also: [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps)*

To get there and download new beatmaps, go to [`beatmaps`](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) on the Home page. Just remember that you need to sign in in order to download beatmaps.

### Can I disable Kiai Time?

**No.**

You cannot disabled Kiai Time. This is because, unlike video, it's a feature integrated into the game (as a part with the [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_objects)), and thus cannot be disabled.

### The maps are too hard! Where can I find some easier maps?

**Some very kind community members have compiled sets of beatmaps for beginners for each game mode.**

For osu!, [Pokebis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8012) has compiled a set of beatmaps suitable for beginners to play. It can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/5456).

For osu!taiko, [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) has compiled a set of beatmaps for beginners to learn osu!taiko. It can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/175867).

For osu!catch, [-KevinChan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/564334) (formerly known as "Kingkevin30") has compiled a nice list of osu!catch beatmaps and basic explanation about osu!catch. It can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/131067).

For osu!mania, [Entozer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/277044) and [Drace](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/818340) (formerly known as "xxidraceixx") have compiled a decent list, sorted by relative player's difficulties, to provide experienced gameplay insight for beginners starting out in osu!mania. Their respective guides can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/147552), and [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/146615).

Alternatively, the website's beatmap search bar has a feature to [sort the ranked beatmap list by difficulty][sort beatmaplist difficulty]. The easiest maps are at the top of the list.

Lastly, [Rivenation](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2063554) (formerly known as "GeKKooo") did a project for [advanced beatmap searching](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/380485) called [osu!search](http://osusearch.com). Which not only has the same features as the official beatmap searchbar, but also has some neat features to define a specific beatmap requirement! The unofficial beatmap search bar can be found at [this link](http://osusearch.com).

You can delete your beatmap yourself by waiting for it to decay to the beatmap Graveyard, which it will do so after a month without updates.

Once your map is in the Graveyard, you can delete it yourself by going to it's beatmap page, clicking the `Discussion` button (which will bring you to its forum page), and then clicking the `Delete` button that appears next to the beatmap link.
