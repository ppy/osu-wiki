# Difficulty

*Not to be confused with [Beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap).*

A beatmap's **difficulty** is a game level, which is stored as a text file with [the `.osu` extension](/wiki/osu!_File_Formats/Osu_(file_format)). It consists of [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) of a certain [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode), which are set up accordingly to the [timing](/wiki/Glossary#timing-section) tailored to a specific song. Difficulties have different aspects, which directly affect user experience. The difficulty name and [star rating](/wiki/Beatmapping/Star_rating) usually give enough information to tell how challenging it is.

The hit objects of a difficulty compose [patterns](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern), which also vary per game mode and set the tone for overall look and feel of how a difficulty should be played. The gameplay of beatmap difficutlies can also be altered by various [difficulty settings](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup#difficulty) set by the beatmap's author or toggled by [game modifiers](/wiki/Game_modifier).

From the auditory perspective, a difficulty can augment the song by providing one or multiple sets of audio samples, or [hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound), that serve as an additional layer of feedback.

<!-- TODO: this description of visuals needs to be improved:
  - a separate section;
  - a very small paragraph on every key component, including those from Beatmap#overview;
-->

[Visual components](/wiki/Beatmap) of a difficulty, contrary to its patterns, provide auxiliary experience during gameplay and can be disabled in the [visual settings](/wiki/Visual_Settings) overlay for the most part. While some of them, such as [storyboards](/wiki/Storyboards) or [custom skins](/wiki/Skinning), belong to the beatmap as a whole, most of the visual components may vary per difficulty (e.g., [kiai time](/wiki/Kiai_time) sections and [combo colours](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_colour)).

## Difficulty levels

*See also: [Difficulty Naming](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Difficulty_Naming)*

These are the typical levels of difficulty that a beatmap can fall under. Specific definitions and requirements of each can be found in their respective mode's [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).

## Star rating

![Star rating ranges](img/SR-range.png)

On the website, beatmaps are automatically given a difficulty icon based on these star rating ranges:

- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/easy-s.png) Easy: 0.0★–1.99★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/normal-s.png) Normal: 2.0★–2.69★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/hard-s.png) Hard: 2.7★–3.99★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/insane-s.png) Insane: 4.0★–5.29★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/expert-s.png) Expert: 5.3★–6.49★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/expertplus-s.png) Expert+: 6.5★ and above

The intended difficulty levels of most beatmaps match the icons they are given, but some deviate significantly. This is why the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) define more precise rules for determining difficulty and evaluating beatmaps spreads.
