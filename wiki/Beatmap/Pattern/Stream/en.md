# Stream

A **stream** is an [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [pattern](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern) where many [hit circles](/wiki/Hit_object/Hit_circle) are placed close together and in quick succession. Streams usually represent high note density in a song and they are most commonly snapped to 1/4 ticks on the [timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines#hit-objects).

Streams are usually played with smooth movement, as opposed to the snappy movement of [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/Jump). Most streams require the player to alternate clicking between both fingers due to their speed.
