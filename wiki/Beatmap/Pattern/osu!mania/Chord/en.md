# Chord

A **chord** is a group of two or more notes that are hit at the same time. They are known to increase density and highlight different sounds within the music.

## Jump

Also known as doubles, **jumps** are two notes pressed at the same time. This is the most common chord type in 4K osu!mania.

The term comes from *Dance Dance Revolution* and similar games where performing doubles requires the player to literally jump between corresponding arrows on the controller pad.

## Quad and other chord sizes

**Quads** are four notes pressed at the same time. Past this amount of notes, chords are typically referred to numerically, such as "five-note chord", or "six-note chord". Larger chord sizes like these are more common in key modes higher than 4K.

## Grace note

**Grace notes** are two or more notes in different columns that are meant to be played in rapid succession from one another. This is commonly done with snappings higher than 1/6. During gameplay, they appear very similar to chords.
