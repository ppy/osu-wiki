# Stream

## Single-note stream

A **stream** is a constant set of notes with the same snap interval. There are many different types of streams that impose different levels of strain on the player. **Single-note streams** are the most basic stream type and are comprised of exclusively consecutive single notes.

A **roll** is a common variation of a stream consisting of notes that go across all columns in sequence.

Streams with notes appearing in intervals faster than one beat are typically referred to as **bursts**. They commonly use snaps higher than 1/4.

## Jumpstream

**Jumpstreams** are streams that involve [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Chord#jump). Usually, the stream itself is on 1/4 snaps while the jumps land on higher snaps. This is the most common type of stream pattern used in 4K osu!mania.

 This term is mainly used in 4K osu!mania.

## Handstream

**Handstreams** are streams that involve [hands](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Chord#hand), and may involve jumps as well. Like jumpstreams, the stream itself is on 1/4 snaps while the jumps land on higher snaps.

This term is also mainly used in 4K osu!mania.

## Quadstream

**Quadstream** is a term exclusively used in 4K osu!mania. Similar to the previous two types of streams, it is a stream that involves the usage of quads as well as other smaller chords. In 4K osu!mania, the quads in quadstreams create [minijacks](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Jack#minijack) with the note before or after the quad.

## Chordstream

**Chordstreams** are a type of stream which involve different chord sizes. The stream is usually on 1/4, with chords on every 1/1 or 1/2 snap interval. In key modes outside of 4K, "chordstream" usually refers to streams involving 3 or more notes within the chords. Thus, the term is almost exclusively used within non-4K key modes.

**Chordstreams** may also include **double streams**, which are two streams occurring simultaneously. These are more common within 7K and higher key modes of osu!mania.

## Bracket

**Brackets** are a specific type of chordstream involving the usage of 2 or more [trills](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!mania/Trill) occurring at the same time, though the trills may switch columns. They usually occur when chordstreams are quite dense with their chord usage and usually mix both one-handed and two-handed trills together.

This term is exclusive to non-4K osu!mania key modes.
