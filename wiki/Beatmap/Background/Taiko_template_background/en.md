# Taiko template background

A Taiko template background is a background image that is used to simulate authentic Taiko no Tatsujin gameplay. It usually includes a black bar showing artist and song title in white beneath the playfield.

Taiko template backgrounds were commonly used up until 2012, where they were disallowed in the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/osu!taiko) due to them not working as they were originally intended to on aspect ratios other than 4:3.

<!-- TODO: pinpoint when they were disallowed exactly -->

## Aspect ratio incompatibility example

The following example was made using the Taiko template background from [U2 Akiyama - Mystic Oriental Love Consultation [Gezo's Taiko Oni]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/24830#taiko/113409).

| Using 4:3 aspect ratio | Using 16:9 aspect ratio |
| --: | :-- |
