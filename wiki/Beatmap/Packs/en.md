# Beatmap packs

**Beatmap packs** are compressed archives containing [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) of a particular category. They can be found on the [beatmap pack listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs).

On average, beatmap packs are roughly 100 MB in size and contain all available beatmap assets, including videos.

## Naming

Beatmap packs are named after their content, category, and upload order. For example, in the following beatmap pack:

```
F2 - Rohi Pack.zip
```

`F2` indicates that it is the second beatmap pack available under the Featured Artist category, while `Rohi Pack` refers to the pack's name shown on the [beatmap pack listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/F2). In particular, this pack exclusively features maps of [Rohi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/82)'s songs.

Certain beatmap packs, especially in the Standard category, are also numbered by upload order. For example, [osu! Beatmap Pack #1000](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs/S1000) (pack `S1000`) is the 1,000th pack containing [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) and [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) beatmaps for the [osu! game mode](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!).

## Categories

Beatmap packs are split into 7 categories with a special letter indicator:

| Indicator | Category | Beatmap types |
| :-: | :-- | :-- |
| **S** | Standard | [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) and [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) beatmaps |
| **F** | Featured Artist | Songs from [Featured Artists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists) |
| **P** | Tournament | [Official tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments) mappools |
| **L** | Project Loved | Beatmaps chosen by the community in [Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved) |
| **R** | Spotlights | Seasonal beatmap challenge packs from the [Beatmap Spotlights](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights), formerly known as *Charts* |
| **T** | Theme | Beatmaps based on a particular theme |
| **A** | Artist/Album | Songs from specific artists or albums |

## Importing

1. Extract the downloaded beatmap pack archive. It should contain a lot of [`.osz` files](/wiki/Client/File_formats/osz_(file_format)).
2. Move these `.osz` files into the `Songs` folder under the osu! installation directory, or select the files and drag them directly into the game window.
3. The game should automatically import the beatmaps and delete the original `.osz` files. In case of issues, try pressing `F5` in the [song selection screen](/wiki/Client/Interface#song-select) to reprocess beatmaps.

## Alternative downloads

*Caution: osu! cannot guarantee that files from unofficial sources are safe, up to date, or complete.*

It is recommended to download beatmap packs directly from the official beatmap pack listing. However, if you have difficulty in downloading packs from there, there are several alternatives that you can use.

### Mirrors

As of now, all beatmap packs are stored internally in the `packs.ppy.sh` server. If in any case this server becomes inaccessible or slow to reach, there are mirror sites set up by others that you can use for your convenience as follows:
