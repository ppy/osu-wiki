# Guest difficulty

*For regulations surrounding guest difficulties, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

A **guest difficulty** (or *GD* for short) is a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmapsets) that is not created by the [beatmapset host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host). They can usually be identified by their difficulty name containing the guest creator's username. A beatmap featuring multiple creators is also known as a [collaborative difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_collaborations).

Many guest difficulties are often requested by private messages between creators. Although GDs can also be requested in [modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60)<!-- TODO: should link to an article about queues, not the forum -->.
