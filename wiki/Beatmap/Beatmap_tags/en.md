# Beatmap tags

*Not to be confused with [TAG difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/TAG_beatmaps).*

**Beatmap tags** are keywords that can be added to beatmaps to make [searching](/wiki/Beatmap_search) for them more convenient. There are two types of tags, each with their own purpose.

## Mapper tags

*For rules regarding mapper tags, see: [Ranking criteria/Metadata § Tags](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/Metadata#tags)*

**Mapper tags** are tags that describe useful background information about a beatmap or a song, e.g. the name of the album or the medium for which the song was produced for. As the name suggests, these tags are added by the beatmap host during the [ranking process](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

When entering a beatmap's metadata in the [song setup window](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Song_setup), the beatmap host is able to add custom keywords to the `Tags` field by separating them with spaces. Keywords that consist of two or more words may be written with the spaces between them replaced with an underscore (`_`) to allow for a more efficient beatmap search.

These keywords can then be set as a filter in [song select](/wiki/Client/Interface#song-select) as well as the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) via full-text search.

## User tags

*Note: This feature is not available in osu!(stable).*

**User tags** are tags that describe specific characteristics of a beatmap, such as its patterns or required skill sets. After achieving at least a C [grade](/wiki/Gameplay/Grade) on a beatmap, users are able to select and vote for user tags in the result screen in osu!(lazer). Upon receiving at least 5 upvotes, the respective user tag will be displayed in the beatmap information page.

To filter for beatmaps with certain user tags, click on the corresponding tag in the beatmap information page, or type in `tag="{name}"` in the beatmap listing where `{name}` is the name of any tag listed below.

The tables below list all user tags grouped by category as well as the game modes they are applicable in. Tags are currently sorted in the client alphabetically, but are planned to be manually sorted in the format below.

## Trivia

- The initial release of the user tags on 21 March 2025 was inspired from the [OMDB](https://omdb.nyahh.net/) project which had the similar goal of providing a user-curated tag system for beatmaps. Originally developed by ::{ flag=GB }:: [apollodw](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9558549), the project was retired on 1 March 2025 [due to personal reasons](https://x.com/bunnygirltwink/status/1892328084893815059).
