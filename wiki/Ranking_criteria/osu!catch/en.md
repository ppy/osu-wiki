# osu!catch ranking criteria

***Notice: This article is an extension of the [general ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).***

This set of **osu!catch ranking criteria** lays out [rules and guidelines](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) that [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch)-specific [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) must follow in order to progress through the [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

## Overall

Overall rules and guidelines apply to every kind of osu!catch difficulty. Rhythm-related rules and guidelines apply to approximately 180 BPM beatmaps with 4/4 time signatures. If your song is drastically faster or slower, some variables might be different, as detailed in [Scaling BPM on the ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/Scaling_BPM).

### General

#### Rules

- **Your map must be possible to SS.** This means it must be possible to catch absolutely all [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit), [drops](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop) and [droplets](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Juice_stream#droplet).
- **Each beatmap must use at least two different custom [combo colours](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo_colour) unless the default skin is forced.**
  - The combo colours must not blend with the beatmap's background, storyboard or video in any case.
- **Do not use keysounds without hitnormal support.** If sounds blend perfectly with the song, feedback for catching [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) is minimal.
- **If the [drain time](/wiki/Beatmap/Drain_time) of each difficulty is...**
  - **...lower than 2:30**, the lowest difficulty cannot be harder than a Salad, or provide a proper spread[^proper-spread] containing at least 4 difficulties.
  - **...between 2:30 and 3:15**, the lowest difficulty cannot be harder than a Platter, or provide a proper spread[^proper-spread] containing at least 3 difficulties.
  - **...between 3:15 and 4:00**, the lowest difficulty cannot be harder than a Rain, or provide a proper spread[^proper-spread] containing at least 2 difficulties.
  - **[Break times](/wiki/Beatmap/Break) may be combined with [drain time](/wiki/Beatmap/Drain_time) to meet the above thresholds.** For the highest difficulty, this is limited to at most 30 seconds of break time. This does not apply to difficulties with less than 30 seconds of drain time.

#### Guidelines

- **All [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) should represent a sound existing in the music.** This is usually a distinct sound but can also represent a continuous sound with an indistinguishable start or end.
- **The last [fruit](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) of a [slider](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Juice_stream) should be [snapped](/wiki/Beatmapping/Snapping) according to the song's beat structure.** For example, if the song is using a straight beat, 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 should be used. If the song is using a swing beat, 1/6 or 1/12 should be used.
- **[Dashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Dash) and [hyperdashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Hyperdash) should not be used when the destination of the dash or hyperdash is located near the left or right border of the playfield.** This creates an uncomfortable movement as the catcher is forcibly stopped upon reaching the border of the playfield (x:16 on the left and x:496 on the right).
- **[Combos](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) should not reach unreasonable lengths.** This ensures the player's view is not obstructed by the [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) stacked on the plate.
- The **[overall difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Overall_difficulty) should have the same value as the [approach rate](/wiki/Beatmap/Approach_rate).** This is just a standardised value, as overall difficulty only affects the maximum score of a difficulty with [ScoreV1](/wiki/Gameplay/Score/ScoreV1/osu!catch).
  - If a difficulty uses a lower approach rate than any of the difficulty levels below, then its overall difficulty should match the highest overall difficulty among those lower difficulties.
- **The [slider tick rate](/wiki/Beatmapping/Slider_tick_rate) should be set according to the song.** For example, if your song contains a section that uses 1/3 rhythms only, tick rate 2 would not fit the entire beatmap.
- **Avoid using [combo colours](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo_colour) with ~50 luminosity or lower.** Dark colours impact the readability of [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) with low background dim.
- **Avoid using [combo colours](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo_colour) with ~220 luminosity or higher if [Kiai time](/wiki/Gameplay/Kiai_time) is used.** Light colours create bright pulses during Kiai time, which can be unpleasant to the eyes.

### Skinning

#### Rules

- **Custom catchers must be included in the v2 skin format.** The needed elements can be found in the [osu!catch skinning article](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch).
- **Custom [fruits](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch#fruits) must include all necessary elements and be coloured in a scale of grey colours.** This is to ensure that your images are clearly defined and of acceptable quality. The needed elements can be found at [osu!catch skinning article](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch). It is recommended that transparent elements are used for the overlays.
- **Skinned elements must be the same size as their default skin counterparts.** This is so they represent the hitbox properly and don't alter gameplay.
  - [Fruits](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch#fruits) must be 128x128 pixels.
  - [Drops](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch#fruits) must be 82x103 pixels.
  - The [catcher](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch#catcher) must be 306x320 pixels.

## Difficulty-specific

Difficulty-specific rules and guidelines only apply to the difficulty level they are listed for and therefore *do not apply to **every** osu!catch difficulty*. Rhythm-related rules and guidelines apply to approximately 180 BPM beatmaps. If your song is drastically faster or slower, some variables might be different, as detailed in [Scaling BPM on the ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/Scaling_BPM).

- **[Dashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Dash) that are [basic-snapped](/wiki/Gameplay/Dash_snapping#basic-snapped) must not be used more than two times between consecutive [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) and [drops](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop).**

- **[Hyperdashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Hyperdash) cannot be used on individual [drops](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop) and/or slider repetitions.** The accuracy and control required are unreasonable at this level and can create a situation where the player potentially fails to read the slider path.
- **[Hyperdashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Hyperdash) of a different beat snap must not be used between consecutive [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit).** For example, a 1/2 hyperdash must not be followed by a 1/4 hyperdash.

- **[Edge dashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Edge_dash) must not be used.**
- **At least 125 ms must be left between [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) and the start of [spinners](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Banana).**
- **At least 250 ms must be left between [fruits](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Fruit) and the end of [spinners](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Banana).**

- **[Hyperdashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Hyperdash) that are [higher-snapped](/wiki/Gameplay/Dash_snapping#higher-snapped) should not be used in conjunction with higher-snapped [dashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Dash).** If used, those cannot involve [antiflow](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Antiflow), and the dash must be used before the hyperdash.
- **[Hyperdashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Hyperdash) that are [higher-snapped](/wiki/Gameplay/Dash_snapping#higher-snapped) should not be followed by [antiflow](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques/Antiflow) [dashes](/wiki/Gameplay/Dash).**

## Notes

[^proper-spread]: A "proper" spread *for difficulties Rain and harder* is defined as a spread with gaps in difficulty similar to those between lower [difficulty levels](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty#difficulty-levels) as specified in the [difficulty-specific criteria](#difficulty-specific).
