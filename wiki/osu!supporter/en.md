# osu!supporter

**osu!supporter** (or the ***osu!supporter tag***) is a temporary title given to players who support osu! by making a voluntary, monetary donation to help it thrive. Supporters receive a handful of cosmetic and technical benefits, most of which are active only when the title is present. The extra features from osu!supporter do not give any advantage in gameplay, performance, or score, and never will.

The osu!supporter tag may be obtained from the [osu!supporter store page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/supporter-tag).

## Features

### Heart badge

::: Infobox
![](img/usercard.png?2 "User card with osu!supporter")
:::

Supporters get a badge with hearts on it, usually found next to their username on the website. The amount of hearts depends on the duration of osu!supporter the user has acquired or received in total<!-- source: https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/blob/ac227d6abbd48630ebbf428c4e3372f388004ee5/app/Models/User.php#L1733-L1750 -->:

- Less than 1 year: 1 heart
- From 1 to 5 years: 2 hearts
- More than 5 years: 3 hearts

### Username colour

::: Infobox
![](img/chat.png "A person with osu!supporter in the chat")
:::

Usernames of active supporters appear bright yellow in [chat](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console) for other users.

### Editable profile section

Supporters receive a new profile section titled `me!`, often referred to as a userpage. The userpage serves as a personal editable space, where text is formatted using [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode). This feature is permanent and stays editable even after osu!supporter wears out.

The `me!` section may be a good place for:

- Banners, collabs, and infographics to spice up the profile
- A few paragraphs or items providing insights into a player's life
- A showcase of favourite maps, mappers, or anything else they consider important

### Profile cover

Supporters can further customise their profile by setting a cover image:

- Press the pencil icon in the lower right corner of the cover placeholder.
- Select a new cover from a few predefined options, or upload your own image (its dimensions should be 2400x640).

Once osu!supporter expires, the cover will remain, but cannot be changed.

### One free username change

*Note: Minor name changes may be requested from the account support team for free — see [Help centre/Account § Can I change my account's username?](/wiki/Help_centre/Account#name-changes).*

Getting osu!supporter comes with the ability to change usernames for free for the first time, under [usual conditions](/wiki/Help_centre/Account#name-changes).

### osu!direct

osu!direct is the in-game beatmap search and download engine available to supporters. It may be accessed from the main menu by clicking the vertical `osu!direct` label on the right side of the screen. In addition to a built-in beatmap listing, osu!direct provides other ways to obtain new beatmaps without leaving the game:

- Beatmap links in chat, which point to beatmaps on the osu! website, now trigger the download prompt in-game
- Automatic beatmap downloads while playing in a [multiplayer](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer) lobby or [spectating](/wiki/Gameplay/Spectating) another player, as an [opt-out setting](/wiki/Client/Options#integration)
- Automatic linking of currently played beatmaps in the `#spectator` chat tab for spectators, as an [opt-out setting](/wiki/Client/Options#alerts-and-privacy)

### Extended leaderboards

Supporters have access to several beatmap-specific [leaderboards](/wiki/Beatmap#leaderboards) available both in-game and on the website:

- Global rankings for every combination of [game modifiers](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier)
- Country-specific rankings of players bearing the same flag
- Friend rankings that show a player's position on a map compared to their friends

Additionally, bearers of osu!supporter are granted more lenient beatmap download limits.
