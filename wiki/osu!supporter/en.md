To get osu!supporter, sign in (or [register](/wiki/sign_up)), then go to the [store page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/supporter-tag). Use the slider or the month buttons (underneath the slider) to select the duration of the osu!supporter tag. A different duration will change the price you will pay. The currency used is in United States dollars (USD). If your country uses a different currency, please use a currency converter such as [OANDA](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/) or [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=usd+exchange+rate) to check the price. The prices displayed on the osu!store page are by per individual account.
