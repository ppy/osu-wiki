# Beatmap ranking procedure

*See also: [Rank (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Rank) and [Ranking queue](Ranking_queue)*
*For beatmap categories mentioned below, see: [Beatmap Category](/wiki/Beatmap/Category)*

[Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) can be promoted to the community by following the beatmap ranking procedure and entering the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) category.

## Feedback

A beatmap's creator can mark their submissions as `Work in Progress` or `Pending`. Beatmaps in both of these categories are intended to receive feedback from the osu! community.

[Modding](/wiki/Modding) is the process of receiving constructive criticism on a beatmap and is beneficial to improving its quality. Users ordinarily post feedback on a beatmap's [discussion page](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion) or discuss issues with the beatmap's creator directly.

Newer beatmappers usually need extensive modding to create beatmaps that meet the Ranked category's quality standards, and often they're required to recreate their beatmaps from scratch.

Before being nominated for ranking, a beatmap needs to receive [hype](/wiki/Beatmap/Hype) posts from at least five different users.

## Nominations {id=nominations}

:::

A **nomination** is a vote of approval, which indicates a beatmap's readiness to become [ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked). It is given to completed beatmaps of sufficient quality, as judged by the nominating user. As a minimum requirement, these beatmaps must follow the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) and have 5 or more [hypes](/wiki/Beatmap/Hype).

Nominations are given by [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) (*BN*), a group of experienced modders. Members of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (*NAT*) may also nominate beatmaps, however that is not their primary role.

It is recommended to receive mods before requesting nominations from BNs, however five hypes are the only pre-requisite.

## Qualification

Qualification is a process where beatmaps that receive enough nominations are moved to the [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified) beatmap category. Beatmaps with only one primary [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) among all [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap#difficulty) need two nominations for the primary game mode, while hybrid sets[^hybrid-sets] need two nominations for the main game mode[^main-game-mode] and one for each subsidiary one.

The [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified) category exists to provide beatmaps wider exposure to the osu! community with the hopes of discovering potential problems. This is the most common stage for beatmaps to receive wide support, feedback and sometimes meet [obstructions](#obstruction).

## Obstruction

During the Qualified stage, problems are hoped to be reported to members of the BN and NAT from a beatmap's discussion page. Unlike Pending beatmaps, Qualified beatmaps cannot be updated by their creators, so feedback can only be applied after requesting a [nomination reset](#nomination-resets).

### Nomination resets

Nominations can be reset when a beatmap is updated by its creator, or when a member of the BN or NAT finds a problem in a nominated beatmap. They can also be reset by members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) when the reason involves inappropriate content. If a beatmap is qualified when its nominations are reset, it will be *disqualified*(commonly abbreviated as *DQ*) and removed from the [ranking queue](Ranking_queue) back to Pending. All nominations from the beatmap will also be removed.

Nomination resets allow creator to make changes to the beatmap and then request a re-nomination. It also helps ensure that modders, BNs and NAT members check over the most up-to-date version of a beatmap before it enters the [ranking queue](Ranking_queue).

### Vetoes

Members of the BN and NAT occasionally [veto](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Veto) beatmaps they believe have quality issues that are unrelated to the Ranking Criteria.

[Beatmap veto](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Veto) allows a BN or NAT member to withhold a beatmap from ranking if they feel there are significant issues regarding beatmap quality which make it unfit for the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) section. It allows seeking further discussion or clarification over any kind of quality issues which they feel need to be addressed before the map can proceed with [Qualification](#qualification).

## Rank

When a beatmap stays in Qualified for at least 7 days without any open [Problems or Suggestions](/wiki/Modding#types-of-mod-posts), the [ranking queue](Ranking_queue) is able to move it to [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked). If it has been through disqualification and re-qualification, the time for it to move from Qualified to Ranked should be [recalculated](Ranking_queue#dq-and-re-qualification). Ranked beatmaps have [score leaderboards](/wiki/Ranking) and reward players with performance points.

Ranked beatmaps are only unranked under exceptional circumstances when issues are found shortly after they reach Ranked status.

## Notes

[^main-game-mode]: A beatmap's game mode is considered its "main" if it contains the most difficulties. In the event the amount of difficulties is the same between 2+ modes, the main game mode will be the one with the most difficulties mapped by the beatmap's host. If neither of those conditions are met, then the main game mode will be the one which gets nominated first.
[^hybrid-sets]: Hybrid sets are beatmaps with difficulties across multiple game modes.
