# Beatmap ranking procedure

[Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) can be promoted to the community by following the beatmap ranking procedure and entering the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked) category.

## Feedback

A beatmap's creator can mark their submissions as `Work in Progress` or `Pending`. Beatmaps in both of these categories are intended to receive feedback from the osu! community.

[Modding](/wiki/Modding) is the process of receiving constructive criticism on a beatmap and is beneficial to improving its quality. Users ordinarily post feedback on a beatmap's discussion page or discuss issues with the beatmap's creator directly.

Newer beatmappers usually need extensive modding to create beatmaps that meet the Ranked category's quality standards, and often they're required to recreate their beatmaps from scratch.

Before being nominated for ranking, beatmapsets need to receive [hype](/wiki/Glossary#hype) posts from at least five different users.

## Nominations

Members of the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) (*BNs*) are experienced modders who are capable of nominating beatmapsets for ranking. Their role is to ensure a beatmapset meets the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) as well as their own personal quality standards.

Members of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (*NAT*) may also nominate beatmaps, however that is not their primary role.

It is recommended to receive mods before requesting nominations from BNs, however five hypes are the only pre-requisite.

## Qualification

Beatmaps that receive two nominations are moved to the [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmaps#qualified) beatmap category for at least 7 days. Qualified beatmaps have score leaderboards, but do not reward players with [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points).

This beatmap category exists to provide beatmaps wider exposure to the osu! community with the hopes of discovering potential problems. Problems can be reported to members of the BN and NAT from a beatmap's discussion page. Unlike Pending beatmaps, Qualified beatmaps cannot be updated by their creators, so feedback can only be applied after requesting a [nomination reset](#nomination-resets).

### Moving to Ranked

Qualified beatmapsets are placed in a queue for ranking. 8 beatmapsets from each game mode are able to move from Qualified to Ranked, so long as they have been in the queue for at least 7 days. This results in some beatmapsets remaining qualified for slightly longer than 7 days.

When a beatmapset is disqualified, its position in the ranking queue is saved. If it is re-qualified, it will be placed in its previous position in the ranking queue. For example, if a beatmapset is qualified for 2 days, then disqualified and re-qualified, it will remain in the Qualified category for approximately 5 more days. If the saved queue position is less than 24 hours away from Ranked, it will be reset to 24 hours upon entering Qualified.

## Nomination resets

Nomination resets help ensure that modders, BNs and NAT members check over the most up-to-date version of a beatmapset before it enters the ranking queue.

Nominations can be reset when a beatmapset's creator updates the set or when a member of the BN or NAT finds a problem in a nominated beatmapset. They can also be reset by members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) when the reason involves inappropriate content. If a beatmapset is qualified when its nominations are reset, the set will be disqualified, removing it from the ranking queue.

Members of the BN and NAT occasionally [veto](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Veto) beatmapsets they believe have quality issues that are unrelated to the Ranking Criteria.

## Ranked

Beatmapsets that have passed through the qualification stage have completed the ranking procedure. They have score leaderboards and reward players with performance points.

Ranked beatmaps are only unranked under exceptional circumstances when issues are found shortly after they reach Ranked status.
