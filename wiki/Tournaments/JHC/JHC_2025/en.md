## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The Jack House Cup 2025 is a team–based 1 versus 1 double-elimination team tournament, played on the osu!mania game mode (4K variant).
2. Beatmap scoring is based on ScoreV2.
3. The size for a team is 1–2 players.
4. The mappool for each round will be announced by the mappool selectors on the main stage, in 1 week before the matches take place.
5. The match schedules for each round will be announced by the tournament managers on this page, as well as the information sheet, in 1 week before the matches take place.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins is allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay elements or mechanics in unintended ways.
7. If no players are present at the match time, the match can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If after this period there are still no players for either team, a *win by default* will be declared for the side with a member present; if after this period there are still no players for both teams, a *win by default* will be declared for the team with higher seed in qualifiers.
   - The minimum amount of required players is the amount of players needed to play a beatmap without any vacant spots in the lobby (i.e. at least 1 participant from each team must be present for the match to begin).
8. There is no warm-up stage in the match.
9. Exchanging players between games is allowed without limitations.
10. If a game ends in a draw, it will be nullified and the beatmap will be replayed.
11. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical issues while playing within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap drain length (whichever happens first) of the game's start. Referees may, at their discretion, veto this request.
    - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to rematch a beatmap.
    - The roster for each team during a rematch must remain the same as the original run. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue that prevents a player from entering the lobby, both teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
    - This rule is not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
12. If a player disconnects mid-game, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total, unless adequate proof of said score is provided. The following are considered as acceptable proof:
    - Player point-of-view live stream snippets (commonly referred to as "clips" or "VODs"). The entirety of the play, along with the results screen must be clearly visible along with the affected player's score.
    - Replay files of the play, taken directly from the "Local scores" tab on the affected player's client (the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place, as seen on the multiplayer lobby link).
    - Screenshots from other players taken directly in-game that show the affected player's score.
      - Screenshots from the results screen must clearly show the affected player's score. This is the preferred method.
      - Screenshots taken in-game at the time of disconnection may be accepted. Note that this method does not provide a one-to-one representation of that player's score. Using this method is not encouraged and it may be denied at the referee's discretion if the information provided is not sufficient to identify the player/score.
      - All screenshots **MUST** be taken using the game itself (using `Shift` + `F12`), that is, they must be hosted on the `https://osu.ppy.sh/` domain. Any other form of screenshot will be denied.
    - Player scores may be derived from the official stream as a last resort, in cases where the match is streamed.
13. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied by the tournament managers. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, and other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly.
14. Any attempts to manipulate bracket outcomes or future matchups may result in the immediate disqualification of the player or team from the competition. Examples of manipulative behavior include, but are not limited to:
    - Colluding with other players or teams to force a desired matchup.
    - Deliberately playing poorly to lose a game or match.
    - Forfeiting bracket matches without providing an adequate reasoning, or with the intention of getting a more favourable matchup.
15. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions from the referees and the tournament managers are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be objected.
16. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms where the matches will take place.
    - Breaking the chat rules may result in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate in multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the duration of the punishment.
17. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap.
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match.
    - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other team.
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
    - Disqualification from the current and future Jack House Cup tournaments, until appealed.
18. Referees may allow, at their discretion, lower or higher tolerances for timers.
19. The tournament managers may request liveplays or recordings of individual players or teams at any point in the tournament without prior warning.
20. Any tournament-related complaints shall be sent to the [osu! tournament report form](https://tcomm.hivie.tn/reports/create).
21. The tournament managers reserve the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.

   - Player **must** join this [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DqPuRU8Bhc) or this [QQ group](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?_wv=1027&k=pRNiqDnTUmLKQgy8iy2LnLx3uTYIL0dG) after registering.
2. To ensure valid registrations, a list of every participant will be sent for [tournament screening](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#tournament-screening).
   - Players must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months.
3. A list of all successfully registered players will be published after registration.
4. [Tournament staff members](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#staff) and the members of the winner team in JHC2024 must not participate as players in the tournament.

### Qualifier instructions

1. In the Qualifier stage, all teams will play a specific pool designed by the mappool selectors.
2. The Qualifier pool contains 7 maps, all of which will use [Free Mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#free-mod) rules.
3. Players will play the mappool at least once (and up to twice) at a designated time. Their best combined score will be the final result.
4. The mappool will be played in order of the stage numbers. Players may not ask to play the pool in any other order.
   - Teams may skip playing any beatmap on their second run.
5. For each map, each team must have **only 1 member** to play. They may be exchanged freely after a map is concluded.
6. An optional 5-minute break will be offered between the first and second playthroughs of the mappool.
7. All teams will play their qualifiers in separate rooms.
   - It is *suggested* that teams do not broadcast or share their results publicly to avoid seed manipulation.
8. The seeding method used for Qualifiers will be rank sum, where each team's map rank will be added together to compose that team's final score, which is then sorted from lowest to highest, lowest being seed #1.
9. The top 32 seeded teams will advance to the Round of 32.

### Win conditions

1. In the Qualifiers, teams need to place in the top 48 seeded teams in order to advance to the double-elimination stage.
2. In the Round of 32 and Round of 16, teams need to win 5 maps to win a match (best of 9).
3. In the Quarterfinals and Semifinals, teams need to win 6 maps to win a match (best of 11).
4. In the Finals and Grand Finals, teams need to win 7 maps to win the match (best of 13).

### Match instructions

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room 15 minutes before the scheduled match time. Teams must join the lobby in that period.
   - The room settings are `Game mode: "osu!mania"`, `Team mode: "Team Vs"` and `Score mode: "ScoreV2"`. The room name must follow the pattern of `JHC2025: ({Red Team}) VS ({Blue Team})`. The team mentioned first in the room name must be the red team, the team mentioned second in the room name must be the blue team.
   - If the team name is too long or contains illegal characters such that the room cannot be created, it may be considered to shorten or change the team name.
2. Each captain must use `!roll` once in `#multiplayer`. After the rolls are set, the pick and ban phase will have the following steps:
   1. The winner of the !roll starts protecting one beatmap, followed by the loser of the !roll to protect a beatmap. They may not protect the same beatmap. Protected beatmaps may not be banned.
   2. The loser of the !roll starts banning one beatmap, followed by the winner of the !roll to ban a beatmap.
   3. The winner of the !roll starts picking the first beatmap of the match.
3. After bans are decided, both teams will take turns in picking a beatmap from the mappool.
4. Teams will be allowed 2 minutes and 30 seconds to pick a beatmap and then 2 minutes and 30 seconds to press the `Ready` button on their client. If a team takes more time than allowed, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
   - For the first occurrence:
     - The team will receive a verbal warning from the referee.
   - On subsequent occurrences:
     - For map bans, the team forfeits the ban.
     - For map picks, a random map will be chosen from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of maps that were neither picked nor banned, excluding the tiebreaker.
     - For a ready timer, the referee will issue the `!mp start 10` command, regardless of how many players from each team are present in the lobby, using `!mp kick` on any extra players for each team, starting from the top (i.e. the first valid player combination for each team will be forced to play the pick). The results for such games are to be taken as is.
     - Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from staffs.
5. Each team will receive one "tactical timeout" of 2 minutes and 30 seconds, to be used as extra time to ban, pick, or ready for a beatmap. *The tactical timeout is optional.*
   - The tactical timeout may be called on a tiebreaker, provided that both teams agree to it.

### Mappool instructions

1. Every stage will have its own mappool.
2. Each mappool consists of a fixed amount of maps for each stage, all of which will be played under [Free Mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#free-mod) conditions.
3. The mappool sizes are as follows:
   - Qualifiers: 7 beatmaps
   - Round of 32 and Round of 16: 13 beatmaps
   - Quarterfinals and Semifinals: 15 beatmaps
   - Finals and Grand Finals: 17 beatmaps
4. Each mappool has one tiebreaker, except for the Qualifiers.
5. Possible mod choices for the Free Mod bracket are `No Fail`, `Hidden`, `Fade In`, `Flashlight`, and `Mirror`.
6. The tiebreaker will be played under Free Mod conditions.
