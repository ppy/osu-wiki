## Participants

 *Participants will be announced soon after the screening phase has ended.*

## Mappools

 *Every mappool will be announced 7 days (usually Sunday) before the next stage's match timeline.*

## Ruleset

### General rules

1. This tournament is a **1v1 double-elimination tournament**.
2. Players will first go through Qualifiers, then continuing to the double-elimination bracket.
3. Any player is allowed to sign up due to no rank limit.
4. Any members of staff **apart from organisers, mappool selectors, and referees** are allowed to play.
5. Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely.
6. Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

### Mappool format

The maps in this tournament will only consist of Long Note (LN) oriented maps, and cover 4 sub-categories of LNs which are used to categorise all mappools after this stage. See the graphics below for more information!

### Stage regulations

#### Qualifiers

1. after the screening phase has concluded, players eligible to play will participate in tournament play.
2. In the first weekend, players will play 4 qualifiers maps in sequence up to 2 times, in a scheduled lobby (they may choose not to play the 2nd time if desired).

##### Qualifiers mappool details

1. The 4 qualifiers maps will cover 4 sub-categories of LNs which are used to categorise all mappools after this stage:
   - Stage 1: Coordination
   - Stage 2: Technical
   - Stage 3: Wildcard
   - Stage 4: Density

##### Seeding calculation

1. After completing the scheduled lobby, each player will have 1 - 2 scored recorded for each of the 4 qualifiers maps. **For each of the maps, the higher score of the two is taken** and is used to not only cut down to a pre-decided number of players that will advance to the next stage, but also determine each player's "seed".
2. A player's "seed" is determined by where their scored for each map stands relative to the other participants. Essentially, a player receives a higher score rating for 1 qualifier map if they perform better at it relative to other participants, and vice versa. This score rating is **averaged for all 4 maps**. Thus, a player **with higher score will receive a higher "seed"**. The top 64 players in terms of score rating will move on to the Bracket Elimination stage, and every other player is eliminated from the tournament.

##### Bracket Matches

After Qualifier Stage, every remaining player will be arranged into a standard Double Elimination Bracket, where the highest seeded player will face the lowest seeded player, 2nd highest faces 2nd lowest, and so on. Each player must lose 2 different matches to be eliminated from the tournament.

### Tournament Procedure

#### Pre-match procedure

1. Players will be informed of their match by an assigned referee 30 minutes before their matches commence, through a ping on Discord.
2. 30 minutes before the match commences, both players will also be allowed to provide a warmup map **(it must be uploaded on the osu! forum, safe for work, and less than 4:00 long** which will be played before the [Mid-match procedure](#mid-match-procedure). Players are allowed to skip their own warmup if desired.
3. Players will be provided with an invite to the lobby hosted by the referee 5 minutes before their match commences. Players are required to be p resent in the lobby before the stipulated match time.
4. When both players are present in the lobby, the match will begin with each player playing their selected warmup (if any).

#### Mid-match procedure

1. After warmups, both players will run the `!roll` command in the lobby chat. The player with the higher roll will be able to **choose whether to protect, ban, and pick first or second**. The player with the lower roll receives the opposite of this.
2. Following the ban/pick procedure, both players will alternate in picks, and play the picked map simultaneously. The player who obtains a higher score will win a point, and this process repeats until one of the players wins the required number of points to claim the win for the match. The required number of points to win the match varies for each stage.
3. In the event where both players are 1 point away from winning the match, the tiebraeker will be played, and the player who wins the tiebreaker map will win the match.
4. Should there be a tie in map score between the 2 players, the result will be nullified and the map will be played once more to determine who gets the point.

### Additional rules/information

#### Mod configurations

1. The score system used for all matches in this tournament will be **Score V2**.
2. All maps are played with FreeMod. Visual mods such as Mirror, Hidden, Fade-In, Flashlight, and any combination of these mods are allowed. You are also allowed, but not forced, to play with NoFail.

#### Punctuality

1. Players are required to arrive for their match before the stipulated time for their match. Otherwise, a **10 minute** grace timer will be applied by the appointed referee for the match.
2. If the player fails to arrive at their match before this timer runs out, the match will be considered as a win by default to the other player.
3. If the player arrives at their match during this grace period, the time remaining on the timer will be brought forward to the ban/pick proceeding of the match.

#### Ban/Pick procedures

1. Players will be given 3 minutes to roll and perform their first ban/picks. Subsequently, players will have 2 minutes to pick a map and get ready to play the map.
   - If a player fails to adhere to the timer to ban/pick, the referee will choose a map by random to be picked in place of the player, using the `!roll` command
   - On the second and subsequent occurrences, a point will be automatically awarded to the other player.

#### Disconnection

1. If a player is disconnected from a map within the first 30 seconds of gameplay, they can ask for the map to be aborted and replayed. This is only available once per match for each player; Subsequent disconnects will give a point to the opponent and use up the remainder of the 10 minute grace period.
2. If a player disconnects after the first 30 seconds of gameplay, 1 point will be awarded to the other player.
3. In the event a player is unable to return to the lobby before the grace period ends, the match will be considered a win to the other player.
4. In the event both players are disconnected, the player whose grace period runs out first will concede the match to the opponent.
5. In the event both players run out of grace period simultaneously, the winner will be the player with the higher qualifier seed.

#### Player conduct

Please treat all Players and Staff Members with basic decency. Any conflict will be treated case by case, and in the event a player or staff member is found to have conducted themselves inappropriately towards anyone in the server, **said individual can be subject to timeouts, warnings and bans from the tournament and its affiliated twitch channel based on the severity of the incident**.
