## Ruleset

### Tournament Rules

1. The osu!mania 7K World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu!mania game mode.
     - **While this competition is planned as a 2 versus 2 setup, this might change depending on the amount of incoming registrations.**
2. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the Map Selector in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
    - The Group Stage mappool will be announced after the drawings.
    - One beatmap will be given as a tiebreaker beatmap. This beatmap will only be played in case of a tie.
4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
    - Reviving and surviving during a beatmap is considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
    - If a game is nullified the beatmap will be replayed.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the beatmap.
    - Disconnects within 30 seconds after beatmap begin can be rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.
    - **If a rematch happens, the roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible (the player who got disconnected can't get back in time) then both teams are allowed to swap rosters.**
10. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. **The size of each team is restricted to a maximum of 4 players and a minimum of 2.**
    - This might change depending on the amount of registrations.
12. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
13. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
