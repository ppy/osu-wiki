## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The Lazer Grand Arena is a multi-bracket (single, and later double elimination) tournament, played on osu!(lazer), osu! ruleset.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on the default osu!(lazer) scoring.
3. The mappool for each stage will be announced by the mappool selectors on the official stream at appropriate times.
4. The match schedules for each stage will be announced by the tournament managers on this page, as well as the information spreadsheet, on the Sunday before the matches take place.
5. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins is allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay elements or mechanics in unintended ways.
6. If either player is not present at match time, the match can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If after this period either player is not present, a *win by default* will be declared for the other player. If neither player is present, the match will be nullified and the player who was slated to play against the winner of this match will receive one bye.
7. Players may ask for a rematch if they encounter technical issues while playing within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap drain length (whichever happens first) of the game's start. Referees may, at their discretion, veto this request.
   - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to rematch a beatmap.
   - This rule is not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
8. If a player disconnects mid-game, their score will not be counted towards their cumulative, unless adequate proof of said score is provided. The following are considered as acceptable proof:
   - Player point-of-view live stream snippets (commonly referred to as "clips" or "VODs"). The entirety of the play, along with the results screen must be clearly visible along with the affected player's score.
   - Replay files of the play, taken directly from the "Local scores" tab on the affected player's client (the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place, as seen on the multiplayer lobby link).
   - Player scores may be derived from the official stream as a last resort, in cases where the match is streamed.
9. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied by the tournament managers. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, and other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly.
10. Any attempts to manipulate bracket outcomes or future matchups may result in the immediate disqualification of the player from the competition. Examples of manipulative behavior include, but are not limited to:
    - Deliberately playing poorly to lose a game or match.
    - Colluding with other players to force a desired matchup.
    - Forfeiting bracket matches without providing an adequate reasoning, or with the intention of getting a more favourable matchup.
11. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions from the referees and the tournament managers are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be objected.
12. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms where the matches will take place.
    - Breaking the chat rules may result in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate in multiplayer matches for the duration of the punishment and, as a result, can have their match forfeited.
13. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
    - Removal of pick rights for a game or match.
    - Point deductions.
    - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other player.
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments, until appealed.
14. Referees may allow, at their discretion, lower or higher tolerances for timers.
15. The tournament managers may request liveplays or recordings of individual players at any point in the tournament without prior warning.
16. The tournament managers will be responsible for receiving and investigating any tournament-related complaints.
17. The tournament managers reserve the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.

### Tournament registration

1. Every user interested in playing will be be required to sign up by playing in the official Qualifier playlist. Completing every map of the playlist is *required* to be considered for seeding.
2. To ensure valid registrations, every qualifying participant will be manually checked by the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team), in a manner similar to the [tournament screening](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#tournament-screening) that is offered to community tournaments. To be successfully accepted on the tournament, players are required to not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months.
3. Participants will be briefed on further steps via an announcement message on the website.
4. Tournament staff members are **not** allowed to play in the tournament, with the exception of commentators, statisticians, and streamers.
   - The tournament managers must ensure that such staff members do not have access to priviledged information, e.g. Qualifiers score information, mappool information before the mappool showcase, etc. They are to be treated as regular players whenever possible.

### Qualifier information

1. In the Qualifier stage, all players will play a specific pool designed by the mappool selectors.
2. The mappool will contain 5 brackets: No Mod, [Hidden](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hidden), [Hard Rock](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hard_Rock), [Double Time](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Double_Time), and [Lazer Mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier_(lazer)).

4. Players will participate in an osu!(lazer) playlist lobby, which can be completed anywhere from **Sunday, May 4 19:00 UTC** to **Sunday, May 11 19:00 UTC**.
   - The playlist to be played is titled `Lazer Grand Arena 2025 - Qualifiers`, hosted by [LeoFLT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3668779).
   - *Notice: the playlist **closes** on May 11, 19:00 UTC, at which point no new scores will be allowed. No exceptions will be made.*
5. Players will have **18 tries** to use across the **12 playlist entries**, with no restrictions on the order of play or amount of tries per individual item.
   - To be eligible for seeding, every player must submit ***at least*** one score for every beatmap listed.
6. Only the player's best attempt (i.e. highest score) will be used for every beatmap listed.
7. The lowest score across the 12 beatmaps will be removed from each player's seeding calculations.
8. The seeding method used for Qualifiers will be %MAX â€” the highest score for each map will receive 100% of the points, and every other player will be awarded a percentage of that top score. The exact formula that will be used for all players (and for each map) is `Final Score = Player Score / MAX Score`, where:
   - `Final Score` is the percentage awarded to the current player
   - `Player Score` is the score the current player achieved on the current map
   - `MAX Score` is the highest score achieved for the current map
9. The top 32 seeded players will advance to the bracket stage.

### Bracket stage information

1. Matches for this stage of the tournament will have players play maps in sets of two, with the cumulative score across both maps determining the winner of the set. The first player to score to 3 wins the match (best of 5). In the event of a 2-2 tie, the last set will also feature an osu! original (**OG**) pick, to be played after the regular set picks.
2. The osu! original pick is to be played under FreeMod conditions. **The only mods allowed for this purpose are any combination of No Mod, [Hidden](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hidden), and [Hard Rock](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Hard_Rock)**.  
3. The draft order will be composed of a ban/protect phase and a pick/play phase.
4. The ban/protect phase will start with the lower seeded player banning one map, followed by the higher seeded player banning one map. Afterwards, the lower seeded player will protect one map, followed by the higher seeded player protecting one map. Lastly, the lower seeded player will once again ban a map, followed by the higher seeded player banning a final map.
   - Protected maps may only be picked by the player who protected them, and may not be banned.
5. After the ban/protect phase, players will take turns picking maps from the available pool, following the ABBA order, starting with the higher seedeed player.
6. The bracket stage will have two phases (one per weekend):
   - For the first weekend, a single-elimination bracket will be played from the Round of 32 up until the Quarterfinals.
   - For the second weekend, a double-elimination bracket will be played, from Quarterfinals up until the Grand Finals.
7. All matches for each weekend will utilise the same mappool.
   - Each pool will feature 15 maps, organised as such:
     - No Mod: 4 beatmaps
     - Hidden: 3 beatmaps
     - Hard Rock: 3 beatmaps
     - Double Time: 3 beatmaps
     - Lazer Mod: 1 beatmap
     - Original: 1 beatmap

### Win conditions

- In the Qualifiers, players need to place in the top 32 in order to advance to the single-elimination bracket stage.
  - Seeding for this stage will follow the %MAX format â€” the highest score for each map will receive 100% of the points (i.e. 1 point), and every other player will be awarded a percentage of that top score. The sum of the highest score for every map will be used as the final seeding, with a higher point sum meaning higher placement (i.e. sorted in descending order).
    - The exact formula that will be used for all players (and for each map) is `Final Score = Player Map Score / MAX Score`, where:
      - `Final Score` is the numerical value awarded to the current player for each map.
      - `Player Map Score` is the score the player being evaluated achieved on the current map, taking the best score out of two.
      - `MAX Score` is the highest score achieved for the current map across all players and all runs.
- For the bracket stage, maps will be played in sets of two, and the player with the highest cumulative score for each set wins a point. The first player to win 3 sets wins the match (best of 5).

### Match procedures

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room 10 minutes before the scheduled match time. Players must join the lobby in that period.
   - The room settings are `Ruleset: "osu!"` and `Game type: "Team Vs"`. The room name must follow the pattern of `LGA2025: ({High seed}) VS ({Low seed})`. The player mentioned first in the room name must be the High seed, and the player mentioned second in the room name must be the Low seed.
2. Each player will receive one "tactical timeout" of 2 minutes, to be used as extra time to ban, pick, or ready for a beatmap. The tactical timeout may not be called on the opposing player's pick or ban phase.
3. Players will be allowed 2 minutes for each pick/ban phase (as described on the [bracket stage instructions](#bracket-stage-information) section), and an additional 2 minutes to press the `Ready` button on their client before play commences. If a player takes more time than allotted for either action, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
   - For the first occurrence:
     - The player will receive a verbal warning from the referee; in addition, the referee may opt to forcefully use the player's tactical timeout to allow for the player to pick.
     - If the player does not pick a map within 15 seconds from when the timer expires, the referee will apply the procedure for subsequent occurrences listed below, i.e. a random pick will be used for a pick timer, and the match will be forcefully started for a ready timer.
   - On subsequent occurrences:
     - For a pick timer: a random map will be chosen from the mappool by rolling a random number, based on the amount of beatmaps that were neither picked nor banned.
     - For a ready timer: the referee will issue the start command on a 10-second countdown. In this scenario, if the referee starts the match and either player is not present in the lobby, their opponent will receive the point instead.
     - Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from the tournament managers.
