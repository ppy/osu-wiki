## Ruleset
### General Rules

1. Taiko LMS: Shift Cup is a 3v3 team tournament, with the aspects of knock-out rules, and double elimination bracket.

2. The mapsets for each round will be announced by the map selectors in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place.
3. Participants must be between Rank **\#75** and **\#5,000** Global.
4. Map scoring is based on **Score V2.**
5. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management.

7. Usage of the Visual Settings options are allowed.
8. If the game ends in a draw, the tiebreaker will be played.
9. If a player disconnects, their score is treated as being 0.
   - Unless the disconnected player has a screenshot with their final score, or the server saved their score before disconnection, so we can compare it to the others.
   - The second exception is when the player is disconnected in first ten seconds of a map. In that case, there will be a rematch. This may only occur once per map, and once per player.
10. Maps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. If less than 3 players attend, your Revives will be limited by 1 less, per the round.
12. The Revive System functions are as follows:
    - You can only revive **other** eliminated members of your team. Not yourself.
    - You may not choose to revive yourself if playing as the last member (1 vs 3, for example).
    - Players may swap freely between each other for each map.
    - More information to the Revive system are in [Stage Instructions](#stage-instructions) and [Match Instructions](#match-instructions).

    - During Round of 16 and Quarterfinals, each team is given 2 Revives.
    - During and after Semifinals, each team is given 3 Revives.
      - If a player loses a map they are knocked out and cannot participate in the same match unless revived.
      - The player who is revived may not participate in the match on the same turn they are revived, except in the instance that the team waits to use their revives after all players have been eliminated.
      - Each player may only be revived once per match.
      - _**Elimination Stages Only**_: Revives may only occur **after** that round's map has been chosen.
14. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a map.
15. Unexpected incidents are handled by tournament management.
16. Any modification of these rules will be announced.

### Tournament Registration

1. Your team needs at least 3 players to participate.
   - The maximum size of a team is 4 players.

   - You must specify a captain who will represent a team.
   - Every player will be informed via PM about the team registration. Don't register teams without aggrement from all players!

2. The Tournament Team involved directly with the map pool may not participate as players in this tournament. This does not include referees, streamers and commentators.
3. The maximum amount of teams is 32.

   - If less than 32 teams arrive, the grouping will be set up differently.

3. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:
   - More Matches Won.

   - Most maps won.
4. The top 2 teams of each group will move on to the Knock-Out Stages. (depending on the grouping).
5. Following stages are Knock-Out Stages. This means that the winner moves to the next stage and the losing team gets put into the loser brackets.
6. Winning condition: In all rounds, you need to knockout all players from the opponent team. The lowest scoring player of every played map gets knocked out from the match. The team that loses all players after consuming all Revives first loses the match.
   - Revive distribution is handled according to point 11 on [General Rules](#general-rules).

### Match Instructions

   - The room will be locked. The password and multiplayer invite will be sent to the two captains as soon as possible.
   - Captains **must specify the three members** who will participate in the match before rolls. Team Size is 4, so choose 3, one must sit out. This is to ensure that teams have a back-up player, in case of emergency or sickness.

   - Offensive songs may be blocked by referees.
3. Map selection will alternate between each captain selecting a map out of the map pool. Each captain must use "!roll" once in #multiplayer to determine which team selects and bans first. Roll winner may decide if they want to ban first and pick 2nd, or pick first and ban 2nd. Bans always happen before picks.
   - Each team is allowed to ban one map out of the entire map pool with the exception of the tiebreaker, which cannot be banned. Each team has to use their ban.
