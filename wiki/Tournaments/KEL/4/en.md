## Ruleset

### General information

1. KEL4 is a 1v1 multi-bracket LAN tournament (single, later double elimination) played within the osu! stable client.
2. All matches will be played with ScoreV2 in Head-to-Head mode.
3. All maps will be played with No Fail enabled, along with the appropriate mods for that map.
4. Each stage's mappool will be revealed during the official tournament stream.
5. Special guests will be undergoing a special qualifying process separate from the normal players. Their results will be revealed once all qualifying lobbies have concluded.
5. Tournament staff members are not allowed to participate as players, with the exception of commentators and GFX artists.

### Qualifier procedure

1. Players must select a lobby from the sign-up spreadsheet. Lobbies are open to anyone as long as there's an empty slot.
   - Players must notify hosts of their lobby choice in the Discord channel using the pinned prompt.
2.The final Qualifier lobby must begin no later than TBA.
3. If a player does not show up to their scheduled Qualifiers lobby, they may play in any other lobby.
4. Maps will be played in the listed order as shown on the mappool sheet. There will be one playthrough of the pool. If a player wishes to re-play the pool, they will be able to do so once. Only best runs will be used for seeding.
5. Players have 120 seconds to ready up before each map.
6. The top # players, determined by the avg sum of placements, will advance to the Bracket Stage.

### Mappool information

1. There will be a total of 3 mappools.
2. The mappools will be sized as follows:
   - Qualifiers: 10 beatmaps
   - RO32 and RO16: 14 beatmaps
   - Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals: 18 beatmaps
3. Each mappool will consist of 4 brackets: No Mod, Hidden, Hard Rock and Double Time.
4. Each bracket will be played with the respective mods enabled for all players.
5. The tiebreaker will be played under Free Mod conditions, with no mods enforced.

### Bracket stage procedure

1. Brackets RO32 and RO16 are single elimination.
2. Brackets QF, Finals, SF and GF are double elimination.
3. No warmup maps are allowed.
4. No restrictions for picks or bans.
5. No Fail is enforced on all maps.
6. Players will `!roll` in matches. The winner may choose between a pick or ban order, and the other player may choose the remaining order.
7. Players have 1 ban from Round of 32 to Round of 16 and 2 bans throughout the rest of bracket stage.
   - Ban order is ABBA, and all bans must happen at the start of the match.
8. Players will be allowed 120 seconds to either pick or ban and 120 seconds to ready up. If a player takes more time than allotted for any of the above actions, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
   - First occurrence:
      -    A 30-second extension is given along with a verbal warning.
If a player does not pick a map within 15 seconds from when the timer expires, the referee will apply the procedure for subsequent occurrences listed below, i.e. a random pick will be used for a pick timer, and the match will be forcefully started for a ready timer.
   - On subsequent occurrences:
For a pick timer: A random map will be chosen from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of beatmaps remaining in the mappool, excluding the tiebreaker.
For a ready timer: the referee will issue the `!mp start 10` command.
Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from the tournament hosts.
9. Players get one timeout of 2 minutes per match. Both players and the referee must be in agreement when extending a timeout or having another timeout.

### Disconnections

1. In the event of a disconnection, an abort/replay may be called if it occurred within the first 30 seconds of the map. Other than that, common sense will be applied. If proof exists of the disconnected player's score, it can be used. If it is at all ambiguous, the player's score is considered void.
2. Disconnections are considered to be unexpected, game-breaking events out of a player's control (i.e. keyboard/tablet/mouse/driver malfunction, system failure, internet disconnect, etc). Offset, background dim, leaderboard presence, etc. ARE NOT considered valid reasons to call for an abort/replay as players should fix these on their own.
