## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The osu!taiko World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu!taiko game mode.
   - **While this competition is planned as a 2 versus 2 setup, this might change depending on the amount of incoming registrations.**
2. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
3. The maps for each round will be announced by the mapset selector on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
   - One map will be given as a tiebreaker map. This map will only be played in case of a tie.
   - There will also be a [Hidden](/wiki/Game_Modifiers), [HardRock](/wiki/Game_Modifiers), [DoubleTime](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) and FreeMod bracket.
4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see above).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a map gets considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable map elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
   - If a game is nullified the beatmap will be replayed.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
   - Disconnects within the first 30 seconds of a beatmap can be rematched at the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.
   - **If a rematch happens, the roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible (the player who got disconnected can't get back in time) then both teams are allowed to swap rosters.**
10. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
    - If a team having the minimum required players online only presents 2 players in the lobby after the scheduled start time, they will forfeit their warmup.
12. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
13. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
14. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluent and without delays. Excessive match delays coming from the player's side can be issued with penalties.
15. If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team can not provide an exchange, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum.

19. In Group stage, 'Win by default' will be considered as win by 4:0, +1.0 score difference ratio.
