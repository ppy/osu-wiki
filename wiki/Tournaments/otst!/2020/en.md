2. Each member of the team must be in the Discord server to verify their participation.
3. If a player changes their name, they (or a team captain) needs to inform the manager as soon as possible to avoid misunderstandings in a match.
4. If a player exhibits suspicious behavior, including but not limited to suspected multi-accounting or cheating, their participation in the tournament might be prohibited, subject to tournament host discretion.
5. Accounts that were recently unbanned or suspended within 12 months prior to signups will not be allowed to participate in otst!.

### Scheduling

1. **All times in the scheduled are in UTC.**
2. Scheduling will be based on team timezones to avoid as many no-shows as possible.
3. If any team wants to reschedule a match, please have the requesting and the opposing team agree on the new time and have either team captain submit proof of agreement in `#reschedule` text channel on otst!'s Discord server by **Thursday 23:59 UTC**.
4. All matches must be 4v4s
5. If a team are certain that its team cannot make it to a match even after a reschedule, please tell the manager or their referee and we will give them a loss for that match
   - Failure to do so will result in a penalty and teams may be exempt from future iterations or tournaments hosted by Seaweed.

### Match proceedings

1. Referees have the final decision in all matches so please respect their choices, but do not forget that they are human too and any disrespect **will** result in penalties.
2. At the time of the match, referees will invite the captain into the lobby. If for any reason the team captain cannot make it to a match, please have a team member inform a referee before the match starts.
3. If a team is not present for the match 10 minutes after the scheduled time, that team will forfeit the match. If neither team makes it, `!roll` by the referee will determine who wins or loses.
4. At the start of the match, both captains will `!roll`. The higher roll gets second ban and first pick. Warmups may either be chosen by roll or another method decided in the lobby.
   - Warmups are strictly limited to 2 minutes maximum drain time.

   - Players may combine mods (eg. HDHR)
8. NoFail is forced starting from RO32
9. Team captains must `!roll` again at the start of the tiebreaker; highest roll will decide which TB map to play first.
   - Players are allowed, however not required, to use mods in the tiebreaker bracket.
