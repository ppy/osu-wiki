## Ruleset
### Tournament Rules

1. The osu!catch World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu!catch game mode.
  - While this competition is planned as a 3 versus 3 setup, this might change depending on the amount of incoming registrations.

2. Map scoring is based on Score V2.
  - Changes to the Score V2 algorithm were proposed by the Tournament Management to the developers already and are yet under review.

3. The maps for each round will be announced by the mapset selector in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
  - One map will be given as a tiebreaker map. This map will only be played in case of a tie.
  - There will also be a [Hidden](/wiki/Game_Modifiers), [HardRock](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) and a [DoubleTime](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) bracket.

4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
  - Reviving and surviving during a map gets considered as passing it.

7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable map elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
  - Disconnects within 30 seconds after map begin can be rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.

10. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
12. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
13. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
14. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluent and without delays. Excessive match delays coming from the player's side can be issued with penalties.
15. If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team can not provide an exchange, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum.
16. All players and referees must to be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and tournament management is to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
17. Disrupting the match by foul play, picking inappropriate warmup maps (see below), insulting and provoking other players or referees, delaying the match or other deliberate inappropriate misbehavior is strictly prohibited.
18. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms, too.
  - Breaking the chat rules results in a silence. Silenced players can not participate at multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.

19. In Group stage, 'Win by default' will be considered as win by 4:0, +1.0 score difference ratio.
20. Unexpected incidences are handled by the tournament management. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
21. Penalties for violating the tournament rules can be:
  - Exclusion of specific players for one map
  - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match
  - Declaring the match as Lost by Default
  - Disqualification from the entire tournament
  - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments until appealed
  - Any modification of these rules will be announced.

### Tournament Registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team signs up individually.
  - Tournament Management will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
  - Tournament Management declares one candidate to the captain of the country's team, albeit temporarily.
  - The declared captain can form their team from the candidate list of their country.

2. To ensure valid and serious registrations, every registered user will be checked by the Tournament Management.
  - Every registered user will be assigned to their respective country's candidate list.
  - To be successfully accepted on the list, you have to ensure that your global osu!catch performance ranking is above 5000.
  - To be successfully accepted on the list, you have to ensure that you did not violate the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months.

3. All successfully formed teams will be published after the Registration Phase.
4. Only the 32 potentially strongest countries will participate. The potential strength of a country is determined by the online statistics of all valid candidates.
  - If the amount of registered countries is below 32, the number might be reduced to 24, 20 or 16. The aim is always to let as many countries participate as possible!

5. Mapset selectors may not participate as a player in this tournament.

### Stage Instructions

  - This may change depending on how many teams are accepted into the competition at the end.
