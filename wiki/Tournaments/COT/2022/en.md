## Ruleset

### General rules

1. Map scoring is based on **[ScoreV2](/wiki/Gameplay/Score#scorev2).**
2. The match lobby will be created by the referee, and the players will be invited.
3. Players have a strict 10-minute grace period available to play the match. If 10 minutes pass and a player does not show up the match, the other player will receive a win by default.
4. Warmups are not allowed.
5. It is not allowed to show any form of harassment in a livestreamed lobby. As per staff decision, a player may be disqualified for breaking this rule.
6. At the start of the match, both players `!roll`. The roll winner decides who gets to ban or pick first.
7. The referee is not allowed to play in the match, which means the referee should not be in the lobby during the match process.
8. Each player is allowed 1 or 2 bans per match. Banned maps are removed from the mappool for the duration of the match and are not allowed to be picked. A player is not allowed to ban 2 maps from the same mod pool.
9. Players have 2 minutes to select a map; if they fail to choose in the allotted time, the map choice will be random.
10. Each player may use a tactical 2-minute timeout once during the tournament. The tactical timeout is optional.
11. After choosing a map, players have 2 minutes to prepare. A referee will start the the timer when both players are ready.
12. NoFail is forced on every map.
13. If a player disconnects during the first 30 seconds of the match, it will be replayed. If the disconnect happened after 30 seconds, then the disconnected player's score will not count.

### Qualifiers

1. All the rules found above will be in effect during the qualifier lobbies. Qualifier lobbies will be Head to Head and there are no bans or warmups.
2. In the lobby, the players will play through the entire mappool once, in the order given on the mappool sheet. This means you will play through the NM maps, then HD, then HR, and then DT.
3. In the event of any disconnects, the player who disconnects will be allowed to replay the map after the run by themselves.
4. Qualifier scores will be hidden until all players have played, in order to prevent seed manipulation, which means that the player placing 32nd will play against the player placing 1st, etc.
