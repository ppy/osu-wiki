## Match results

*TBD*

## Ruleset

### General rules

1. Only users in the Kingdom of Denmark can enter. This is determined by the profile-flag on a player's userpage (Eg. a player with either of these flags is eligible to participate: ![][flag_DK], ![][flag_FO], ![][flag_GL])
2. This tournament uses a qualifier into a double-elimination bracket and single-player format. There are no teams here.
3. The score system used will be **Score V2**.
4. To participate you **must** join the Discord for the duration of the tournament.
5. Match schedule is decided by the organisers. Players may ask for a reschedule if the current schedule does not work for them. Every stage will last one weekend.
6. If there are no referees available, the match can be postponed.
7. If both players get the same score on a Tiebreaker, the Tiebreaker will be replayed.
8. Players have 15 minutes to show up to their scheduled match. If the opponent doesn't show up, the player who was supposed to play automatically advances onwards.
9. If a player is found to be abusive or rude to other players in the tournament, they may be removed from the tournament at the organizer's discretion. This will never be done without talking to the parties involved. If conduct is bad enough, players may be blacklisted from future tournaments and reported to osu! moderation staff. Trashtalk is fine - harrasment is not.
10. Any other rules changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced on the Discord server.

### Stage regulations

1. There are seven stages to this tournament: Qualifiers, Round of 32, Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
2. Seeding is determined from qualifier performance based on overall score (#1 vs #32, #2 vs #31, #3 vs #30 ... #16 vs #17). This means that only the 32 best performing players will be able to play in the tournament. All other players are placed into the fallback category as potential replacements if one of the 32 seeded players no-shows.
3. If a player no-shows they will forfeit the match.
4. The win-condition for each stage is listed below:
   - Round of 32: Best of 7 (first to 4 points)
   - Round of 16: Best of 9 (first to 5 points)
   - Quarterfinals: Best of 11 (first to 6 points)
   - Semifinals: Best of 11 (first to 6 points)
   - Finals and Grand Finals: Best of 13 (first to 7 points)
5. In the Grand Finals the player from the Loser's Bracket must first beat the player from the Winner's Bracket to force a bracket-reset, before playing for the final win.

## Qualifier regulations

1. Qualifiers will have a 10 minute max buffer-room to accommodate any delayed players.
2. For any players who are still unable to join their assigned lobby, they will have the option of rescheduling to a later lobby, unless their assigned lobby is the last one.
3. Players must finish their lobby in one run and will **NOT** be given second chances should issues arise half-way through a lobby. If this is to happen please contact organizers.

### Match regulations

1. A private lobby will be created for your match, and both players will be invited approx. 10 minutes before their appointed time.
2. Each player can request one warmup map, but it must be **below 4 minutes**. (Does not apply to Qualifiers, as there are no warmups)
3. After warmups each player will `!roll`:
   - The player who rolled the higher number bans first. The players will then alternate bans until all bans have been used. (High -> Low -> High -> Low)
   - The first person to pick will be the player who rolled the lower number. The players will then alternate picks. (Low -> High -> Low -> High -> ...)
4. A player cannot ban a map from the same category twice.
5. A player cannot pick the same mod twice in a row, with the exception of Nomod.
6. In case of a tie, the tiebreaker will be played.
7. When FreeMod is picked each player must use at least one mod. Allowed mods are: FL, HD, HR
8. If a player disconnects or experiences trouble within the first 15 seconds of a map, the referee must abort the match if notified of the issue. If anyone is found to abuse this rule, they will be banned from all future instances of the tournament.
9. Results will be displayed on the Challonge bracket, and will be announced by the referee in the match lobby.

### Mappool regulations

1. There are different mappools for each stage of the tournament, becoming progressively harder.
2. Tiebreakers will be played with FreeMod, but will not require a mod to be picked.
3. The mappool will be announced **every Sunday** before a stage, and the categories are NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime, FreeMod and Tiebreaker.

### Scheduling regulations

1. Every stage is scheduled for the weekend.
2. Matches are allowed to overlap if referees are available.
3. Players must complete their match at the designated time or both players are eliminated.
4. However, if both players can come up with a better time than what we have scheduled for them, please inform the organisers for a reschedule. Organisers will rearrange the match if they are informed before Thursday of the week the match is to be played and a referee is available.
