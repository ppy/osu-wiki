# Community Tournaments

This is the place where tournament hosts can add a wiki page for their tournaments.

## Contributing

We urge you to look at the [template for official tournaments](Template) as a reference for how an acceptable tournament wiki page should look.

Please make sure to read the README on the [front page of this repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki) for other contributing guidelines.
