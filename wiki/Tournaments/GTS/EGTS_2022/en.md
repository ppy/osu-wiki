3. A best effort will be made to fit schedules with applicable timezones. The schedule for each stage will be released the weekend prior to it.

### Match regulations

2. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
3. If one of the players is late, the maximum time the match can be postponed is **10 minutes**.
4. There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly at match time as long as it is within the postponed time.
5. If neither of the players are in the lobby after 10 minutes, the highest seeded player will advance.
6. The match will be played with Head to Head and Score v2, and the name of the room must be: `EGTS 2022: ({Player Red}) vs ({Player Blue})`.
7. Each player is allowed one warmup map, but it must be **below 3 minutes in length**, and must be sent to the [GTS website](https://gtsosu.com/egts/home) up to one hour prior to the match's start time. Otherwise, the player will have no warmup.
8. Submitting a warmup less than one hour prior to the match will result in no warmup.
9. Warmups may not be offensive or NSFW (not safe for work).
10. Each player has to ban **one beatmap** from the pool (apart from tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any player in the entire match.
11. Each player will roll with the `!roll` command in the chat.
12. The player with the highest roll **bans second and picks first**. The player with the lowest roll **bans first and picks second**.
13. Each player has 2 minutes to announce their ban. If they do not tell the referee by that time, the ban will be made with a `!roll`.
14. Beatmap selection will then alternate between each player selecting a beatmap out of the mappool.
15. Players may pick freely from any bracket.
16. Players will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a player does not pick before the end of the timer, the map will be picked with a `!roll`.
17. If a player disconnects between beatmaps, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once.
18. Disconnections are treated as failing the map.
19. A beatmap can be replayed upon a disconnection that happened within 30 seconds of starting. This is only allowed once per player.
20. Failed players' scores do count.
21. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. If it does end in a tie again, the map will be nullified again, and the player who picked it will have to pick another map.
22. In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected.
