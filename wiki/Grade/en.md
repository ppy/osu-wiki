# Grade

**Grades** in osu! are a set of letters representing a player's performance on a given [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). Grades accompany the total [score](/wiki/Score) at the result screen and appear in all lists alongside scores.

From lowest to highest, the possible grades are F, C, B, A, S, Silver S, SS, and Silver SS. Silver grades are only achievable when using the Hidden, Flashlight, or Fade-in [game modifiers](/wiki/Game_Modifiers).
