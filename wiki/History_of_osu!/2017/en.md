## June

The osu! team participates in Anime Expo for the upcoming 10 years of osu!. On 2017-06-15, the main menu/playfield image has been changed to four generic, but new, images. The playfield image changes when the current song is changed. Support for enabling or disabling the seasonal backgrounds all year round or sometimes seeing them has been added to the [Options](/wiki/Client/Options). Somewhere around this month, inside the [osu! Discord server](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers#official), the osu!weekly was discussed to have been dead.
