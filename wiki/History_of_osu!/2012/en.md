# History of osu! 2012

## March

A new feature was tested out which added an integrated [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) web chat to the osu! website.[^web-chat]

## April

::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) hosted an art contest for achievement graphics, in which users were required to design icons for various given standalone and beatmap pack titles. The users whose graphics were picked by peppy received 3 months of [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) as a reward.[^achievements]

![](img/achievement-submission.jpg "Exemplary icons submitted for the contest")

## May

A [live stream listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/livestreams) was added to the osu! website displaying users who were streaming osu! on [Twitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)) at the respective moment.[^live-stream-listing]

## August

osu! received an update featuring a SS [grade](/wiki/Gameplay/Grade) version of the [Sudden Death](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Sudden_death) mod and game mode filters for the user list, among other things.[^stable-b0813]

From 11 June to 1 July, participants in the [osu! 2012 T-shirt Design Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/86971?n=1) were required to create artworks for t-shirts sold in the osu!store. Following the contest, a public voting was organised to determine the winning submissions. ::{ flag=CN }:: [Ballance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/165946) won the 1st place with 324 votes. Prizes for the finalists included a t-shirt with the user's submission printed on it, a 20$ gift to freely spend on any available merchandise and varying amounts of osu!supporter.[^shirt-voting][^shirt-winner]

## September

:::

osu! and its community celebrated osu!'s 5th birthday on September 17, 2012. During this time, all players were granted [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) tags for 24 hours, beginning at 2012-09-16 (18:00 UTC), which was osu!'s original release time in 2007. peppy had intended to distribute an early version of osu! in some form or another for the celebration, so players were able to experience osu! from an earlier time, where the roots of the program were. However, because of differing `.dll` file versions, peppy was unable to get it working. He published it eventually a few months later in [April 2013](/wiki/History_of_osu!/2013#april).[^five-years]

## October

![](img/2012-10_01.jpg "osu!mania logo")

On October 8, the Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game (VSRG) [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) implemented by ::{ flag=CN }:: [woc2006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1105845) was released to the public.[^stable-b1008] The community voiced mixed opinions on the new game mode. Some players gave praise over the effort done while others criticised the score [judgement](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/osu!mania) for being too strict in comparison to O2JAM, a rhythm game with similar gameplay mechanics. For some players the update felt too rushed, as ranking, submitting osu!mania beatmaps, difficulty modification and gameplay were not polished enough or completed. A few players had issues updating their osu! client due to the enormous size of the update (around 20 MB). Most of these issues had been resolved in November with a lot of feedback from the community. Nevertheless, many users wanted to try out the new game mode<!--TODO: data on how many exactly?-->.

:::

For players who entered the [multiplayer](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer) lobby before updating to the b20121008 build, there was a bug causing a comical appearance of osu!mania named as "3" without the game mode icon. Players were not able to play in the room without applying the update.

![](img/2012-10_02.jpg "Per-object hitsounds as seen on the left of the editor")

:::

In addition to the new game mode, the following had been implemented in the update:

- Per-object hitsounds were added in the editor, thanks to ::{ flag=CA }:: [mm201](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30655).
- Players became able to recover from failing in [multiplayer](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer) by reaching full HP (this was not the case if the [Sudden Death](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Sudden_Death) or [Perfect](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Perfect) mod was enabled).
- Scrolling support was added to the in-game online ranking list.
- Improvements for the [skin selection](/wiki/Client/Options#skin) to make the preview play more realistically.

::{ flag=FR }:: [Kurai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089) helped in setting up the new osu!store to offer the designs submitted in the [t-shirt design contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/94466?n=1) on high-quality t-shirts, with the eventual goal of expanding the product range to other items such as stickers<!--related to the wiki article "past osu! store items"?-->.[^osu-market]

![](img/2012-10_04.jpg "Background change as shown by peppy")

:::

The osu! update on October 29 included a change for the main menu, allowing players with osu!supporter to customise the background image. Gameplay was not affected in any way by this pure visual alteration. osu!mania received its own ranking system which was highly anticipated by the community. To ensure no cheated scores made it into the ranking, there was a testing phase until November in which the leaderboard was reset several times.[^stable-b1029][^stable-b0904]

Furthermore, when watching replays (or while spectating) in the osu! game mode, users became able to see what buttons the player pressed on the button status overlay. This overlay could also be activated while in singleplayer via the `Always show key overlay` setting in the [Options](/wiki/Client/Options#general.1) menu. It was placed at the top of the screen initially but later moved to the right of the screen to not obstruct the HP bar and potentially impact the player's focus.

Lastly, a few long-term performance issues were resolved that had caused occasional game-freezes.

## November

The osu!mania ranking system had been finalised and all scores were reset one last time on November 13.[^mania-ranking]

In the update on November 22, localisations provided by voluntary contributors in the [osu! localisation project v2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/104342) were added to osu!, making the game available in several languages. On top of this, a `Quick Join` button was added to the multiplayer lobby, enabling players to randomly join a room<!--no caution to the player's abilities regarding difficulty?-->.[^stable-b1122]

[Google Translate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate) was added to the osu! website on November 8 as an optional feature, where users became able to choose a language and the website would be automatically translated<!--data on how long this was available?, lots of bugs and translation issues-->.[^website-translation]

A new section was added to the screenshot page displaying a selection of popular images that were uploaded when pressing `Shift`+ `F12` in-game.[^week-in-osu-2]

<!-- Other:

- Improve right-click behaviour at song select, allowing right-clicking non-current beatmap to still display options.
- Fun Spoiler Settings was available during replay/spectating a player.

-->

## December

![](img/2012-12_01.png "Art by RBRat3")

On December 21, osu! had received new features and changes, with the most notable ones being:

1. widescreen support
2. a loading screen when entering a beatmap
3. the `Fun Spoiler` settings were replaced with the new [Visual Settings](/wiki/Client/Interface/Visual_settings) menu, which was placed at the bottom of the screen
4. [No Video](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/No_video) mod was moved to the visual settings menu.

The widescreen support, despite being functional, caused some images and videos to look weird (the head of a character not being visible as well as missing or partly hidden text) because the top and bottom were cropped. [Storyboards](/wiki/Storyboard) did not support widescreen at the time, instead, letterboxes or black bars would appear on the sides which caused them to look cramped. This created an issue for Catch the Beat[^catch] as the fruit would go *over* the black bars that were supposed to be in the boundary when using widescreen. Some storyboards also did not function properly (some images did not stay in the playing area, but instead, extended out to the black bars).[^stable-b1221]

After passing a beatmap once, users also became able to dim the background to 100% via the new visual settings menu.[^week-in-osu-6]

On December 25, a new version of [Bancho](/wiki/Bancho_(server)) was released which reduced the amount of network traffic when connecting to the server. Being a special occasion, osu!direct was available for everyone for the day.[^stable-b1225]
