# History of osu! 2014

## January

The entire [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_points) system was completely disabled for maintenance on 20 January 2014 due to miscalculations that had occurred over the previous few months.[^ranking-maintenance] This disabling was then followed by an announcement on 26 January 2014 that detailed a complete, from-the-ground-up redesign of the pp system that was set live the next day.[^new-perf-ranking][^pp-article] The new system was designed and implemented by [Tom94](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1857058) and had aimed to base pp scores off of a new "difficulty value" (separate from [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating)) that was determined for every [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) and [mod](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier) combination in the game.[^ranking-maintenance] As a result of this, the old pp system was renamed to "ppv1" and the new system was named "ppv2".

## March

On 1 March 2014 the performance points system redesign by Tom94 in months prior was ready to be set live for [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) as the official ranking system for those modes, along with a reminder that the current system was not yet 100% finished, and further feedback from players was still needed.[^all-game-modes]

As [skinning](/wiki/Skinning) elements expanded, the element `playfield.jpg` was deprecated and replaced with a new generic one that is not modifiable. `playfield.jpg` was an element that allowed skinners to use any image as the default background of a beatmap if one was not supplied. This functionality was later brought in the form of `menu-background.jpg`, which changed both the main screen and default playfield backgrounds.[^change-background][^skinning]<!--date needed-->

## April

The first ever "osu! Monthly Fanart Contest" was announced on 3 April 2014. The contest was an informal contest run by [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) that would run monthly and award two winners one year of [osu!supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) (one picked by public and the other by osu! staff).[^fanart] The first contest was concluded in a [newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2014-05-21-first-official-osu-fanart-contest-results) on 21 May 2014 with players [kunny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3931585) and [DumplingYumYum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715930) winning first and second place respectively.[^fanart-results]

## June

On 18 June 2014, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) announced that the download limitations would be removed for all users; however, there was still a, quote, "sanity limit" that would prevent bots from downloading an inhuman amount of beatmaps.[^download]

## August

On 21 August 2014, a [newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2014-08-21-restructuring-of-the-bat) was released announcing a new restructuring of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team (BAT)](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team), which detailed the separation of the original team into the Beatmap Appreciation Team and the [Quality Assurance Team (QAT)](/wiki/Modding/Quality_Assurance_Team).[^bat]

## October

October brought a handful of new additions to the base game, including a new sign in screen and new system for scrolling in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) based off of beatmap BPM, new intro and outro sequences, and a custom theme song that was to be played on startup (as opposed to a random beatmap).<!--citation needed-->

Additionally, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) also released the "osu!test" build (now known as "Cutting Edge") to all players, as opposed to just [osu!supporters](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) in an attempt to help debugging efforts.<!--citation needed-->
