# History of osu! 2015

## March

peppy reconsiders that his current business model will not obtain him his "Private osu! G6 Jet" and enables the *[osu!coin](/wiki/osu!coin)* to hopefully increase revenue. Every current player was given 10 osu!coins to play (at the rate of 1 play = 1 osu!coin). These can be replenished after obtaining a combo of multiples of 100. Or simply by purchasing them at these rates:

- 1 osu!coin = $1 USD
- 10 osu!coins = $10 USD
- 1000 osu!coins = $999USD (Saves you 0.001%! BEST VALUE!)
- Infinite osu!coins = Your first unborn child - osu! needs more team members, have your unborn child work off your debts! :)

## April

The next day, peppy decides to rollback on the osu!coins due to popular demand. A new subdomain for the osu!web redesign was opened for preview.
