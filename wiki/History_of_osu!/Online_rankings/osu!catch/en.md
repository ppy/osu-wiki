# osu!catch rankings history

The following is a list of players who are recognised to have reached rank #1 in the [global ranking](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/fruits/performance) of [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch).

Over the years, there were three different systems used for ranking players:

- [Ranked Score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score/Ranked_score) (6 November 2008 – 24 July 2012)
- [ppv1](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv1) (24 July 2012 – 27 January 2014)
- [ppv2](/wiki/Performance_points) (27 January 2014 – present)

Because of this, this list only includes players who have reached rank #1 on the main leaderboard that was used at the time. *Italicised* dates and numbers indicate that the corresponding player is continuing their reign as the osu!catch's rank #1 holder either from the previous year or into the following year.

*Note: osu!catch recieved a full global leaderboard reset on 7 December 2008, scores from before this date are no longer available.*

<!-- TODO: Further research into the Ranked Score and ppv1 leaderboards.
A timeline for Ranked Score should be feasible but would take some significant work.
ppv1 is rather infeasible without a lot of digging, little information is publically available from around this period.
