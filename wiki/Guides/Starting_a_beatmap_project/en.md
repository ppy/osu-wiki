# How to start a beatmap project

*Notice: This article is about the [Beatmap Projects](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/53) forum section and how to approach it. Make sure to read its [forum rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/453937) before posting.*

## Making an informative thread title

*Yes, your thread's title will determine if other osu! users will "yay" or "nay" your beatmap project, even before they click on it!*

`[Discography]` / `[Album]` / `[Collab]` should be added before the title. Chances are high that your project will be ignored or moved to the [Abandoned Wasteland](/wiki/Community/Forum/Abandoned_Wasteland) if the thread's title isn't descriptive enough.

Good examples:

- `[Album] Pandora Voxx -complete-`
- `[Discography] Deemo`

Bad example:

- `starting a new project, need your help with this album`

### Which one do I use?

**Discography:** List of albums or songs released by the singer, group, or composer, or as the soundtrack for a game.

Examples:

- [\[Discog\] osu! needs more Duca!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/98205)
- [\[Discography\] Linkin Park](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/121592)
- [\[Discography\] Cytus](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/177446)

**Album:** List of songs in the album.

Examples:

- [\[Album\] Anamanaguchi - Scott Pilgrim vs The World (the game)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/37908)
- [\[Album\] Daft Punk - Random Access Memories](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/132592)

**Collab:** Creating a [group-mapping project](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_collaborations) for a certain song. May range from [storyboard](/wiki/Storyboard) request to mapping parts of a [marathon map](/wiki/Beatmap/Marathon).

Example:

- [Within Temptation - The Unforgiving](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/29157)
