# How to use the offset wizard

To make the offset wizard easier to use, you will need to get the following beatmap: [peppy - Offset Wizard (peppy)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/4659).
After downloading, load it up in osu! then follow these instructions:

1. Turn down the effects volume to `0%`.
2. Find it in your beatmap list and select it.
3. Press `F3` and `5`.
4. Navigate to (almost) the start of the beatmap.
5. Click on `Test` or press `F5`.
6. **Listen to the beat.** You will need to see when you *should* be hitting the circles.
7. Restart the play test but close your eyes this time. This time, you should be clicking to the beat when you hear it. You will click 16 times.
8. Open your eyes and take a look at how much you got your ms too early or too late.
9. Go to the options and set your Universal Adjustment by `-x` if you were late or by `+x` if you were early.
10. Repeat steps 2 - 9, this time the too early / too late values should be smaller.
11. Repeat the 10th step until the difference gets really small (±4ms).
12. Enjoy *actually* clicking to the rhythm!

## Notes

- Using fullscreen mode and windowed mode may require recalibration since fullscreen mode can lower input latency.
- The effects volume should be zero when doing this because the hitsound can confuse you while doing this.
- Using other game modes may require extensive recalibration.
