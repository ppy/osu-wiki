# How to add custom hitsounds

From the thread: *[how to add custom hitsound? by: neonat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/3215699)* (and modified)

## Getting the custom hitsounds

You'll first need some custom hitsounds! You can either:

- You can get them from the [Custom Hitsound Library](/wiki/Guides/Custom_Hitsound_Library),
- or make your own
  - if you do make your own, try to keep the format as `.wav` - as it is best for looping.

Once you get them, move them into the song folder itself. If you don't know where your song folder is located, follow these directions:

1. Open osu!
2. Edit
3. Navigate to *your beatmap* and open it
4. Files (top-left menu, it is an off-white coloured bar at the top)
5. Open song folder
6. *and paste them here*

Now that you have them inside the song folder, it is important (sort of) to name them to what you want them to be. For example, it could be named "finish", "whistle", "clap", "normal hit", or "loud noises".

Depending on which kind of hitsound you want it to fall under, you start the file name as "soft", "normal" or "drum".

You then decide if you want it to be the normal hit, clap, whistle or finish.

### Example 1

So then you name the file (let's say the Soft clap) `soft-hitclap.wav`.

## Multiple hitsounds with the same name

If you want more variety and need more options for clap and all, you just add a number behind it.

### Example 2

Like `normal-hitclap2.wav` or like `soft-hitfinish3.wav`

Don't forget to go to the timing setup and change the hitsound choice to custom, and to the specific number
