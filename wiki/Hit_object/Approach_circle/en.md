# Approach circle

*Approach circles* are coloured circles which shrink around [hit circles](/wiki/Hit_object/Hit_circle) in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps). They help players determine when to click to earn the biggest amount of [score](/wiki/Score) by overlapping with the hit circle at the correct moment in a song. The time it takes for an approach circle to reach a hit circle is determined by a beatmap's [approach rate](/wiki/Beatmapping/Approach_rate) which is set by the mapper. The colour of approach circles is also determined by the combo colours used by the mapper of a beatmap.
