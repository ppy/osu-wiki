# Sliderbody

A *sliderbody* makes up the path between a [sliderhead](/wiki/Hit_object/Sliderhead) and [slidertail](/wiki/Hit_object/Slidertail) in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps). The player has to follow the sliderbody along its path once the sliderhead has been clicked until the slidertail is reached. The sliderbody is the most versatile part of sliders as it can be manipulated with [slider anchors](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider_anchor) and [slider velocity](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider_velocity) changes. The colour of sliderbodies is determined by the combo colours used by the mappers of a beatmap.<!-- TODO: Insert curve algorithm in here somewhere maybe-->
