# ppv2

**ppv2** is the current algorithm of the [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) system, and aims to represent how difficult it is to achieve a given play on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). It was originally implemented by [Tom94](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1857058), but has been further improved by users on the [osu! Discord server](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers#official) since then.

<!--TODO: Link a lot of stuff and add formulas for the algorithm itself-->
