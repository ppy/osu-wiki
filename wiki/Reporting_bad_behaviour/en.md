# Reporting bad behaviour

osu! has a team of moderators, the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) (GMT), that operates to keep the game and its ecosystem clean and safe. If you notice rule-breaking behaviour or inappropriate content, report it using one of the methods described below. Alternatively, you may contact any of the moderators online directly if your report wasn't properly handled within a reasonable amount of time — do so only as the last resort.

Accidental reports are ignored. Users who deliberately send invalid reports can risk being [silenced](/wiki/Silence).

## Special cases

| Nature of infringement | Point of contact |
| :-- | :-- |
| Scamming/Phishing in private messages | Send a regular report |
| Other offensive/inappropriate private messages | **None**: [ignore the user](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console#commands-list) instead. For permanent effect, use the in-game ignore list located in [options](/wiki/Client/Options) or block them on the website with the button located on their user profile. |
| Inappropriate content in [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) beatmaps[^invalid-reports] | [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (NAT) or [GMT](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team), via the [BN Management](https://bn.mappersguild.com/reports) website |
| Inappropriate conduct from a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) | [NAT](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), via the [BN Management](https://bn.mappersguild.com/reports) website |
| Inappropriate conduct from a member of the [NAT](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) or [GMT](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) | [Account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) at [support@ppy.sh](mailto:support@ppy.sh) |
| Beatmap plagiarism or other copyright infringement | File a DMCA claim to [copyright@ppy.sh](mailto:copyright@ppy.sh) as per the [osu! copyright policy](/wiki/Legal/Copyright) |
| Sexual abuse or extreme misbehaviour | Refer to [Reporting Abuse](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour/Abuse) |

For anything else, see the instructions below.

## In-game chat

### The !report command

*Caution: Reporting a user via the `!report` command in osu!(lazer) or via the website will cause the report to be **visible to everyone!** Instead, [use the report menu](#lazer-reports) or report them via [their profile page](#profile-page).*

![](img/report-command.jpg "Example of using the !report command")

Chat misbehaviour is the most common infringement. To report it, use [the `!report` command](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/34843), preferably in the channel where the infringement(s) took place. Don't feel stressed: if your message starts with `!report` and a space, and you sent it from within osu!(stable) or an IRC client, **it is only visible to moderators** and no one else in the chat. You can also use the report function via the osu!(stable) client's [in-game overlay](#stable-reports) as depicted below if you are still concerned.

The command's syntax has two forms:

```
!report username
!report username (free-form description follows)
```

If there are spaces in the username, replace them with underscores:

```
!report bad_user spamming in #osu
```

If your report was successful, BanchoBot will send you a private message stating that moderators have been alerted. 

Note that the `!report` command **does not work** in osu!(lazer). Please report users via [the report menu](#lazer-reports) instead.

### In-game overlay in osu!(stable) {id=stable-reports}
