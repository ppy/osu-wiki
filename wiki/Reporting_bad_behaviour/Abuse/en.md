# Reporting abuse

## I don't know if I should report this or not {id=reportworthiness}

Please do.

If you're uncomfortable enough that you're reading this page, please contact us at once at [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) with as much detail about your problem as possible.

We have zero tolerance towards any sort of unwanted sexual attention or advances in this community.

The abuse email address is only seen by [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) (the creator of the game).

Nothing you send to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) will ever be shared with anybody else other than him.

There is no "statute of limitations" for abuse on osu! — do not hesitate to report something because of how long ago it happened.

## What is considered sexual misconduct? {id=what}

Any behaviour that would likely violate another user's sexual integrity or make them feel harassed is considered unacceptable. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Requesting sexual images or acts from another user
- Sending another user sexual images or text without reasonable cause
- Making another user feel pressured to enter or remain in a romantic relationship

**Sexual or romantic conduct will usually not be considered inappropriate if both parties consent to it.** However, if a user is underage (i.e. less than 18 years old), sexual conduct with them may be considered problematic regardless of their consent, especially if the age difference between the users is more than a year or two. If you are not sure about someone's age, ask them, and if you are still not sure, refrain from sexual or romantic conduct towards them.

While forming a relationship with another user you know well is entirely acceptable (underage users notwithstanding), **actively using osu! to look for romantic or sexual partners is not allowed** as it is not what most other users are here for, and doing so will very likely make someone uncomfortable at some point.

## Someone's made inappropriate sexual advances or remarks towards me! {id=bad-remarks}

Scroll through the sub-headings below to find out what to do, depending on where this all happened.

### In the in-game chat {id=chat}

*Caution: Reporting a user via the `!report` command in osu!(lazer) or via the website will cause the report to be **visible to everyone!** Instead, [use the report menu](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour#lazer-reports) or report them via [their profile page](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour#profile-page).*

Immediately block the user by right-clicking or long-pressing their username and selecting `Ignore User` in osu!(stable) or `Block` in osu!(lazer).

You should also report them immediately by clicking the  `Report User...` or `Report` button and filling in the prompts.

If you are using osu!(stable) or an IRC client, you can also report the user by typing `!report <person> <problem>`, where `<person>` is the username of the person causing you problems, and `<problem>` is a short explanation of the problems. If there are spaces in the person's username, please replace them with underscores (`_`).

If you feel the remarks/advances were highly inappropriate, it isn't the first time that the user has made inappropriate remarks towards you, or you are an underage user, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible.

### In a public post on the osu! forums {id=forums}

[Report the post](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour#forum) to our [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) as soon as possible.

To do so, click the `Report post` button in the top right corner of the forum post.

If the post isn't gone within a reasonable timeframe, click the username of any GMT member in the list on that page. This will take you to their profile. Alternatively, you can use [this link instead](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) and click on any currently online user.

Click the button with an envelope in it just below the user's country flag. This will take you to the chat screen.

Paste a link to the forum post that contains the problematic content and tell the GMT member a little bit about what's going on. They will remove the post for you as soon as they are able to.

If the post still isn't gone within a reasonable timeframe, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible.

### Anywhere else on the osu! website {id=other}

Refer to the relevant section of the article [Reporting bad behaviour](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour). If you are not sure how to report the inappropriate conduct in question, contact [a member of the Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4).

If you feel like there is a pattern of inappropriate advances/remarks from a given user towards you, these remarks are highly inappropriate, or you are an underage user, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible.

### On a public osu!–related Discord server {id=discord}

Immediately block the user by right-clicking their username and selecting `Block` in the drop-down list that appears. Note that the user may notice you have blocked them — if you are worried this will make the problem worse elsewhere, you can select `Ignore`, which the user cannot find out you have done. Refer to [Discord's guide to ignoring users](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/28084948873623-How-to-Ignore-Users-on-Discord) for more information.

Afterwards, contact the administrators of the server at once by looking for someone at the very top of the users list and let them know what happened. If you can't figure out who is an administrator, look for someone with a crown next to their name — they are the server owner and are responsible for what happens within it.

Should this abuse continue and the administrators do nothing about it, [please notify the Discord Trust & Safety team by filing out a report](https://dis.gd/request).

If you know the osu! username of the person bothering you, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible and it will be investigated as time allows. Note that we cannot act on content on third party services, so there is no guarantee that we will take action, but we will keep any notes on file.

### On a Twitter linked to an osu! user's profile {id=twitter}

Click the three dots in the top right of the problem tweet and click 'Report Tweet'. Make sure to follow the prompts and read them carefully. You might also want to read [Twitter's guide on reporting abusive behaviour](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/report-abusive-behavior) for more information on the process.

Afterwards, either block or mute the user in question by clicking the three dots in the top right of their tweet (if you're using the website or mobile client). Consult [Twitter's guide on blocking accounts](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/blocking-and-unblocking-accounts) for more information.

Please be aware that the person will see you have blocked them if they check your Twitter profile. If you are worried this will make the problem worse elsewhere, mute them instead. This will remove their tweets from your timeline and prevent you from seeing any more content from them, but they will still be able to see and comment on all the tweets you make.

If you know the osu! username of the person bothering you, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible and it will be investigated as time allows. Note that we cannot act on content on third party services, so there is no guarantee that we will take action, but we will keep any notes on file.

## A member of one of the volunteer teams (NAT, GMT) is approaching/talking/acting towards me inappropriately! {id=volunteer}

Send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible **immediately**. This includes screenshots, chat logs, and basically anything else you can attach to an email.

If you can't find the messages for any reason, but remember at least roughly when they were sent and are sure they were sent in osu!'s chat, include this information instead — the abuse team has full access to public and private chat logs.

If anything you want to include makes you feel embarrassed, please blank it out. 

We'll look into it as soon as we can.

## Someone I know is being abused by a member of the volunteer teams (NAT, GMT) but is too afraid to speak up! {id=friend}

Send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing everything you know with as much evidence as you can get.

If you don't have any evidence, but only stories or rumours that you believe are substantial enough to act on, please send us an email anyway. We take complaints like this very seriously and will look deeply into every report.

## I think I have acted inappropriately towards someone and want to admit it {id=own-misconduct}

Send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) detailing any of your behaviour that you think may have been inappropriate. Include as many screenshots and chat logs as you can, and try to explain the context for why the behaviour was inappropriate if it is relevant.

## My email has been ignored! {id=ignored}

If you haven't received a response to your email after a couple of weeks, please send a follow-up email.

The email was most likely lost somewhere along the way, but we still want to investigate your report.
