# Reporting abuse

## I don't know if I should report this or not

Please do.

If you're uncomfortable enough that you're reading this page, please contact us at once at [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) with as much detail about your problem as possible.

We have zero tolerance towards any sort of unwanted sexual attention or advances in this community.

The abuse email address is only seen by [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) (the creator of the game).

Nothing you send to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) will ever be shared with anybody else other than him.

## Someone's made inappropriate sexual advances or remarks towards me!

Scroll through the sub-headings below to find out what to do, depending on where this all happened.

### In the in-game chat

Immediately block the user by right-clicking their username and selecting `Ignore User`.

You should also report them immediately by clicking the `Report User` button and filling in the prompts.

You can also report the user by typing `!report <person> <problem>`, where  `<person>` is the username of the person causing you problems, and `<problem>` is a short explanation of the problems. If there are spaces in the person's username, please replace them with underscores (`_`).

If you feel the remarks/advances were highly inappropriate or you are an underage user, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible.

### In a public post on the osu! forums

[Report the post](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour#forum) to our [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) as soon as possible.

To do so, click the `Report post` button in the top right corner of the forum post.

Alternatively, click the username of any GMT member in the list on that page. This will take you to their profile. If you are unsure of who to click, just use [this link instead](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5999631).

Click the button with an envelope in it just below the user's country flag. This will take you to the chat screen.

Paste a link to the forum post that contains the problematic content and tell the GMT a little bit about what's going on. They will remove the post for you as soon as they are able.

If the post still isn't gone within a reasonable timeframe, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible.

### On a public osu!–related Discord server

Immediately block the user by right-clicking their username and selecting `Block` in the drop-down list that appears.

Afterwards, contact the administrators of the server at once by looking for someone at the very top of the users list and let them know what happened. If you can't figure out who is an administrator, look for someone with a crown next to their name — they are the server owner and are responsible for what happens within it.

Should this abuse continue and the administrators do nothing about it, [please notify the Discord Trust & Safety team by filing out a report](https://dis.gd/request).

In addition, if you know the osu! username of the person bothering you, please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible and it will be investigated promptly.

### On a Twitter linked to an osu! user's profile

Click the three dots in the top right of the problem tweet and click 'Report Tweet'. Make sure to follow the prompts and read them carefully. You might also want to read [Twitter's guide on reporting abusive behaviour](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/report-abusive-behavior) for more information on the process.

Afterwards, either block or mute the user in question by clicking the three dots in the top right of their tweet (if you're using the website or mobile client). Consult [Twitter's guide on blocking accounts](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/blocking-and-unblocking-accounts) for more information.

Please be aware that the person will see you have blocked them if they check your Twitter profile. If you are worried this will make the problem worse elsewhere, mute them instead. This will remove their tweets from your timeline and prevent you from seeing any more content from them, but they will still be able to see and comment on all the tweets you make.

If the tweet is from an account which is linked to an osu! player's profile via our website (it will appear underneath their avatar and join date beside a stylised bird icon), please send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing a copy of the tweet in image form wherever possible, and any other information you can think of.

## A member of one of the volunteer teams (NAT, GMT) is approaching/talking/acting towards me inappropriately!

Send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing as much information as possible **immediately**. This includes screenshots, chat logs, basically anything you can attach to an email.

If anything you want to include makes you feel embarrassed, please blank it out. 

We'll look into it as soon as we can.

## Someone I know is being abused by a member of the volunteer teams (NAT, GMT) but is too afraid to speak up!

Send an email to [abuse@ppy.sh](mailto:abuse@ppy.sh) containing everything you know with as much evidence as you can get.

If you don't have any evidence but only stories or rumours that you believe are substantial enough to act on, please send us an email anyway. We take complaints like this very seriously and will look deeply into every report.

## My email has been ignored!

If you haven't received a response to your email after a couple of weeks, please send a follow-up email.

The email was most likely lost somewhere along the way, but we still want to investigate your report.
