**up.ppy.sh**, often referred to as **upppy**, was a file uploading service ran and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). It was first established in January 2007, predating osu! itself[^upppy-launch-date-ref], and was mainly used to share images and files within the osu! community.

## Service

upppy was created as a free, lightweight alternative to proprietary image hosting services such as Rapidshare or ImageShack.[^upppy-image-hosting-ref]

The service did not require any registration to use and allowed anyone to upload files anonymously within its Terms of Service. Similar to certain [imageboard sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard), upon uploading a file, users were given a choice as to whether to post the upload in the default, catch-all working channel (`#random`) or in one of the more specific channels:

   - `#anime`
   - `#game`
   - `#highres`
   - `#music`
   - `#photography`
   - `#screenshots`
   - `#torrents`
   - `#tv`
   - `#video`
   - `#wallpaper`

Once a file was posted, it became a permanent part of the platform and could not be deleted or edited by the uploader. Much like on [Reddit](/wiki/Community/Reddit), these posts could still receive comments and be upvoted/downvoted by other users.

## Decommissioning

As upppy used [Adobe Flash Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player) in its upload form, new file uploads were effectively frozen starting from December 31, 2020 due to the [shutdown of Adobe Flash Player](https://www.adobe.com/id_en/products/flashplayer/end-of-life-alternative.html) save for users who were still running very old browsers. Sometime in early 2025, the entire website was taken down completely, leaving only an error page when accessed.
