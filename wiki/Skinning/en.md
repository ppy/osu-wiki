# Skinning

Skinning is one of the key features of osu!. It enables players to develop their own skin based on the default skinning elements provided by the game. These skins can vary from being for-fun, themed, professional, or be nigh impossible to play with.

## Skinning sets

*Main page: [Skin set list](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/Skin_set_list)*

**For beatmaps only,** if your beatmap skin contains a single element from the listed sets in the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria), it must contain all of the other elements within said skinning set. This only applies to beatmap skins, but other skinners are advised to follow these lists as well to preserve the integrity of their skin.

## Skin elements lists

The list of skinning elements is split up into several categories as follows:

- [Skinning interface](/wiki/Skinning/Interface)
- [Skinning osu!](/wiki/Skinning/osu!)
- [Skinning osu!taiko](/wiki/Skinning/osu!taiko)
- [Skinning osu!catch](/wiki/Skinning/osu!catch)
- [Skinning osu!mania](/wiki/Skinning/osu!mania)
- [Skinning sounds](/wiki/Skinning/Sounds)
