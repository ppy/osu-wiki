The **beatmap editor** is osu!'s in-game graphical interface for creating [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps). It is separated into four modes:

-   [Compose](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Compose): This is where [Hit Objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) are placed and edited. Most of the time spent in the editor is done here.
-   [Design](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Design): This is where the Storyboard is made, most mappers will only use the "Background Image/Video" button here.
-   [Timing](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing): This is where the song's BPM and offset are entered. This window also control hitsounds if they aren't constant throughout the map.
-   [Song Setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup): This is where various options regarding the map are set. This includes combo colors and difficulty settings.
