The **beatmap editor** is osu!'s in-game graphical interface for creating [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). [Beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) is the act of creating beatmaps for osu!.

The beatmap editor is separated into four main sections which can be seen in the top-left corner of the editor:

- Compose
- Design
- Timing
- Song setup

## Compose

[Compose](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Compose) is where all [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) and other gameplay-related elements are created. Most mappers spend more time in this tab than all of the others because of this.

## Design

[Design](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Design) offers a way to make [storyboards](/wiki/Storyboards), the visual effects that accompany beatmaps. Because storyboards often have complex effects warranting usage of many storyboard commands, mappers also use [storyboard scripting](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) directly without entering the design tab.

## Timing

[Timing](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing) manages timing sections of a song and controls a beatmap's hitsounds. This is essential since a beatmap needs correct timing and appropriate feedback to match the gameplay experience to the rhythm of a song.

## Song setup

[Song setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) fills in a beatmap's [metadata](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup#song-and-map-metadata) and other things universal to a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmapsets). This includes the title of a song, the artist, the difficulty name, combo colours, etc.

## Other

Other components of the beatmap editor include:

- [AiMod](AiMod): An automated system that reports problems in a beatmap
- [Beat snap divisor](Beat_Snap_Divisor): Determines how objects snap to the timeline
- [Distance snap](Distance_Snap): The multiplier that affects how close or far hit objects are placed from each other
- [Kiai time](Kiai_Time): Special timing sections that help emphasize a part of a beatmap
- [Menu](Menu): Helps you navigate the beatmap editor
- [SB load](SB_Load): A number used to tell how demanding a storyboard is
- [Timelines](Timelines): Displays placed hit objects, breaks, and more
