# Code of conduct for modding and mapping

The **code of conduct for modding and mapping** is a set of rules and guidelines that apply to the entirety of the osu! [modding](/wiki/Modding) and [mapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) ecosystem and an extension to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). In order to ensure that mapping and modding discussions in threads take place in a constructive, positive and productive environment, a code of conduct is crucial to get everyone on the same page. When participating in the modding and mapping ecosystem, it is mandatory to follow this code of conduct. Misconduct that violates these rules might lead to [penalties issued to your account](/wiki/Silence).

## Behaviour and conduct

- **The goal of modding is to help a mapper improve their work.** If you're not interested in helping people or fostering a healthy discourse, steer clear of the discussion.
- **Consider what you're posting, why you're posting it, and who you're posting it to.** This will ensure your best intentions are conveyed and your post is easy to understand.
- **Be approachable.** Discussions are open to all users. Everyone is welcome to participate, including those who are new to the community. Be patient, understanding, and provide as much explanation as necessary so that everyone can learn and improve more quickly.
- **Treat others as you wish to be treated.** People are more receptive to kind, helpful suggestions than hostile ones. Stay on topic and keep away from personal attacks, hateful comments, and misplaced jokes to avoid derailing the thread.
- **Use the [discussion page](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion).** Discuss your suggestions with other community members. Otherwise, it is unlikely your concerns will be heard by anyone with the power to address them appropriately.

## Responding to a mod

It is a mapper's responsibility to keep up with the latest discussions in their beatmaps. Ignoring suggestions or not responding to them in a timely manner can discourage other modders from participating in the discussion.

When responding to someone's suggestions, it is important to consider the following:

- **Treat all suggestions as valid and equally important.** Don't draw hasty conclusions about the validity of a suggestion without properly assessing it.
- **Explain yourself clearly.** State what you changed, and if you disagree with a suggestion, explain why and what you did instead. This will not only help the modder to learn, but also allow future mods to be tailored to your concept or style.
- **Remain calm.** Say what needs to be said in order to explain yourself and leave it at that. No matter how unhelpful the suggestion was, responding with hostility, sarcasm, etc. will not help the situation.
- **Provide context.** By providing all relevant information in your responses to mods, you make it easier for future modders to understand the discussion.

## Further exchange and discussion

Sometimes, discussions will be drawn out, and a single mod and response isn't enough to bring all parties to an agreement. Perhaps the mapper doesn't agree with a suggestion, and the modder isn't satisfied with their response. Ideally, all discussions should find closure within a reasonable timeframe.

Consider the following guidelines when an agreement cannot be reached:

- **Ask if you're unsure about something.** Ask the person in question to explain what they meant. They should be more than willing to explain things to you in more detail.
- **Ask someone with more experience, such as a member of the [BN](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) or [NAT](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team).** While they are busy people, they should be able to help you reach an agreement.
- **Be open minded.** If you realise there's a more suitable alternative to something you originally suggested, don't be afraid of putting your pride aside. There are no wrong opinions, so try to understand alternative points of view rather than attack them.
- **If things are getting heated, take a break.** It is important to be at a right state of mind when discussing something. If you can't explain something through logic, you will not be able to explain it to them through violence either.
- **Report bad behaviour.** When things look to be getting out of hand, or if the discussion is struggling to stay on topic, [call a moderator](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour). Don't contribute to the problem by continuing to post.
