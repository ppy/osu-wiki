# Storyboard scripting

![An example of scripting in .osb.](img/SBS_Base.jpg "An example of scripting in .osb.")

In addition to using the [Storyboard Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Design)(Design tab) to create [Storyboards](/wiki/Storyboards) for maps, you can also use a plain text editor (such as Notepad or [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/)). This is referred to as "**Storyboarding by Scripting**" (SBS), and allows you to be more precise (to the pixel and the millisecond) as to when sprites appear, what they do, and so on.

## Beginner's guide

[Doomsday has provided a nice beginner's tutorial to the concepts of SBS here (12:22).](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ1YLDs-bZg)

## Full specification

It is primarily based on [the official specifications](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1869) and experience in making large SBs. This is **not a step-by-step guide**, although simple examples are provided. It is meant to exhaustively detail how SBS translates into actions on-screen in osu!.

[Please read the rule before doing SBS.](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting/General_Rules) It will save you the hassle later on. [For sprite/object spec.](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting/Objects) and [their moveset](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting/Commands).

Note: **Save on beatmap first** before saving in Notepad. Also, the editor can be insensitive at times so **save often**.
