# Storyboard .osu file toggles

*See also: [skin.ini](/wiki/Skinning/Skin.ini)*

The following are toggles that can be added to .osu (and in some cases, .osb files) to affect [skinning](/wiki/Skinning) / [storyboarding](/wiki/Storyboards). Those that are added/removed by the [Beatmap Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor) can also be included.

## Under [General] Section

`UseSkinSprites: 1`

Allows storyboards to refer to the player's current skin's sprites by their filenames. This is pointless if you're already forcing a skin (simply include the needed files) or have a map-specific skin in use. [Source](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1869?start=141760)
