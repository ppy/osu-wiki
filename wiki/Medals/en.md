# Medals

**Medals**, previously known as *achievements*, are badges on a user's profile which indicate certain goals that have been achieved by the user. Currently, there are **339** medals available to be unlocked across eight different categories in total: [Beatmap Packs](#beatmap-packs), [Skill](#skill), [Dedication](#dedication), [Mod Introduction](#mod-introduction), [Hush-Hush](#hush-hush), [Beatmap Spotlights](#beatmap-spotlights), [Seasonal Spotlights](#seasonal-spotlights), and [Beatmap Challenge Packs](#beatmap-challenge-packs).

## Beatmap Packs

**Beatmap Packs medals** are medals awarded upon completion of certain [Theme Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=theme), [Project Loved Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=loved) or [Artist/Album Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=artist). These medals can be obtained by clearing every beatmap all the way through at least once in any difficulty within the corresponding beatmap pack.

All beatmaps have to be cleared in the [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) game mode in order to qualify for the medal unless otherwise specified. The usage of either [difficulty reducing mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) or [difficulty increasing mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-increase), as well as [Spun Out](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Spun_Out), is permitted.

It is worth noting however that the contents of all the Video Game Packs, Anime Packs, Internet! Packs, and Rhythm Game Packs have been dramatically altered since [their first introduction in 2008](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1853). For the list of these beatmap packs in their legacy/original state, see [Legacy Beatmap Packs](/wiki/Medals/Legacy_beatmap_packs).

## Skill

**Skill medals** are medals awarded upon rounding off various skill-based accomplishments, be it by getting into certain [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) milestones, by attaining certain ranks in the [global performance point leaderboard](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/osu/performance), or by achieving either a clear or a [full combo](/wiki/Gameplay/Full_combo) on any [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified), [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked), or [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) beatmap within some certain [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) ranges.

## Dedication

**Dedication medals** are medals awarded upon reaching certain play count milestones in the osu! game mode, or by reaching total hit count milestones in osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania.

## Mod Introduction

*See also: [Game modifier](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier)*

**Mod Introduction medals** are medals awarded upon clearing any [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified), [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked), or [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) beatmap with their corresponding [game modifier (mod)](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier). These medals are meant to encourage newer players to try out each mod and explore what the game has to offer. Do note, however, that if players play with multiple game modifiers at a time, the player is **not** eligible to earn *any* of the game modifier medals for that play.

All Mod Introduction medals are eligible to be unlocked in any [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) unless otherwise specified.

## Hush-Hush

**Hush-Hush medals** are "secret" medals awarded for pulling off very specific feats, which are not explicitly told to the player (hence the name). These feats can range anywhere from completing a beatmap under peculiar circumstances to setting a score with an unusual mod combination. Despite their secretive nature, there are hints laying around to help all the curious medal hunters in their sleuth as follows:

- The names of the medals themselves,
- The medals' brief descriptions, and
- The *flair texts*<!-- https://twitter.com/ephemeralis/status/1068054191602638850 --> of the medals (if any), viewable by hovering over their corresponding cards.

As the Hush-Hush medals are meant to be secret achievements of some sort, the unlock requirements are not directly specified; however, players are [welcome to work together in order to figure out how to obtain all the Hush-Hush medals out there](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-08-17-new-hush-hush-medals).

There is also a subcategory called "Hush-Hush (Expert)". The difference is that medals in it do not allow usage of any [difficulty reduction](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) or [special](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#special) mods.

## Beatmap Spotlights

**Beatmap Spotlights medals** are medals awarded upon completion of certain beatmap packs released as part of the [Monthly Beatmap Spotlights](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-03-18-introducing-to-you-spotlights). In order to unlock the medals in this category, a player needs to play through all the maps *in any of the four game mode packs* that are being contested on the corresponding Beatmap Spotlights ranking chart. The following mods are permitted for use:

- [Difficulty reduction mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction)
- [Difficulty increase mods](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-increase)
- [xK](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/xK), [Mirror](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Mirror), and [Spun Out](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Spun_Out)

Although the Monthly Beatmap Spotlights have been discontinued as of April 2018 in favour of the [Seasonal Spotlights](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2018-11-01-beatmap-spotlights-summer-2018), all of the medals pertinent to it are still able to be obtained to this day.

## Beatmap Challenge Packs

**Beatmap Challenge Packs medals**, or alternatively referred to as [*Skill Packs medals*](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-11-20-featured-artist-beatmap-updates-from-the-mappers-guild#skill-packs), are medals awarded upon clearing the hardest difficulty present on all beatmaps featured in certain [Theme Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=theme) or [Artist/Album Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=artist) *without any [difficulty reduction](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) or [special](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#special) mods enabled*. These beatmap packs are specifically curated to test each player's comprehension of various gameplay aspects around a specific skill level, e.g. within a particular [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) or difficulty cap range.

All beatmaps in the pack have to be cleared in the [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) game mode in order to qualify for the medal unless otherwise specified.
