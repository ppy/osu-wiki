# Unlock requirements for Hush-Hush medals

The actual solutions of [Hush-Hush](/wiki/Medals#hush-hush) medals are intentionally omitted from this wiki to help preserve their secrecy. The community is encouraged to work together in order to find them.

There are, however, some general rules that the solutions tend to follow:

- A medal only appears in the profile of [game modes](/wiki/Game_mode) it can be obtained in.
- Medals can only be obtained on beatmaps that are either [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked), [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved), [Approved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) or [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified).
- Beatmap-specific medals are always related to songs from [Featured Artists](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists). This is a convention which has been emphasised more recently, so some older medals may be an exception to this rule.
- Medals in the "Hush-Hush (Expert)" subcategory do not allow usage of any [difficulty reduction](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) mods.
