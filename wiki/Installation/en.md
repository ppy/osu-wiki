# Installation

<!-- *See also: [Installation/OS X](/wiki/Installation/OS_X) and [Installation/Linux](/wiki/Installation/Linux)* -->

This page will roughly tell you how to get osu! working on your Windows device. The [osu!academy](/wiki/osu!academy) has a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLmWVQsxi34bMYwAawZtzuptfMmszUa_tl&v=cz522ZAs5aQ) that explains how to install osu! on Windows.

## Minimum system requirements

-   .NET framework 4+ (the installer should prompt you to download it, otherwise, you can [find it here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130))
-   A decent graphics card.

## Installing osu!

1.  Go to the [download page](/home/download) and download the installer.
2.  Locate and run the installer.
3.  While the installer is running, there is a ten second period to allow you to select the installation location.
    -   If you want to change it, click on the text underneath the word, "Hi!" and select the installation location.
    -   osu! will be installed to that location when the timer is done.
4.  When the installer is completed, osu! will start up right after. osu!direct will be used to download some starter beatmaps for you.
5.  osu! will prompt you to log in or register.
    -   If you have an account already, log in.
    -   If you need to sign up, see [Registration](/wiki/Registration), then log in.

## Adding beatmapsets

*See also: [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) and [Beatmapsets](/wiki/Beatmapsets)*

There are two ways to add beatmaps, via the website or osu!direct (requires [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter)).

### Website

1.  Go to the [beatmap listing page](/beatmapsets) and log into the website.
2.  Find a song you like to play.
3.  Click on the download icon to save the beatmapset on your computer.
4.  Locate and open the beatmapset file, it has an `.osz` extension.
    -   Alternatively, you can also place the beatmapset file into the `Songs` directory of the osu! installation.
5.  osu! will automatically handle the rest for you and load the beatmapset.
    -   If, for any reason, you do not see them, press `F5` in [Solo mode](/wiki/Solo_mode) to re-process your beatmaps.

### osu!direct

*Note: You need to have osu!supporter tag and internet connection to use osu!direct.*

1.  Open osu!, if you hadn't already.
2.  Find a song you like to play.
3.  Double click the the song on the list or click `Download` on the right to download it.
    -   If you do not want to download the video, click `DL NoVideo` instead.
4.  When osu! is done downloading the beatmapset, it will automatically load it if you are in Solo mode, at the [Song Selection](/wiki/Song_Selection) screen.
    -   If, for any reason, you do not see them, press `F5` in [Solo mode](/wiki/Solo_mode) to re-process your beatmaps.

## Adding skins

*See also: [Skins](/wiki/Skins) and [Skinning](/wiki/Skinning)*

1.  Go to the [skinning subforums](/community/forums/15) and find a skin you like.
2.  Once you find a skin, download it.
3.  Depending on how the skinner has packaged their skin, you may need to do different things.
    -   If the skin is using `.osk`:
        1.  Open it or drag and drop it into osu!.
        2.  osu! will process the skin and automatically select it for you.
    -   If the skin is compressed (using `.7z`, `.rar`, `.zip`, etc.):
        1.  Extract it.
        2.  Move the skin folder into the `Skins` directory of the osu! installation.
        3.  If osu! is opened, you may need to restart it before the skin can be used.
        4.  In osu!, go to the [Options](/wiki/Options) and search for `Skin`.
        5.  Scroll down to the `Current skin:` option and select the skin you have downloaded.
