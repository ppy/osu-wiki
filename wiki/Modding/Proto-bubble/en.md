# Proto-bubble

The **proto-bubble** (***pubble***) was a forum post icon used by members of the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (*MAT*) in previous iterations of the [beatmap ranking process](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). It was designed to indicate [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) believed to be of a suitably high quality for [ranking](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked) by members of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (*BAT*), who could then place a full bubble<!-- TODO: bubble stub --> icon if the beatmap met their approval.

The proto-bubble was retired on the 23rd of April, 2013, with the dissolution of the MAT and the promotion of all current team members to the BAT.
