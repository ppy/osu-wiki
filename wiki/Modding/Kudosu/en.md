# Kudosu

**Kudosu** is a reward system for [modding](/wiki/Modding). It awards points for successful mod posts in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion). Accumulated points can be seen on a user's profile page.

In forum modding, kudosu was exchangeable for [star priority](/wiki/Glossary#star-priority).

The word *kudosu*, sometimes stylised as *kudosu!*, is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of *kudos* and *osu!*.
