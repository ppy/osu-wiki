# Kudosu

**Kudosu** is a reward system for [modding](/wiki/Modding). It awards points for successful mod posts in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion). Accumulated points can be seen on a user's profile page.

Kudosu is awarded to mod posts that are helpful and point out useful suggestions for the beatmap. If a mapper believes that a mod post is useful and addresses a valid issue, they can click the thumbs up button and award kudosu to the user who posted the mod.

In [forum modding](/wiki/Modding/Forum_modding), kudosu used to be exchangeable for [star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority).

Nowadays, kudosu is used for the evaluation of a user's capability to [become](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Becoming_a_Beatmap_Nominator) a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators). A user must have 200 kudosu in osu! or 150 kudosu in osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania in order to apply.

The word *kudosu*, sometimes stylized as *kudosu!*, is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of *kudos* and *osu!*.

### History and Forum Usage
Originally, kudosu was a way to measure a user's contribution in beatmap discussions, with the goal of improving the quality of the game through modding suggestions. Over time, the kudosu system was refined to more accurately reflect the value of users' contributions. At one point, kudosu was exchanged for [star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority), a benefit that allowed users with more kudosu to get their beatmaps ranked faster, receiving more attention from other members of the community. This system helped accelerate the process of ranking beatmaps so they could be evaluated and eventually included in the game.

### Evaluation of Applications and BN Ranking Systems
Currently, kudosu plays an important role in evaluating users who want to become a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators). To qualify as a BN, a user needs to achieve 200 kudosu in osu! or 150 kudosu in osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania. Kudosu serves as an indicator of the user's experience and ability to effectively evaluate and modify beatmaps.

Additionally, kudosu was also used in ranking systems for [Beatmap Nominators](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators#Ranking) to classify the experience and authority of nominators within the community. These ranking systems allowed more experienced users with significant kudosu to have greater influence on the selection of beatmaps for inclusion in the game.

### How It Works in Beatmap Discussions
In [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion), kudosu functions as a form of recognition for helpful contributions. When a user posts a mod that offers valuable suggestions for improving a beatmap, the mapper can grant kudosu to the mod. This recognition can help mappers decide which modifications should be implemented in their beatmaps and allows more experienced users to stand out in the modding process.
