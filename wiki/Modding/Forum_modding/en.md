# Forum modding

**Forum modding**, also known as *Modding v1*, is a colloquial name of the forum-based [modding](/wiki/Modding) and ranking system that was mainly used until [November 4, 2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/650961?n=7), when all new and inactive [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) were switched to [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion) by default.

In the forum modding system, every beatmap had a forum thread for communication and logging of the [ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

## Beatmap thread

A forum thread was created for a beatmap during its initial [submission](/wiki/Beatmapping/Beatmap_submission) and contained free-form comments, guest difficulty interactions, and structured feedback in form of mod posts. It served as the main hub for discussion between all users interested in the beatmap: regular players, the [beatmap host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_host), [guest mappers](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty), [modders](/wiki/Modding/Modder), and members of these beatmap ranking teams:

- [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (*BAT*)
- [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/People/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (*MAT*)
- [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) (*QAT*)
- [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) (*BN*)

A forum thread was automatically moved between different forum sections loosely tied to the [beatmap categories](/wiki/Beatmap/Category):

- [Works In Progress/Help](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/10)
- [Pending Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/6)
- [Ranked Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/14)
- [Beatmap Graveyard](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/19)

### Star priority

*Main article: [Star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority)*

In every subforum, beatmap threads were sorted by their star priority, which had several purposes:

- 12 star priority was required before a beatmap could receive a [bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble).
- Some modders and members of the BAT relied on star priority when deciding which map to mod or review next.
- Star priority was a rough measure of a beatmap's popularity among modders and mappers.

The priority of a beatmap could be increased by mods receiving kudosu or users shooting kudosu stars. In modern [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion), star priority is comparable to a beatmap's [hype](/wiki/Beatmap/Hype) count.

### Thread icons

The beatmap's progress in the ranking procedure was shown through posts made by members of beatmap ranking teams. Each post had a custom icon, which would also change the forum thread's icon to reflect its status:

- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/star.gif) **[Star](/wiki/Disambiguation/Star)**: the beatmap had potential to become ranked.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble.gif) **[Bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble)**: the beatmap had been checked by a member of the MAT, BAT, or BN, and might be ranked after another check.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble-pop.gif) **[Bubble pop](/wiki/Modding/Bubble#bubble-pop)**: the beatmap had issues that prevented it from being ranked after receiving a bubble.
- ![](img/icon/osu.gif) ![](img/icon/taiko.gif) ![](img/icon/ctb.gif) ![](img/icon/mania.gif) **Game mode icon**: the difficulties of the beatmap's respective [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) were checked and approved by a BN.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/heart.gif) **[Heart](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked)** or ![](/wiki/shared/icon/flame.gif) **[flame](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved)**: the beatmap had been qualified, ranked or approved.
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/broken-heart.gif) **Broken heart**: the beatmap had been disqualified or unranked due to severe composition issues or lack of compliance to the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria).
- ![](/wiki/shared/icon/nuke.gif) **[Nuke](/wiki/Modding/Nuke)**: the beatmap could not be even considered for rank in its current state.

## Communication

### Mod

Unlike in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion), a typical forum mod post covered the whole beatmap and could contain a lot of content. While users were free to express their thoughts in any form they wished, the majority of modders adhered to a specific structure to make their posts more readable:

- There were several sections corresponding to single difficulties and a list of beatmap-wide settings/issues.
- Each section contained a list of [timestamps](/wiki/Modding/Timestamp), often pointing to specific [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object).
- Each timestamp was followed by a short description of the issue, sometimes with screenshots to further clarify a concern.
- Based on the severity of the issue, some modders used [colour coding](/wiki/BBCode#colour) in their post to highlight unrankable issues or key points.

The modern *review* system was created to mimic forum modding in beatmap discussions.

### Response

While not required, mappers were expected to reply to every mod received. A reply typically contained a quote of the original post, where every suggestion was followed by a mapper's response. As with mod posts, many mappers used two or more font colours to convey their responses and help distinguish between accepted and rejected suggestions.

### Kudosu

*Main article: [Kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu)*

If a mod post was deemed useful, the mapper or a member of the QAT/BAT/BN could award it with kudosu. According to an unwritten rule, only a user's first mod post was eligible to gain kudosu. Regardless of how many suggestions were in a post or how useful it was to the mapper, the amount of kudosu received was consistent:

- 1 kudosu, under most circumstances.
- 2 kudosu, in case the beatmap thread was inactive for more than a week. This was supposed to promote modding on older maps.

Kudosu served as an activity metric for modders. Most users spent their accumulated kudosu to increase [star priority](/wiki/Modding/Star_priority) of the maps they liked or wanted to promote.

## Deprecation

In the forum-based modding system, a lot of actions were manual, which often led to mistakes. Examples:

- The mapper's feedback could be missing.
- Mods could be partially or completely ignored, intentionally or not.
- Maps could be ranked with unrankable issues, or without the approval of mode-specific nominator(s).

The changes required to address most common issues were initiated on [April 26, 2013](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/129625), when [peppy](/wiki/People/peppy) presented the idea of the [new modding system](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion) (later known as *Modding v2*). On [August 21, 2014](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2014-08-21-restructuring-of-the-bat), a new category, [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#qualified), was added. Qualified would serve as a buffer between pending and ranked beatmaps and allow for more smooth unranks. In addition to that, a new team, [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) (*QAT*), was assembled to check qualified beatmaps and control the ranking process.

Afterwards, the beatmap discussion system and the [code of conduct for modding and mapping](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_conduct_for_modding_and_mapping) were developed and made available to restructure modding and make it a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved:

- [April 11, 2016](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/442285): Beatmap discussions were enabled for two beatmaps and made available for public testing.
- [February 1, 2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/552250): After several more months of development based on collected feedback, the next version of the discussion system was enabled for another, larger set of beatmaps.
- [November 4, 2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/650961?n=7): Beatmap discussions were enabled for all beatmaps that were newly submitted or had zero forum replies.
