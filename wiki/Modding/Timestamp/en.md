# Timestamp

**Timestamps** are used in [modding](/wiki/Modding) to refer to times or [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). When posted on [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion), they create special links that can be used to easily jump to that point in the [editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor).

Copying (`Ctrl` + `C`) a selection of hit objects in the editor will put a timestamp on the clipboard. The time in the bottom-left can also be clicked on and copied.

## Format

Timestamp syntax: `minutes:seconds:milliseconds (combo numbers)`  
Link syntax: `osu://edit/timestamp`

`minutes` and `seconds` are padded to 2 digits, and `milliseconds` is padded to 3. `combo numbers` are optional and separated by commas.

### Example

For a reference to objects 5 and 6 at 12 seconds and 34 milliseconds into a map:

Timestamp: `00:12:034 (5,6)`  
Link: `osu://edit/00:12:034 (5,6)`
