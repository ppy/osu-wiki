### Mapping with Rewards

Mapping with Rewards are announced on [peppy's blog](http://blog.ppy.sh/). Unlike the [#Monthly Beatmapping Contest](#Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest)— which runs a contest for <u>any</u> song(s)— mapping with rewards runs a beatmapping contest with <u>official osu!songs</u> from osu!artists, like cYsmix.

Some remarks about mapping with rewards (and some differences with [#Monthly Beatmapping Contest](#Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest)):

-   submissions are subject to last minute judgement
    -   peppy is the judge

-   no set deadline
-   ranked beatmaps of the requested songs may also subject for judgement
-   no mode specific maps (you can map any mode)
-   must be non-collab
-   single game mode (no TAG diffs)
-   preselected background images (current, if any, background images will be replaced)
