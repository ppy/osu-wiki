# ppv1

The **first performance score** (abbreviated as **ppv1**) is an ancient ranking system for players globally and nationally of all modes from osu!. It replaced the old system of *ranking by total score* and was abandoned for the benefit of [ppv2](../ "ppv2").

## History

ppv1 was launched in April 2012 and initially mentioned in the players profiles under the name ``???`` during a test phase. Then finally renamed to **pp** (performance points) on 17. April 2012. This system existed with the previous ranking system (by total score) and eventually became the unique system in place on 24. July 2012 during the release of the version [20120722-24](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/1687719 "20120722-24") of the osu! client.


This system was initially updated at regular intervals, usually every 24 hours, to finally run in real-time on 16. August 2012.

ppv1 was abandoned and replaced by **ppv2** on 27 January 2014.
The reasons behind that change were the criticism of the players:

* Missing opacity of the algorithm
* Promotion of ``Hard`` difficulties with mods
* Low worth of insane difficulties

It also allowed peppy to seperate the job of maintaining and updating the filing system to and thus ease its workload.

## Algorithm

The calculations involved are not publicly known, however some indications on the inner workings of the system were disclosed:

- ppv1 highlights the skill and can not be farmed.
- The score is evaluated in relation to the difficulty of the map, based on statistics that were not available to the public.
- The number of points obtainable naturally decreases with time (thus, inactive players may loose up to half of his points within a year).
- No penalties for bad scores, only rewards for good scores.
- All *ranked* and *approved* maps are taken into account in the calculations.
- The accuracy is taken into account.
- The multipliers of mods are different from those announced in the game.
- Mode specific difficulties are favored.
- If a score is not placed in the top 500 of a map, it will not count.

## Climbing the rankings

The ranking is mainly related to the performance on individual maps, resulting in players to only focussing and mastering single difficulties.

- Playing better and scoring better grades on the beatmaps.
- Making sure to get some very good scores rather than thousands of mediocre scores.
- Improving the accuracy. Even a small percent can make the difference.
- Getting a rank on the most popular maps, where it is harder to get a place.
- Playing difficult maps.
- Improving old scores.
- Geting SS grades.
