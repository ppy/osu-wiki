# General Information

Are you a Beatmap Nominator, or are interested in becoming one? Then you have come to the right place! This article is all the general information you will need to know as a new Beatmap Nominator. To start, this article will start with a few useful links and then introduce you to the way icons are used, as well as how this transitions into [Beatmap Discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussions) (also known as Modding v2).

## Useful Information

First off, take note of the [Beatmap Nominator Rules](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominator_Rules), which outlines both how to undertake various actions such as iconing maps, as well as how not to do things - you would want to avoid breaking these in any situation, so be sure to read them carefully! You can always ask a member of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) if you are unsure about something, and we will be happy to help.

Next, there's the [Code of Conduct for Mapping and Modding](/wiki/CoC). As a Beatmap Nominator, you are expected to be an exemplary figure of the community, someone others look up to and respect, so misconduct may get you reprimanded or even expelled. This also includes parts of the ranking process as well - do not go around nominating maps in which the mapper has ignored mods, for example.

Moreover, as a Beatmap Nominator, you have the opportunity to join a Nominator Subdivision. These provide an opportunity to collaborate in small groups, discuss potential problems with your peers, or gain a fresh perspective. Joining a Subdivision is highly recommended for new Beatmap Nominators to ensure you can always ask for help and guidance when necessary. You can find more information on how these work in this document.

Lastly, the information you will probably be referencing the most, the Ranking Criteria. If you are already a Beatmap Nominator, then you should be familiar with this. Essentially, it serves to explain what aspects of mapping are and are not allowed in the Ranked section, as well as including some general guidelines that people should try to follow in most cases. If you see a Qualified map breaking one of the rules, or feel that it could still use substantial improvement for whatever reason, feel free to report it in this thread, giving a brief outline of the problems you see.

For beatmaps with subjective quality concerns that don't necessarily break the rules and guidelines of the Ranking Criteria, but which you feel which make the beatmap in question unfit for the Ranked section, the [_beatmap veto_](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Veto) allows you to withhold a beatmap from Qualification.

## Beatmap Nominator Icons

Icons are the evidence of a Beatmap Nominator's efforts when checking maps, and though there are many on offer to you, these are the relevant ones to take note of:

### ![bubble icon](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble.gif) Bubble

**This icon represents the first nomination.** As is with any icon on modding v1, the beatmapset must have at least 12 star priority before allowing you to place this. In Beatmap Discussions (Modding v2), the mapset must have at least 5 Hype and no currently unresolved Problem stamps. Make sure you're satisfied with all difficulties, even other game modes, before placing this. If the beatmapset was previously vetoed, you must also exhaustively explain why the reason for the veto should not prevent the map from moving forward.

### ![heart icon](/wiki/shared/icon/heart.gif) Heart

**This is an icon used to represent a qualification; the second nomination.** You may only use this icon as a full nominator. Before qualifying a map, make sure the bubble post, or first nomination, was at least 24 hours ago. In order to qualify a modding v1 map, first go into "Manage" on the beatmap listing page, then click on "Qualify" and confirm. Once this is done, place the heart icon on the thread. Qualifying will automatically place the icon on the thread, but you should also place it yourself in a new post for logging reasons. You cannot qualify more than 3 maps per day, so doing it in this order is also safer.

In Beatmap Discussions (Modding v2), the second nomination can be placed the same way as the first, but must still follow the 24 hour rule mentioned above. For maps with Beatmap Discussions enabled, do not manually qualify, as this automatically happens once the second nomination is placed.

### ![bubble pop icon](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble-pop.gif) Bubble Pop

**This is a special icon used to represent a reset of nominations after a beatmap has been nominated, but before it has been Qualified.** The icon is usually used when there is a major issue in the beatmap which should be addressed before considering it for ranking. If something is unrankable, for example, you should place this icon together with pointing out the issue clearly. In Beatmap Discussions (Modding v2), this status is automatically achieved when a Nominator posts a Problem stamp on an already nominated beatmap.

As an extension of this icon, you can also veto a beatmap, preventing the previous Nominator from renominating it until you give permission. However, this also requires that you discuss the issue with the mapper properly and try to reach a consensus, as well as letting the original Nominator know that it is vetoed in some way (often by stating it in the post). If no consensus can be made, the mapper must find another Nominator. Discussing the issue with the original Nominator would be beneficial and might grant you a new perspective on the matter, but you're not obligated to do so.

### ![broken heart icon](/wiki/shared/icon/broken-heart.gif) Broken Heart

**This icon represents a nomination reset after the map has been Qualified; a disqualification.** As a Nominator, you are not allowed to use this icon under any circumstances. If this was by a placed by a Quality Assurance Team member referencing concerns from the community, the respective community members must first give permission before allowing the two Nominators to renominate. Like the veto, other Nominators can still nominate in these cases.

### ![flame icon](/wiki/shared/icon/flame.gif) Flame

**This icon was once used to qualify approval maps, but is now deprecated.** Use the heart icon for this instead.

### ![star icon](/wiki/shared/icon/star.gif) Star

**This icon does and means absolutely nothing.** Historically this icon has often been used to show interest in a map, but not necessarily that a nomination would follow. This icon has no Beatmap Discussions (Modding v2) equivalent.

### ![nuke icon](/wiki/shared/icon/nuke.gif) Nuke

**Nuke icons are placed on mapsets that are considered to be in an irreparable state, unable to ever be ranked.** As a Nominator you are not allowed to use this icon under any circumstances. This icon has no Beatmap Discussions (Modding v2) equivalent.

Note: Any available icon's Beatmap Discussion equivalent often inherits the rules of the icon, so you may still only place the second nomination as a full member of the Beatmap Nominators, for example.
