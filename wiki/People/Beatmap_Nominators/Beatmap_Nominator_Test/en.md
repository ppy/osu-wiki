# Beatmap Nominator Test

The **Beatmap Nominator Test** was an examination used to aid evaluation of [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) (*BN*) applicants. It was deprecated in March 2024 with the introduction of a reformed application system.[^test-deprecated]

Users applying to the Beatmap Nominators were required to take a test through the [Beatmap Nominator website](https://bn.mappersguild.com/). Once a user took the test, its results would be made visible to members of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (*NAT*) and helped indicate a user's capability of joining the BN.

## Older tests

[Echo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/431) created a prototype for the first modding test in 2008; however, it was not used for new BN (previously known as [Beatmap Approval Team](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (*BAT*)) applicants. Users were expected to point out mistakes in an intentionally flawed beatmap, [Arashi - Kitto Daijoubu](http://up.ppy.sh/files/Arashi%20-%20Kitto%20Daijoubu.rar).

Similar modding puzzles were created for fun until 2015, when the first Beatmap Nominator test was created for practical use. The test featured a multiple choice section similar to the last form of the BN test, as well as a hands-on modding puzzle created by [Charles445](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/85000). The modding test beatmap featured 10 difficulties with short mapped segments. Each segment was assigned a [difficulty level](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) and issues were expected to be found given that context.

The second test (created by [Irreversible](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964) and [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515)), the third test (created by Irreversible, Mao, and [Myxo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202645)), and the fourth test (created by Irreversible and Mao) were designed as full beatmap spreads. These aimed to give the impression of modding a real beatmap.

These practical modding tests were used to help determine new Beatmap Nominators until 2017, when they were discontinued due to concerns with cheating. After 2017, new BN admissions were handled through subjective judgement from the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) (*QAT*), and later the NAT.

## Latest test structure

There were 20 questions on the last version of the test, and applicants taking the test were expected to select all correct answers from a list of choices. Each question is worth 1 point, and answering questions incorrectly would have awarded a user fewer points or no points, but it would not have resulted in points being deducted from the user's overall total.

Test questions were pulled from a large pool of questions sorted by category. The following categories appeared in the test:

- [Beatmap Nominator Rules](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules): 5 questions
- [Mapping and Modding Code of Conduct](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_conduct_for_modding_and_mapping): 1 question
- [General Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#general) (*RC*): 1 question
- [Spread RC](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#beatmap): 1 question
- [Metadata RC](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/Metadata): 1 question
- [Timing RC](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#timing): 1 question
- [Audio RC](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#audio): 1 question
- [Video and Background RC](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#video-and-background): 1 question
- [Skinning RC](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#skinning): 1 question
- [Storyboarding RC](/wiki/Ranking_criteria#storyboarding): 3 questions
- Mode-specific RC: 4 questions specific to the game mode applied to (osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, osu!mania)

For osu! applications, a score below 12.5 would have resulted in a failed application. For other game modes, there was no threshold for passing or failing the BN test; however, it was generally accepted that a score above 15 is good, a score between 12.5 and 15 is mediocre, and any scores lower than 12.5 were concerning.

The test had no time limit, and applicants were expected to read relevant wiki pages while taking the test.
