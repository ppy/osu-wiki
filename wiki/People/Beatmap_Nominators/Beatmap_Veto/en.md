# Beatmap veto

The *beatmap veto* allows a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) to withhold a beatmap from ranking if they feel there are significant issues regarding beatmap quality which make it unfit for the [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) section. Seeking further discussion or clarification over any kind of quality issues which they feel need to be addressed before the map can proceed with [Qualification](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#qualification) is one of their main responsibilities.

Any Beatmap Nominator (BN) or member of the Nomination Assessment Team may place a beatmap veto, provided they are formally qualified for the game mode(s) in question, as stated in the [Beatmap Nominator Rules](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules). Each beatmap veto must be discussed by both parties — the mapper as well as the Nominator placing the beatmap veto — in an attempt to reach an agreed compromise.

In cases where discussion does not take place or is inconclusive, and either the mapper or vetoing Nominator requests it, members of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (NAT) will initiate and oversee a mediation to either uphold or dismiss the veto. The mediation vote is held anonymously among the Beatmap Nominators and members of the NAT of a given game mode. Once voting has completed, the reasoning from each participant is revealed along with the mediation result in the beatmap discussion.

## Initiating a beatmap veto

As a Beatmap Nominator, you can initiate the process of vetoing a beatmap by clicking `Submit anonymous veto` on [the BN Management website's Vetoes page](https://bn.mappersguild.com/vetoes) and filling out the prompts to submit a pending veto. This includes a thorough explanation of the reason(s) for the veto. NAT members may submit pending vetoes in the same way. Pending vetoes are only visible to BN and NAT members.

Once this pending veto is submitted, two Beatmap Nominators must vouch for it in order to veto the beatmap. Vouching for a veto is an indication of support for the veto, and is considered equivalent to submitting a veto writeup. NAT members **cannot** vouch for vetoes.

Once a veto writeup has been vouched for by two Beatmap Nominators, the relevant beatmap is considered vetoed, and the [Nomination Assessment Team bot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6616586) will post to the affected map's discussion about it, stating the reason(s) for the veto.

## Discussion

Once a beatmap is vetoed, the vetoers (users who submitted and vouched for the veto), as well as the beatmap's creator and any guest difficulty creators whose difficulties are affected, are invited to a private veto chatroom. Additionally, members of the NAT have access to view and delete messages in the chatroom in order to moderate it.

All users in the private veto chatroom are anonymous to begin with<!--though I think this will be changed very soon -->, but a user may choose to reveal their identity at any time.

The vetoers are expected to discuss the reasons for the veto with the mapper(s) and try to reach a compromise. If the mapper thinks they have made sufficient changes to resolve the vetoers' concerns, they may initiate a vote to dismiss the veto. The vetoers will be prompted to vote to uphold or dismiss the veto. If two of the three vetoers vote to dismiss the veto, the veto is dismissed, and the beatmap may be ranked.

If discussion is no longer progressing in the direction of a compromise, or is otherwise unable to be reasonably resolved, the mapper(s) or vetoers may request veto mediation, although two vetoers must request mediation for it to be initiated. This option is made available after 24 hours to allow time for discussion.

## Veto mediation

If veto mediation is initiated, two groups of Beatmap Nominators, each consisting of 15% of the relevant mode's Beatmap Nominators with a minimum of 5 Beatmap Nominators per group, will be selected and asked to vote to agree or disagree with each veto point. Any Beatmap Nominators that vote may add an anonymous comment to explain their vote. 

Additionally, **any user may vote** to agree or disagree with each veto point, **even if they are not a Beatmap Nominator**. All users who were not Beatmap Nominators selected to vote are considered a third group of voters. Users in this group may not provide comments to go along with their votes.

Mediation voting lasts 7 days. Once it is done, the votes are tallied. If a 60% majority within a group agrees with a veto point, that group will be considered to agree with the veto point; otherwise, the group will be considered to disagree with the veto point.

For a veto point to be upheld, at least two of the three groups must agree with what is stated. If this threshold is not reached, the veto point is dismissed.

## Post-mediation procedure

Following mediation, the beatmap veto will either be dismissed if all veto points were dismissed, or upheld if one or more of the veto points were upheld.

### Dismissed beatmap vetoes

**If the beatmap veto is dismissed**, any formally qualified Beatmap Nominator may renominate the beatmap, including the Nominator(s) who initially nominated.

### Upheld beatmap vetoes

**If the beatmap veto is upheld**, the beatmap may not be re-nominated until appropriate changes are made that remedy the issues present.

Once changes are made to the beatmap, the Nominator performing the beatmap veto will be called to recheck the beatmap and decide if the issues have been satisfactorily addressed.

## Challenging a beatmap veto<!--I don't know how this will work, but the jury will definitely be changed.-->

If a beatmap veto is upheld, the mapper may request another mediation if they meet the following criteria:

- The latest veto mediation has been concluded for at least a year.
- The beatmap currently has 2 Beatmap Nominators who are willing to nominate it, in case the veto is dismissed later.

To request a new mediation, the mapper must contact a member of the NAT corresponding to the game mode of the vetoed beatmap. Said request should include a link to the initial mediation conclusion post and the names of the 2 BNs who are willing to nominate the beatmap. The NAT will then contact the 2 BNs, and if there are no issues, the NAT will re-initiate the mediation with special conditions:

- The jury will consist of every member of the BN/NAT corresponding to the game mode of the vetoed beatmap.
- The mediation will last for 2 weeks.

**If the veto is dismissed**, the 2 BNs mentioned above may nominate the beatmap. If said BNs are no longer willing to nominate, their position as Beatmap Nominators may be questioned as a result.

**If the veto is upheld**, the beatmap may not be re-nominated until appropriate changes are made that remedy the issues present, and the beatmap may not be eligible for another mediation unless the above criteria are fulfilled again.
