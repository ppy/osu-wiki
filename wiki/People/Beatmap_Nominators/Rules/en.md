# Rules

The rules listed here affect what Beatmap Nominators can and cannot do when nominating beatmaps as well as set the tone for the general conduct expected from them.

These rules are the result of discussion within the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) and have taken into account feedback from the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) upon their proposal.

Beatmap Nominators possess the tools to nominate beatmaps and shape the world of osu! by promoting new content towards being included in the official listings, for this reason they have to abide by the following rules at all times:

## Rules

Rules are exactly that: **rules.** Violating any of these may get the respective Beatmap Nominator removed permanently from the Beatmap Nominators.

Violations of those rules may be reported to a member of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) directly.

### General

+ **__Every__ mapset is approved through two nominations.** Other factors such as the mapset itself being a Marathon, a normal spread or its length do not matter, the amount of nominations required in order to move it to the Qualified section remains at two. More nominations than necessary must not be done.
+ **Do not nominate beatmap sets that you contributed to.** This applies to your own maps, collaboration difficulties you participate in as well as beatmaps that you hitsounded or made a storyboard for.
+ **Do not nominate a map directly without any communication with the mapper.** The mapper might have done self-changes after the last icon, so nominating a mapset without communicating with the mapper can lead to pointless disqualifications.
+ **Do not qualify beatmaps of modes which you are not a full member of, unless they were nominated by someone who is.** This ensures that a full nominator is always part of the process for each mode.
+ **Hybrid beatmapsets must be nominated by full nominators from two of its modes in order to be qualified**, as well as gain clear approval from any remaining modes' nominators in the modding discussion. This means only full members may nominate hybrid sets, and ensures that a full nominator takes responsibility for each mode (regardless of nominating or just giving approval in the discussion).
+ **Do not nominate beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You must be qualified to nominate at least one of the game modes included in the mapset by being a member of the respective part of the Beatmap Nominators in order to be allowed to nominate it.
+ **Do not veto beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You are not allowed to nominate them so blocking a nomination without the ability to renominate the beatmap makes no sense.
+ **Do not nominate maps with unrankable issues.** The General Ranking Criteria and additionally all mode-specific Ranking Criteria apply to all sets with mode-specific difficulties.
+ **Do not qualify mapsets whose song already has a Qualified mapset, unless no game modes of both sets overlap - this includes remixed versions**. For example an osu!taiko and osu! mapset of the same song can exist in the Qualified section, whilst an osu!taiko and osu!/osu!taiko hybrid set cannot. This ensures variety among Ranked beatmaps within their respective game modes.
+ **If a bubbled map contains unrankable issues, its bubble must be popped.** This applies even if you do not intend to nominate the mapset.
+ **Do not qualify over any manually popped bubble set by another Beatmap Nominator.** Manually popping bubble resets the bubble counter to zero, so doing this is equivalent to directly qualifying a beatmap without any prior icons.
+ **Make sure no mod posts in the map thread have been ignored before qualifying or bubbling a map.** Posts without a sufficient reply may count as ignored. When in doubt, double check if the Code of Conduct for Mapping and Modding has been violated on the mapthread and act accordingly.
+ **Do not partake or participate in paid modding, ranking OR beatmapping commissions.** There should never be any question as to the legitimacy or motives of members of any "official" osu! team (BN, QAT or otherwise) involved in the ranking process.
+ **Disqualifications should primarily be done for beatmaps with unrankable issues, or if the mapset owner requests it.** 
+ **Qualified beatmaps found with unrankable issues must first be posted to the [Report a Beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/447428) thread.** If the issue has already been reported by someone else, then you are free to disqualify the beatmap. Beatmaps should not be disqualified without at least two people confirming the issue.
+ **Disqualification requests by the mapset owner can be applied immediately.** 
+ **For non-unrankable issues or concerns, the mapper should be given time until 24 hours before estimated rank time to respond.** If the mapper fails to respond, the beatmap may be disqualified for further discussion.  This does not apply to posts made less than 48 hours before the estimated rank date of the beatmap set, to give mappers ample time to reply and decide whether to make changes.
+ **Disqualification posts must contain a short reason for the disqualification, as well as links to any related issues posted in the beatmap discussions.** This includes requested disqualifications; simply writing that it was requested is not enough.
+ **Ensure that you are looking at the most up to date version of the beatmap before disqualifying.** 
+ **Beatmaps qualified in modding v1 that need to be disqualified should be brought to the attention of the NAT.** 
+ **Issues that can be mitigated through online offsets, tags or similar must still be disqualified.** In the case that this is not possible, contact a member of the NAT. Online offsets and tags only apply for the website, so players will still have the issues in the client unless fixed before ranked.
+ **Only full members may disqualify beatmaps, regardless of reason.** Probation members may however still participate in such discussions and report beatmaps like everyone else.


### Conduct

+ **Do not follow any unfinalized rules or amendments.**
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you are unsure of something.** In such cases, ask fellow nominators for assistance before making any rushed decisions. This includes unfamiliar game modes, suspiciously gray area/unrankable issues, quality issues or complex timing.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you cannot reasonably judge it.** Being able to reasonably evaluate a beatmap, either through playtesting or modding experience, is a core part of being able to judge a beatmap’s quality. If you are deemed not to have sufficient playing skill or modding experience, we may call your ability to judge the map into question.
+ **Do not qualify a beatmap if any significant changes were made since it was bubbled.** These may include fixing unrankable issues, changes in object snapping, major changes in flow or object placement, alterations to a song’s timing, etc. When in doubt, such beatmaps must be rebubbled first.
+ **Ensure that kudosu is awarded to all posts that deserve it.** Additionally consult the mapper before giving out kudosu to make sure there are not any reasons why the post does not need kudosu (e.g. the modder has received one already for a different post which you overlooked). If the modpost is too old to receive kudosu, consult the modder to make an additional post linking the original he receives kudosu for.
+ **You must not place any icons besides the star, bubble, bubble pop and heart.** Whilst you are able to set other icons, they are either deprecated and discouraged from use (flame, circle, drum, apple, piano) or reserved for use by the Quality Assurance Team (nuke). If you accidentally set an unwanted icon, contact a QAT immediately or overwrite the icon in case you wanted to post a bubble or heart.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap without properly checking all difficulties of the beatmap all by yourself.** If you are unfamiliar with the game mode some of the difficulties are mapped in, ask fellow Nominators for help. Improper checking includes just running a modding tool before nominating or not even downloading the beatmap.
+ **You can veto a qualified beatmap set by posting the issues you think need to be addressed before reaching Ranked status, and then contacting a member of the QAT.** You must participate in the resulting discussion and attempt to reach a mutual agreement. The following conditions must be met before the veto is applied and the set is disqualified, however:
  + The veto post must include a clear problem and reasoning for pausing the beatmap set's ranking process.
  + Unless the beatmap set reaches Ranked status in less than 1 day, the veto post must be at least 1 day old to allow for observation of test plays and additional feedback.
  + The beatmap set must have been in qualified for at least 2 days in total between all qualifications.
Additional time in qualified may be requested by the vetoing nominator, or applied as deemed necessary by the QAT, so long as the mapper does not request a disqualification themselves.
+ **You must not renominate a map in which your nomination was vetoed, unless the respective vetoing nominator agrees to that action or the veto was dismissed through QAT mediation.** Beatmap Nominators may no longer overrule a beatmap veto, and must instead re-initiate mediation with the beatmap veto passing a dismissal before both they and the initial Beatmap Nominator can nominate (should they wish to do so).
+ **You are free to pop a rebubble of another nominator if you are not the original bubble popper and disagree with the reasoning for disregarding the bubble pop.** Thus the original popper is unable to overvote two other nominators.
+ **If the community member(s) requesting disqualification cannot reach an agreement with the mapper and you placed the last bubble or heart on a map, you cannot rebubble or requalify it.** For osu!taiko, osu!catch, osu!mania, and hybrid sets, you may break these conditions once per map due to the low number of nominators.
+ **Abide by the [osu! Community Rules](/wiki/Rules) and the [Code of Conduct for Modding and Mapping](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct) at all times.** As a Beatmap Nominator, your behaviour should serve as a positive example to other members of the community. Infringing upon the Code of Conduct may result in you being placed on a temporary probation, or in extreme cases, removal from the Beatmap Nominators.

## Changelog
This section lists recent addition to this ruleset as well as rules that are in the process of transition and may be handled differently for a certain time. This interval as well as additional information, where available, is listed in _italics_.

+ **Do not nominate beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You must be qualified to nominate at least one of the game modes included in the mapset by being a member of the respective part of the Beatmap Nominators in order to be allowed to nominate it.

_Addition date: 2017-04-06, **in effect immediately**_
+ **__Every__ mapset is approved through two nominations** Other factors such as the mapset itself being a Marathon, a normal spread or its length do not matter, the amount of nominations required in order to move it to the Qualified section remains at two. More nominations than necessary must not be done.

_Addition date: 2. June 2017, **in effect immediately**_
+ **At least 24 hours must pass between a first nomination and a qualification on every mapset, *ignoring renominations for minor changes.*** This gives other Beatmap Nominators and also the wider community the chance to provide additional suggestions before qualification and veto the placed nomination if necessary.

_Change date: 2. Feb 2018, **in effect immediately**_
+ **Do not qualify any beatmap if you are not yet a full member of the Beatmap Nominators, *unless it was nominated by someone who is.*** This ensures that a full nominator is always part of the process. New nominators become full members after 1-2 months depending on how they did in that period.

_Change date: 2. March 2018, **in effect immediately**_
+ **You can veto a beatmap set by placing a bubble pop icon or a problem stamp on the set that you disagree with being fit for being Ranked.** Placing a beatmap veto over any kind of quality issues that you think need to be addressed before the map can move anywhere is one of your main responsibilities. A proper discussion with attempting to reach a mutual agreement by both sides of the argument has to follow.
+ **You must not renominate a map in which your nomination was vetoed, unless the respective vetoing nominator agrees to that action or the veto was dismissed through QAT mediation.** Beatmap Nominators may no longer overrule a beatmap veto, and must instead re-initiate mediation with the beatmap veto passing a dismissal before both they and the initial Beatmap Nominator can nominate (should they wish to do so).

_Change date: 12. April 2018, **in effect immediately**_
+ **Do not partake or participate in paid modding, ranking OR beatmapping commissions.** There should never be any question as to the legitimacy or motives of members of any "official" osu! team (BN, QAT or otherwise) involved in the ranking process.

_Change date: 12. Dec 2018, **in effect immediately**_

+ **Disqualifications should primarily be done for beatmaps with unrankable issues, or if the mapset owner requests it.** 
+ **Qualified beatmaps found with unrankable issues must first be posted to the [Report a Beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/447428) thread.** If the issue has already been reported by someone else, then you are free to disqualify the beatmap. Beatmaps should not be disqualified without at least two people confirming the issue.
+ **Disqualification requests by the mapset owner can be applied immediately.** 
+ **For more subjective issues or concerns, waiting for a mapper’s reply is preferable if the map still stays in qualified section for more than 24 hours.** In case there is very little time left and the mapper gives no response, the map may be disqualified for further discussion.
+ **Disqualification posts must contain a short reason for the disqualification, as well as links to any related issues posted in the beatmap discussions.** 
+ **Ensure that you are looking at the most up to date version of the beatmap before disqualifying.** 
+ **Beatmaps qualified in modding v1 that need to be disqualified should be brought to the attention of the NAT.** 
+ **Issues that can be resolved via the map management panel must still be disqualified.** In the case that this is not possible, contact a member of the NAT.
+ **Beatmap Nominators in probation aren’t able to disqualify a map.** They may however participate in such discussions if desired.

_Change date: 7. April 2019, **in effect immediately**_
