# Rules

The rules listed here affect what Beatmap Nominators can and cannot do when nominating beatmaps as well as set the tone for the general conduct expected from them.

These rules are the result of discussion within the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) and have taken into account feedback from the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) upon their proposal.

Beatmap Nominators possess the tools to nominate beatmaps and shape the world of osu! by promoting new content towards being included in the official listings, for this reason they have to abide by the following rules at all times:

## Rules

Rules are exactly that: **rules.** Violating any of these may get the respective Beatmap Nominator removed permanently from the Beatmap Nominators.

Violations of those rules may be reported to a member of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) directly.

### General

+ **__Every__ mapset is approved through two nominations.** Other factors such as the mapset itself being a Marathon, a normal spread or its length do not matter, the amount of nominations required in order to move it to the Qualified section remains at two. More nominations than necessary must not be done.
+ **Do not nominate beatmap sets that you contributed to.** This applies to your own maps, collaboration difficulties you participate in as well as beatmaps that you hitsounded or made a storyboard for.
+ **Do not nominate a map directly without any communication with the mapper.** The mapper might have done self-changes after the last icon, so nominating a mapset without communicating with the mapper can lead to pointless disqualifications.
+ **Do not qualify any beatmap if you are not yet a full member of the Beatmap Nominators, unless it was nominated by someone who is.** This ensures that a full nominator is always part of the process. New nominators become full members after 1-2 months depending on how they did in that period.
+ **Do not nominate beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You must be qualified to nominate at least one of the game modes included in the mapset by being a member of the respective part of the Beatmap Nominators in order to be allowed to nominate it.
+ **Do not veto beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You are not allowed to nominate them so blocking a nomination without the ability to renominate the beatmap makes no sense.
+ **Do not nominate maps with unrankable issues.** The General Ranking Criteria and additionally all mode-specific Ranking Criteria apply to all sets with mode-specific difficulties.
+ **Do not qualify mapsets whose song already has a Qualified mapset, unless no game modes of both sets overlap - this includes remixed versions**. For example an osu!taiko and osu! mapset of the same song can exist in the Qualified section, whilst an osu!taiko and osu!/osu!taiko hybrid set cannot. This ensures variety among Ranked beatmaps within their respective game modes.
+ **If a bubbled map contains unrankable issues, its bubble must be popped.** This applies even if you do not intend to nominate the mapset.
+ **At least 24 hours must pass between a first nomination and a qualification on every beatmap set if...**
  + the beatmap set has received no nominations prior. 
  + a new difficulty/storyboard has been added.
  + a segment of a difficulty, its storyboard, or its hitsounding have been redone.
  + complex timing has been adjusted.
  + the beatmap set has been changed in response to a nominator's veto.

Other situations do not require a 24 hour wait. This gives other Beatmap Nominators and also the wider community the chance to provide additional suggestions before qualification and veto the placed nomination if necessary.
+ **Do not qualify over any manually popped bubble set by another Beatmap Nominator.** Manually popping bubble resets the bubble counter to zero, so doing this is equivalent to directly qualifying a beatmap without any prior icons.
+ **Make sure no mod posts in the map thread have been ignored before qualifying or bubbling a map.** Posts without a sufficient reply may count as ignored. When in doubt, double check if the Code of Conduct for Mapping and Modding has been violated on the mapthread and act accordingly.


### Conduct

+ **Do not follow any unfinalized rules or amendments.**
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you are unsure of something.** In such cases, ask fellow nominators for assistance before making any rushed decisions. This includes unfamiliar game modes, suspiciously gray area/unrankable issues, quality issues or complex timing.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you cannot reasonably judge it.** Being able to reasonably evaluate a beatmap, either through playtesting or modding experience, is a core part of being able to judge a beatmap’s quality. If you are deemed not to have sufficient playing skill or modding experience, we may call your ability to judge the map into question.
+ **Do not qualify a beatmap if any significant changes were made since it was bubbled.** These may include fixing unrankable issues, changes in object snapping, major changes in flow or object placement, alterations to a song’s timing, etc. When in doubt, such beatmaps must be rebubbled first.
+ **Ensure that kudosu is awarded to all posts that deserve it.** Additionally consult the mapper before giving out kudosu to make sure there are not any reasons why the post does not need kudosu (e.g. the modder has received one already for a different post which you overlooked). If the modpost is too old to receive kudosu, consult the modder to make an additional post linking the original he receives kudosu for.
+ **You must not place any icons besides the star, bubble, bubble pop and heart.** Whilst you are able to set other icons, they are either deprecated and discouraged from use (flame, circle, drum, apple, piano) or reserved for use by the Quality Assurance Team (nuke). If you accidentally set an unwanted icon, contact a QAT immediately or overwrite the icon in case you wanted to post a bubble or heart.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap without properly checking all difficulties of the beatmap all by yourself.** If you are unfamiliar with the game mode some of the difficulties are mapped in, ask fellow Nominators for help. Improper checking includes just running a modding tool before nominating or not even downloading the beatmap.
+ **You can veto a beatmap set by placing a bubble pop icon or a problem stamp on the set that you disagree with being fit for being Ranked.** Placing a beatmap veto over any kind of quality issues that you think need to be addressed before the map can move anywhere is one of your main responsibilities. A proper discussion with attempting to reach a mutual agreement by both sides of the argument has to follow. 
+ **You must not renominate a map in which your nomination was vetoed, unless the respective vetoing nominator agrees to that action or the veto was dismissed through QAT mediation.** Beatmap Nominators may no longer overrule a beatmap veto, and must instead re-initiate mediation with the beatmap veto passing a dismissal before both they and the initial Beatmap Nominator can nominate (should they wish to do so).
+ **You are free to pop a rebubble of another nominator if you are not the original bubble popper and disagree with the reasoning for disregarding the bubble pop.** Thus the original popper is unable to overvote two other nominators.
+ **If the community member(s) requesting disqualification cannot reach an agreement with the mapper and you placed the last bubble or heart on a map, you cannot rebubble or requalify it.** For osu!taiko, osu!catch, osu!mania, and hybrid sets, you may break these conditions once per map due to the low number of nominators.
+ **Abide by the [osu! Community Rules](/wiki/Rules) and the [Code of Conduct for Modding and Mapping](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct) at all times.** As a Beatmap Nominator, your behaviour should serve as a positive example to other members of the community. Infringing upon the Code of Conduct may result in you being placed on a temporary probation, or in extreme cases, removal from the Beatmap Nominators.
