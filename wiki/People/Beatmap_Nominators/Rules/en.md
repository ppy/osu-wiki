# Rules

The rules listed here affect what Beatmap Nominators can and cannot do when nominating beatmaps as well as set the tone for the general conduct expected from them.

These rules are the result of discussion within the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) and have taken into account feedback from the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) upon their proposal.

Beatmap Nominators possess the tools to nominate beatmaps and shape the world of osu! by promoting new content towards being included in the official listings, for this reason they have to abide by the following rules at all times:

## Rules

Rules are exactly that: **rules.** Violating any of these may get the respective Beatmap Nominator removed permanently from the Beatmap Nominators.

Violations of those rules may be reported to a member of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) directly.

### General

+ **__Every__ mapset is approved through two nominations.** Other factors such as the mapset itself being a Marathon, a normal spread or its length do not matter, the amount of nominations required in order to move it to the Qualified section remains at two. More nominations than necessary must not be done.
+ **Do not nominate beatmapsets that you contributed to.** This applies to your own maps, collaboration difficulties you participate in as well as beatmaps that you hitsounded or made a storyboard for.
+ **Do not nominate a map directly without any communication with the mapper.** The mapper might have done self-changes after the last icon, so nominating a mapset without communicating with the mapper can lead to pointless disqualifications.
+ **Do not qualify beatmaps of modes which you are not a full member of, unless they were nominated by someone who is.** This ensures that a full nominator is always part of the process for each mode.
+ **Hybrid beatmapsets must be nominated by full nominators from two of its modes in order to be qualified**, as well as gain clear approval from any remaining modes' nominators in the modding discussion. This means only full members may nominate hybrid sets, and ensures that a full nominator takes responsibility for each mode (regardless of nominating or just giving approval in the discussion). In this scenario, nominators proficient in multiple modes can approve more than one mode.
+ **Do not nominate beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You must be qualified to nominate at least one of the game modes included in the mapset by being a member of the respective part of the Beatmap Nominators in order to be allowed to nominate it.
+ **Do not veto beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You are not allowed to nominate them so blocking a nomination without the ability to renominate the beatmap makes no sense.
+ **Do not nominate maps with unrankable issues.** The General Ranking Criteria and additionally all mode-specific Ranking Criteria apply to all sets with mode-specific difficulties.
+ **Do not qualify mapsets whose song already has a Qualified mapset, unless no game modes of both sets overlap - this includes remixed versions**. For example an osu!taiko and osu! mapset of the same song can exist in the Qualified section, whilst an osu!taiko and osu!/osu!taiko hybrid set cannot. This ensures variety among Ranked beatmaps within their respective game modes.
+ **If a bubbled map contains unrankable issues, its bubble must be popped.** This applies even if you do not intend to nominate the mapset.
+ **Do not qualify over any manually popped bubble set by another Beatmap Nominator.** Manually popping bubble resets the bubble counter to zero, so doing this is equivalent to directly qualifying a beatmap without any prior icons.
+ **Make sure no mod posts in the map thread have been ignored before qualifying or bubbling a map.** Posts without a sufficient reply may count as ignored. When in doubt, double check if the Code of Conduct for Mapping and Modding has been violated on the mapthread and act accordingly.
+ **Do not partake or participate in paid modding, ranking OR beatmapping commissions.** There should never be any question as to the legitimacy or motives of members of any "official" osu! team (BN, NAT or otherwise) involved in the ranking process.
+ **Disqualifications should primarily be done for beatmaps with unrankable issues, or if the mapset owner requests it.**
+ **Qualified beatmaps found with unrankable issues must first be posted to the [Report a Beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/447428) thread.** If the issue has already been reported by someone else, then you are free to disqualify the beatmap. If there is less than 48 hours until rank, it may be disqualified immediately. Getting a second person to confirm greatly reduces the chance that disqualifications are mistakes and is often quick to do.
+ **Disqualification requests by the mapset owner can be applied immediately.** This includes yourself, in case you want to self-dq.
+ **For non-unrankable issues or concerns, the mapper should be given time until 24 hours before estimated rank time to respond.** If the mapper fails to respond, the beatmap may be disqualified for further discussion. This does not apply to posts made less than 48 hours before the estimated rank date of the beatmapset, to give mappers ample time to reply and decide whether to make changes.
+ **When resetting a nomination, the first line of the post must contain a short reason for the reset.** Simply linking to posts is not enough, you should try to summarise the relevant posts. In the case of disqualifications, simply writing that it was requested is also not enough. You must link any related issues posted in the beatmap discussions unless there are too many to post. 
+ **Ensure that you are looking at the most up to date version of the beatmap before disqualifying.** 
+ **Beatmaps qualified in modding v1 that need to be disqualified should be brought to the attention of the NAT.** 
+ **Issues that can be mitigated through online offsets, tags or similar must still be disqualified.** In the case that this is not possible, contact a member of the NAT. Online offsets and tags only apply for the website, so players will still have the issues in the client unless fixed before ranked.
+ **Only full members may disqualify beatmaps, regardless of reason.** Probation members may however still participate in such discussions and report beatmaps like everyone else.


### Conduct

+ **Do not follow any unfinalized rules or amendments.**
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you are unsure of something.** In such cases, ask fellow nominators for assistance before making any rushed decisions. This includes unfamiliar game modes, suspiciously gray area/unrankable issues, quality issues or complex timing.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you cannot reasonably judge it.** Being able to reasonably evaluate a beatmap, either through playtesting or modding experience, is a core part of being able to judge a beatmap’s quality. If you are deemed not to have sufficient playing skill or modding experience, we may call your ability to judge the map into question.
+ **Do not qualify a beatmap if any significant changes were made since it was bubbled.** These may include fixing unrankable issues, changes in object snapping, major changes in flow or object placement, alterations to a song’s timing, etc. When in doubt, such beatmaps must be rebubbled first.
+ **Ensure that kudosu is awarded to all posts that deserve it.** Additionally consult the mapper before giving out kudosu to make sure there are not any reasons why the post does not need kudosu (e.g. the modder has received one already for a different post which you overlooked). If the modpost is too old to receive kudosu, consult the modder to make an additional post linking the original he receives kudosu for.
+ **You must not place any icons besides the star, bubble, bubble pop and heart.** Whilst you are able to set other icons, they are either deprecated and discouraged from use (flame, circle, drum, apple, piano) or reserved for use by the Nomination Assessment Team (nuke). If you accidentally set an unwanted icon, contact a NAT immediately or overwrite the icon in case you wanted to post a bubble or heart.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap without properly checking all difficulties of the beatmap all by yourself.** If you are unfamiliar with the game mode some of the difficulties are mapped in, ask fellow Beatmap Nominators for help. Improper checking includes just running a modding tool before nominating or not even downloading the beatmap.
+ **You can veto a nominated/qualified beatmapset by posting the issues you think need to be addressed before reaching Ranked status in the form of problems in the respective modding discussion.** This will reset all nominations the beatmapset has received and thereby stop it from proceeding to Ranked. Other nominators will be unable to nominate it again until the veto is lifted. The veto post must clearly state that it is a veto and include a clear problem and reasoning for stopping the ranking process of the beatmapset. You must participate in the resulting discussion and attempt to reach a mutual agreement.
+ **Do not veto for unrankables.** Unrankables imply that no other nominator should nominate and that the mapper has no other choice but to fix it, in the same way an upheld veto works. Because of this, disqualifying for unrankables often requires a second person to confirm the issue.
+ **Do not nominate vetoed beatmapsets.** The only exception is if the respective vetoing nominator agrees to that action. A beatmapset can have its veto dismissed if the mapper or vetoing nominator requests a mediation and the jury decides that the veto is unnecessary or detrimental.
+ **Abide by the [osu! Community Rules](/wiki/Rules) and the [Code of Conduct for Modding and Mapping](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct) at all times.** As a Beatmap Nominator, your behaviour should serve as a positive example to other members of the community. Infringing upon the Code of Conduct may result in you being placed on a temporary probation, or in extreme cases, removal from the Beatmap Nominators.
