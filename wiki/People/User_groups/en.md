# User groups

![User group badge example](img/user-group-badge.png "User group badge on a user's profile page")

Listed below are **user groups**, most of which are made up of osu! community members that help maintain osu!. Most of these user groups can be recognised by their [forum](/wiki/Community/Forum) colours, [in-game chat](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console) colours, [user titles](/wiki/Community/User_title), and/or user group badges.

Clicking the badges will lead to the respective group listings, while the names link to the wiki articles.
