# Becoming a Beatmap Nominator

Users interested in joining the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) need to go through an application process overseen by the [NAT](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team). Applications are conducted via the [NAT website](http://bn.mappersguild.com/).

Applicants are required to meet a modding activity requirement, submit at least two maps they have recently modded, and complete a test on the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) in order to submit their application. There is a 90-day cooldown for submitting new applications once an application has been submitted. A message from the NAT will be sent once a verdict has been decided. More information on applying can be found on the website.

### Basic criteria

Modders aiming to apply to the Beatmap Nominators must fulfill the following criteria:
- They have been modding beatmaps actively for at least 3 months prior to the announcement.
- They have accumulated at least 150 or 200 [kudosu](/wiki/Glossary#kudosu!) in total, depending on the mode they will apply to.
- They provide 2 to 4 of their mods which they think qualify them to be a part of the Beatmap Nominators.

### What qualifies as a mod post

- Upon signing up, the website will automatically calculate your kudosu score from the last 3 months.
- A qualified mod post is a user's posts on a beatmap discussion, in which at least one suggestion/problem got awarded with an upvote, and has been created within the 3 months.
- The game mode that you modded beatmaps in does not matter as your activity in the modding community as a whole is being measured and not the activity in a certain game mode.
- The point in time at which the kudosu has been awarded to your mod post **does** matter, as the calculator embed in the website will fetch the data from your own Modding History events.

### Modding expectations

Submitted mods should show that a user is capable of analyzing and improving maps to a standard fit for the Beatmap Nominators.

The following are modding traits expected of Beatmap Nominators. Failure to display any of these traits may result in a rejected application.

- Coverage of all difficulty levels
- Identification of unrankable issues, including ones tools can't detect, such as incorrect timing or metadata
- Comparison between parts of a map to support issues or suggestions
- Commentary about a wide variety of map elements, such as rhythm, spacing, movement, intensity, contrast, and consistency
- Identification of both isolated issues and general map-wide issues

### How the required minimum score is calculated

- This depends on the total `Mod Score` an applicant achieved over the last months. This value is determined according to the following formula:

![Mod Score Formula](/wiki/shared/Modscore_new_wiki.png "Mod Score Formula")

`m` = Minimum expected number of individual beatmaps modded in a month  
`M` = Total achieved number of individual beatmaps modded in a month

- [The website](http://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps) has a tool for calculating mod score on its main page.
- In order to determine their `Required Minimum Score`, the sum of the total Mod Score within the last three months must be greater or equal to zero,
- The overall minimum threshold is set to the following values:
  - osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania: m = 3 and a total of 150 kudosu or more
  - osu!: m = 4 and a total of 200 kudosu or more
- It is usually a good idea to keep your score above these numbers, as they can vary slightly depending on the number of applicants.

### How new potential Beatmap Nominators are chosen

- The `Mod Score` of all applications will be doublechecked to confirm if they reached the `Required Minimum Score`.
- Modders that acquired enough score will be evaluated by the corresponding NAT members of the game mode they applied for, taking into account the following criteria:
  - General attitude: Tone of delivery of the mods and other behavioural expectations from the [Code of Conduct](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct), as well as general behaviour in chat/forums.
  - Modding abilities: Knowledge of the general [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and specific criteria of each game mode. Additional abilities like Metadata, Timing, and some others will also be taken into consideration.
- After evaluating each modder, a discussion will be made on whether the modder will join the Beatmap Nominators.
