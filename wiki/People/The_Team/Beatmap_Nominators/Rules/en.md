# Rules for Beatmap Nominators

The rules listed here affect what [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) can and cannot do when nominating beatmaps as well as set the tone for the general conduct expected from them. These rules are the result of discussion within the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) and have taken into account feedback from the Beatmap Nominators upon their proposal.

Beatmap Nominators possess the tools to nominate beatmaps and shape the world of osu! by promoting new content towards being included in the official listings, for this reason they have to abide by the rules at all times. Violating any of these may get the respective Beatmap Nominator removed from the Beatmap Nominators. Violations of those rules may be reported to a member of the Nomination Assessment Team directly.

## Conduct

- **Do not follow any unfinalized rules or amendments.**
- **Abide by the [osu! Community Rules](/wiki/Rules) and the [Code of Conduct for Modding and Mapping](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct) at all times.** As a Beatmap Nominator, your behaviour should serve as a positive example to other members of the community. Infringing upon the Code of Conduct may result in you being placed on a temporary probation, or in extreme cases, removal from the Beatmap Nominators.
- **Do not partake or participate in paid modding, ranking OR beatmapping commissions.** There should never be any question as to the legitimacy or motives of members of any "official" osu! team (BN, NAT or otherwise) involved in the ranking process.

## Activity

- **Activity requirements for your respective gamemode(s) must be met.** Average activity over the last 3 months will be checked monthly, taking into account any leave of absence communicated. Any BN who falls below their mode's required average will get an activity warning.
- **When warned for activity, minimum activity requirements for your respective gamemode(s) must be met over the course of one month.** Failing to meet the required minimum when being warned for it prior may result in removal from the Beatmap Nominators.

### Requirements

Multiple activities available to Beatmap Nominators can be peformed to gain activity: nominating, quality assurance (QA) checking, and nomination resetting. These can be mixed and matched to meet the equivalent of your gamemode's minimum requirement.

Activity is measured in nominations, meaning that each nomination is worth one point of activity. Each QA check is equal to 1/4 the activity of a nomination. Resetting beatmaps is taken into account but to a lesser extent, and it has no set ratio compared to nominations.

Each mode has its own required minimum for monthly activity.

- osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch: equivalent of 3 nominations.
- osu!mania: equivalent of 2 nominations.
- Hybrid: equivalent of 3 nominations, with at least 1 per proficient gamemode.

## Nomination

- **Do not nominate beatmaps with unrankable issues.** The General Ranking Criteria and additionally all mode-specific Ranking Criteria apply to all sets with mode-specific difficulties.
- **Do not nominate beatmapsets that you contributed to.** This applies to your own beatmaps, collaboration difficulties you participate in as well as beatmaps that you hitsounded or made a storyboard for.
- **Do not nominate a beatmap without properly checking all difficulties of the beatmapset all by yourself.** If you are unfamiliar with the game mode some of the difficulties are mapped in, ask fellow Beatmap Nominators for help. Improper checking includes just running a modding tool before nominating or not even downloading the beatmap.
- **Do not nominate a beatmap if you are unsure of something.** In such cases, ask fellow nominators for assistance before making any rushed decisions. This includes unfamiliar game modes, suspiciously gray area/unrankable issues, quality issues or complex timing.
- **Do not nominate a beatmap if you cannot reasonably judge it.** Being able to reasonably evaluate a beatmap, either through playtesting or modding experience, is a core part of being able to judge a beatmap’s quality. If you are deemed not to have sufficient playing skill or modding experience, we may call your ability to judge the beatmap into question.
- **Do not nominate beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You must be qualified to nominate at least one of the game modes included in the beatmapset by being a member of the respective part of the Beatmap Nominators in order to be allowed to nominate it.
- **Make sure no mod posts in the beatmap discussion have been ignored before nominating a beatmap.** Posts without a sufficient reply may count as ignored. When in doubt, double check if the Code of Conduct for Mapping and Modding has been violated on the beatmap discussion and act accordingly.

### Qualification

- **Different beatmaps of similar versions of a song cannot be qualified in the same mode at the same time.** Similar versions of a song include cuts, extensions, and simple covers.
- **Only 3 significantly different versions of a song may be qualified in the same mode at the same time.** Significantly different versions include remixes, compilations, and mashups.
- **Do not qualify beatmaps of modes which you are not a full member of, unless they were nominated by someone who is.** This ensures that a full nominator is always part of the process for each mode.
- **Do not qualify a beatmap directly without any communication with the mapper.** The mapper might have done self-changes after the last nomination, so nominating a beatmapset without communicating with the mapper can lead to pointless disqualifications.
- **Hybrid beatmapsets must be nominated by full nominators from two of its modes in order to be qualified**, as well as gain clear approval from any remaining modes' nominators in the modding discussion. This means only full members may nominate hybrid sets, and ensures that a full nominator takes responsibility for each mode (regardless of nominating or just giving approval in the discussion). In this scenario, nominators proficient in multiple modes can approve more than one mode.

## Nomination reset

- **When resetting a beatmap's nomination(s), the first line of the post must contain a short reason for the reset.** Simply linking to posts is not enough, you should try to summarise the relevant posts. In the case of disqualifications, simply writing that it was requested is also not enough. You must link any related issues posted in the beatmap discussions unless there are too many to post.
- **If a nominated beatmap contains unrankable issues, its nomination(s) must be reset.** This applies even if you do not intend to nominate the beatmapset.
- **Ensure that you are looking at the most up to date version of the beatmap before resetting the beatmap's nomination(s).**

### Disqualification

- **Only full members may disqualify beatmaps, regardless of reason.** Probation members may however still participate in such discussions and report beatmaps like everyone else.
- **Disqualifications should primarily be done for beatmaps with unrankable issues, or if the beatmapset owner requests it.**
- **Disqualification requests by the beatmapset owner can be applied immediately.** This includes yourself, in case you want to self-dq.
- **Issues that can be mitigated through online offsets, tags or similar must still be disqualified.** In the case that this is not possible, contact a member of the NAT. Online offsets and tags only apply for the website, so players will still have the issues in the client unless fixed before Ranked.
- **Qualified beatmaps found with unrankable or significant issues must be disqualified immediately.**
- **Do not disqualify beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** This does not apply to disqualifications regarding audio, backgrounds, or other content that does not directly pertain to the beatmap's game mode.

### Veto

Please see the [beatmap veto](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Veto) page for full information on the veto process.

- **Do not veto beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You are not allowed to nominate them so blocking a nomination without the ability to renominate the beatmap makes no sense. This does not apply to vetoes regarding audio, backgrounds, or other content that does not directly pertain to the beatmap's game mode.
- **You can veto a nominated/qualified beatmapset by posting the issues you think need to be addressed before reaching Ranked status in the form of problems in the respective modding discussion.** This will reset all nominations the beatmapset has received and thereby stop it from proceeding to Ranked. Other nominators will be unable to nominate it again until the veto is lifted. The veto post must include a clear problem and reasoning for stopping the ranking process of the beatmapset. You must participate in the resulting discussion and attempt to reach a mutual agreement.
- **Do not veto for unrankables.** Unrankables imply that no other nominator should nominate and that the mapper has no other choice but to fix it, in the same way an upheld veto works.
- **Do not nominate vetoed beatmapsets.** The only exception is if the respective vetoing nominator agrees to that action. A beatmapset can have its veto dismissed if the mapper or vetoing nominator requests a mediation and the jury decides that the veto is unnecessary or detrimental.
