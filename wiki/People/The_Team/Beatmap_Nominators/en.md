# Beatmap Nominators

*See also: [Beatmap Nominator Rules](Rules), [Expectations for Beatmap Nominators](Expectations), [General Information for Beatmap Nominators](General_Information), and [Becoming a Beatmap Nominator](Becoming_a_Beatmap_Nominator)*

The **Beatmap Nominators** (***BN***) is a group in charge of [beatmap nomination](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). They have a purple name on the forums and in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion).

## Roles and responsibilities

Members of the Beatmap Nominators are responsible primarily for [modding](/wiki/Modding) [pending beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#work-in-progress-and-pending) and approving them into the ranking cycle. Beatmap Nominators are the people to go to for advice or requests about anything mapping or modding related. Any beatmap nominator can place a [beatmap veto](Beatmap_Veto) if they feel a nominated map has issues that must be fixed which are not direct violations of the Ranking Criteria.

In addition, all Beatmap Nominators are expected to adhere to a loose set of ideals focused around service to the greater community by directing their attention to a wide variety of maps and mappers, and striving to constantly improve their craft, as outlined in [the Expectations for Beatmap Nominators article](Expectations).

Members of the Beatmap Nominators are divided into two groups: full members and probationary members.

### Full Beatmap Nominators

In addition to regular beatmap modding and ranking, full members of the Beatmap Nominators are responsible for disqualifying beatmaps in the qualified section that are found to have issues. Full Beatmap Nominators may also participate in occasional Beatmap Nominator application assessment if they are interested in joining the Nomination Assessment Team in the future.

Approximately each three months, full Beatmap Nominators have their behaviour and nomination activity/quality [evaluated](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team/Evaluations) by the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team). If their nominations are frequently reset for notable reasons or their behaviour is unacceptable, they may be moved to the probationary Beatmap Nominators.

Full Beatmap Nominators with below minimum nomination activity will not be placed on probation, however they will be removed from the group if their activity does not improve.

### Probationary Beatmap Nominators

Probation is used to monitor new or concerning Beatmap Nominators more closely. The main role for probationary Beatmap Nominators is to establish a foundation as a Beatmap Nominator through exclusively promoting beatmaps in the ranking process. At least one full nominator must be involved in the ranking process for each game mode of a beatmap, so probationary members cannot give the final nomination to a beatmap which has only received nominations from other probationary members for their game mode.

New members of the Beatmap Nominators begin with a one month long probation period. If their nominations and behaviour are satisfactory, they will be promoted to the full Beatmap Nominators following a positive [evaluation](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team/Evaluations). Otherwise, they will remain on probation for another month or be removed from the Beatmap Nominators.

When a Beatmap Nominator is placed on probation, they cannot be placed on probation again for the same reason. For example, if a Beatmap Nominator is placed on probation for poor behaviour, they will be removed from the Beatmap Nominators if they exhibit the same poor behaviour again, even if they are a full Beatmap Nominator during the second infringement.

## Team members

The [Beatmap Nominators](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/28) and [Beatmap Nominators (Probationary)](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/32) group pages list all of the team members.

The tables listed below indicate the game mode(s) in which each Beatmap Nominator is formally qualified to nominate. *Note: All Beatmap Nominators speak English in addition to the language(s) listed below unless noted otherwise.*

## History

- The Beatmap Nominators were previously called the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (BAT).
- On the 22nd of August, 2014, the BAT were no longer considered a part of the staff team. This revoked their chat moderation ability in-game and their red name in-game and on the forums.
- On the 1st of February, 2015, the team was changed from the *Beatmap Appreciation Team* to the *Beatmap Nomination Group*, later adjusted to the Beatmap Nominators that we know today.

<!--- updated to April 15, 2022 with the addition of Kim_GodSSI to the Probationary BN --->
