# Global Moderation Team

*See also: [Mod (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Mod).*

The **Global Moderation Team** (formerly known as the Global Mod Team, Administrators, or GreenBAT), commonly referred to as **GMT**, are members of the community who are focused primarily on player moderation and issues pertinent to the team and the community at large. They are distinguished by their user title and the username colour, which is red in-game and citrus green on the forums.

**All Global Moderators are sworn to uphold [the Contributor Code of Conduct](/wiki/Contributor_Code_of_Conduct) in addition to the normal [Community Rules](/wiki/Rules).**

## Roles and responsibilities

***Note: To report a moderator misbehaving or breaking the Contributor Code of Conduct, contact the [account support team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Account_support_team#support@ppy.sh).***\
*See also: [Reporting Bad Behaviour](/wiki/Reporting_Bad_Behaviour)*

The Global Moderation Team is responsible for the welfare of the chat and forum, and takes care of interactions within the community. They should be approached with any questions pertaining the moderation aspect of the game, which would include (but is not limited to):

- issues with chat (e.g. spam or harassment)
- misbehaviour on forum (e.g. inappropriate posts)
- the beatmap discussions and comment section
- user profile moderation (NSFW or otherwise offensive content in avatars, profile covers or details, ...)

## Becoming a moderator

Becoming a member of the Global Moderation Team requires a notable amount of contribution. Potential members are often noticed for their willingness to help other users, activity within the community, and good behaviour. The ability to speak languages other than English is strongly preferred. Candidates are discussed within the team to determine their potential addition as a team member.

### How to be considered

The most important factors for consideration are behaviour, activity, understanding of [the rules](/wiki/Rules), and patience:

1. Demonstrate good behaviour by being polite and treating other users with respect. Keeping your account free of any serious silences or issues is essential.
2. Demonstrate in-game activity by participating in the chat and/or the forums. [Report any misbehaviour](/wiki/Reporting_Bad_Behaviour) and problems via the report system. Answer questions and assist others with issues.
3. Have a proper understanding of [the rules](/wiki/Rules) and how they are applied. It is important to know what is acceptable within osu! and what is not.
4. Be patient. The GMT does not spontaneously add members who have been helping for just a few days. It takes time for the GMT to evaluate someone⁠—their personality, what they can help with, their activity, etc.

Generally, the team will observe people for several weeks or months to make sure they are a worthy addition to the team. Please be patient and do not go overboard. Feel free to ask anyone from the GMT about any questions regarding rules, reporting users, and any other issues.

### Some things not to do

1. Do not continually ask the GMT about your standing as a potential candidate. The GMT does not look to add anyone who is contributing as a means to an end. An altruistic mindset is key.
2. Do not report every little thing in chat. It is an important skill to know what is worth reporting and what is not.
3. Do not answer other people's questions without knowing whether said answer is correct or not, particularly on the forums. Suggestions are welcome, but misinforming people is not helpful to anyone. If you do not know the solution to a problem, let someone else answer and learn from them.
4. Do not overdo things. The team looks for consistent contribution, not an overloaded amount. This is known to burn people out and make them lose patience and commitment. Take it easy!
