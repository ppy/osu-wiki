# Completionists

**Completionists** are players who have completed every [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) of a given [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode). Because the amount of Ranked beatmaps increases every day, this feat becomes progressively more difficult to achieve.

As of September 2023, this achievement is recognised through a [profile badge](/wiki/Community/Profile_badge) handed out at the discretion of the [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team):
