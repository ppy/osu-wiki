# Completionists

**Completionists** are players who have completed every [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) of a given [ruleset](/wiki/Game_mode). Because the amount of Ranked beatmaps increases every day, this feat becomes progressively more difficult to achieve.

As of September 2023, this achievement is recognised through a [profile badge](/wiki/Community/Profile_badge).

# Completionist badge

The **completionist** badge was an official award granted to users for setting a score on every ranked beatmap. The badge was discontinued by the osu! team for unknown reasons.

**Used badges:**

**Unused badges**: The following rulesets have never had a single badge awarded despite multiple users meeting the criteria, and will likely never be granted.
