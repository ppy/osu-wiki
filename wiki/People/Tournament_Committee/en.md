# Tournament Committee

The **Tournament Committee** is a panel of skilled and established organisers and helpers in the tournament scene.

Their responsibilities include:

- Managing reports from the [tournament reports form](https://pif.ephemeral.ink/tournament-reports)
- Observing the general tournament scene and advising the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) on a case-by-case basis
- Regularly reviewing the [Official tournament support](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support) page for revisions where necessary

The panel was first announced to the public on July 22, 2021 through the `#tournaments` channel in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ppy) in response to the rapidly growing community tournament scene in osu!.

## How can I help contribute?

You can help the tournament committee by continuing to run excellent tournaments! If you have any issues or concerns regarding any aspect of a community tournament, we encourage you to bring these to our attention via the tournament reports form.

Those who are interested in joining the tournament committee may express their interest by sending an email to the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) via [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh), where requests are forwarded to the committee. Successful candidates are expected to have a significant breadth of experience in the tournament scene, either as a player or staff.
