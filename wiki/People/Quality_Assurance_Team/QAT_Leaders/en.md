# QAT Leaders

Following [Loctav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71366)'s leave from osu! management at the end of 2017, the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) (*QAT*) elected **QAT leaders** to take control of the group. This decision was made because members of the QAT felt that Loctav and [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) had too much control of the group, and that the QAT would be better led by its own members.

The vote for QAT leaders was handled through a vote of all [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) and QAT members. Results of the vote, found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/640679), promoted [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) and [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508) as the first QAT leaders. Their responsibility was to work with the osu! team to maintain the mapping and modding communities.

The QAT leaders were replaced with [-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202163), [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515), and [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) throughout the next two years.

By 2020, there was no need for a formal QAT (eventually [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (*NAT*)) leader position, which lead to it being discountinued.

As of March 2023, the NAT has decided to re-adopt the concept of leadership; for more information, see [Nomination Assessment Team § NAT Leadership](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team#nat-leadership).
