Flow of beatmap design
----------------------

When creating a beatmap, it is a good practice to follow the music's *beat*. As this will help (or harm) players get the idea of what your original intentions were.

Basic knowledge of mapping

Here are the **Basic knowledge of mapping**

### Symmetry

Symmetry is when the beatmap is symmetrical in respect to an axis. The most common type of symmetry is horizontal symmetry. There are other types of symmetry too, however, like vertical symmetry, diagonal symmetry, and symmetry with respect to the origin (Normally we would say, "Think of an odd function", but that would probably alienate a large portion of the playerbase).

### Jumps

A jump is an advanced mapping technique where the mapper places two hit objects farther apart than the standard distance snap multiplier would allow. This is usually done by either temporarily changing the distance snap multiplier or temporarily turning off distance snap.

### Streams

A stream is a succession of hit circles at a quick, consistent pace from each other. When somebody refers to a "stream", they are usually referring to a stream of hit circles a fourth of a beat from each other. If a player wants to refer to a stream of hit objects half a beat apart from each other, they typically call it a "1/2 stream".

### Spreads

A spread is an advanced mapping technique where the mapper places two hit objects and irregularly located like jump style but doesn't make sense when they're click . This is usually done by either temporarily changing the distance snap multiplier or temporarily turning off distance snap.
