## Patterns

### Etna Sliders

Nominator(s): [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

Etna sliders is typically comprised of 6 to 8 sliders that are half a beat long and separated by another half a beat.
They can go in any direction and there are usually plenty of them.

The term "Estna sliders" were coined by [awp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2650) and named after a [character from Disgaea](http://disgaea.wikia.com/wiki/Etna) who appeared in one of his maps.

### Introverted Flow

Nominator(s): [Lizzy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1394757)

Introverted flow is (literally translated from Latin) "pointing towards inside".
This can be seen as:

- a sharp flow dropoff from an arc to another that sometimes [blankets](/wiki/Mapping_Techniques/Formations#blanket-combos) the start of the previous one.
- a not-so sharp dropoff making the first arc [blanket](/wiki/Mapping_Techniques/Formations#blanket-combos) the end of the second one, with or without hit circle between.

### Mirrored Sliders

Nominator(s): [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

Mirrored sliders uses two sliders that are identical.
However, one of these are flipped and reversed.

### Parallel Sliders

Nominator(s): [rust45](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/117369)

Parallel sliders uses a group of sliders that are all parallel to each other, the slider starts may or may not be next to the ends and they may go any direction.

### Segment Sliders

Nominator(s): [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661)

Segment sliders is comprised of a number of sliders that start on the previous slider's end point.
They are usually done with [Etna sliders](#etna-sliders), but can also be used with sliders 3 to 4 or more beats long.

### Short Repeating Sliders

_Also known as: **Kick Slider**_

_Not to be confused with [Hold Sliders](/wiki/Mapping_Techniques/Unrankable#hold-sliders)._

Nominator(s): [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

Short repeating sliders consist of a series of sliders that are both short and having many repeats.
All sliders usually have the same number of repeats and fall on the whole or half beat in order to make it easy to follow.

### Slider Trains

_Also known as: **Slider Fans**_

Nominator(s): [MegaManEXE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/951)

Slider Trains is a series of sliders (of same length) placed in the shape of a fan.
The player must click each slider, as if it is a stream.

For example, if it was a 1/2 slider, the player would click in a 1/1 rhythm.

The sliders can go in, or out (or both).

### Zig-Zagging Sliders

Nominator(s): [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9934)

Zig-Zagging sliders are half-beat sliders arranged in a zig-zag pattern (like a "Z" or an "S").
However, these are positioned so that the each slider moves away from the next slider, creating a quick jump for the player.

### Cutting Sliders

Nominator(s): [Mashley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/41481)

Cutting sliders consists of 2 sliders, usually 1 beat long and 1/2 a beat apart, that overlap each other.
The second slider looks like it is _cutting through_ the other slider, hence the name.

### Crumpled Sliders

Nominator(s): [Lilac](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/58197)

Crumpled sliders uses a slider with many control points to compress the slider in order to create a sort of crumpled or squashed effect.
In essence, this would make a slider seem shorter than it is supposed to be.
These can come in various forms.

### End-Cutter Sliders

Nominator(s): [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661)

End-Cutter sliders uses a slider whose end is stacked on another slider's path.

### Krisom-Krosses

Nominator(s): [Rukario](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/110372)

Krisom-Krosses consists of two [Wave Sliders](#wave-sliders).
These are horizontally or vertically [mirrored sliders](#mirrored-sliders) such that the middle of both sliders overlap.

This technique is named after by [Krisom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/99269).

### Rainbow Sliders

Nominator(s): MetalMario201

Rainbow sliders are large, arc-shaped sliders which generally take up half of the screen.
These are best used in places with long, climactic, hold notes (sort of like spinners).

## Miscellaneous

Nominator(s): [GladiOol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/23326)

Switch-Back sliders consists of a curved half-beat slider.
It is then copy-and-pasted, rotated 180 degrees, and placed so it curves into the previous slider (similar to [Etna sliders](#etna-sliders)).
A hit circle is then placed where the previous slider head was.

### Tick-Hitsounds

Nominator(s): [Rolled](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5243)

Tick-Hitsounds consists of slider ticks that has been replaced with a standard hitsound (clap, whistle, finish - usually overlayed with hit-normal/soft for accurate sound).
