[AiMod](AiMod "wikilink") is a tool built in the osu! Beatmap Editor, you can open it by pressing **\[Control\] + \[Shift\] + \[A\]** or by clicking **File** » **Open AiMod**. <img src="Aimod.png" title="fig:AiMod is usually your first modder" alt="AiMod is usually your first modder" width="300" /> AiMod will help new mappers "mod" their maps. The issues with AiMod is that it was designed to be simple, so AiMod will most likely not detect issues with mapping patterns or bad BPM/timing. So in the end, you will still need a [modder](Modder "wikilink") to mod your beatmap.

After AiMod checks over your beatmap (should take less than a minute), the warnings and errors are displayed. If "No problems were found in this map!"… Then congratulations! Your beatmap passed the AiMod "modding", but you'll still need to find [modder](Modder "wikilink") to mod your beatmap because they will find more issues than what AiMod can detect.

Tabs
----

**All**

-   Gathers the items from the other tabs.

**Compose**

-   These problems are generally the problem of object placement.
    -   You may need to check the "Check distance snap" box for these warnings to appear (as these checks could cause lag, depending on beatmap size/length)

**Design**

-   These problems are generally some of the interface issues, such as the background, storyboards, etc.

**Timing**

-   When these problems appear, check the timeline because something is probably placed incorrectly.

**Meta**

-   When these problems appear, check out the song setup.

**Mapset**

-   These problems affect the mapset as a whole.
