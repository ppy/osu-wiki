# Beatmap search

*See also: [Beatmap ยง Downloading beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap#downloading-beatmaps)*

By default, any text entered at the [song select screen](/wiki/Client/Interface#song-select) or in the website's search field is matched against a beatmap's song artist, title, difficulty creator and name, source, and tags. Entering a single number will search for beatmaps and difficulties with a specific [identifier](/wiki/Beatmap#identification). All queries are case-insensitive.

Beatmap metadata fields can be compared against specific values for more granular filtering, using the following operators:

| Comparison | osu!web | osu!(stable) | osu!(lazer) | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| `=` | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | Equal to |
| `==` | ![No][false] | ![Yes][true] | ![No][false] | Equal to |
| `:` | ![Yes][true] | ![No][false] | ![Yes][true] | Equal to |
| `!=` | ![No][false] | ![Yes][true] | ![No][false] | Not equal to |
| `<` | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | Less than |
| `>` | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | Greater than |
| `<=` | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | Less than or equal to |
| `>=` | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | ![Yes][true] | Greater than or equal to |
