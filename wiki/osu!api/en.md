# osu!api

osu! has a public [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) that third-party services can use to expand and support the osu! platform. It used to be more private, only to be used on a per-request basis, but now anybody can use the API so long as they have an osu! account.

You can find documentation of the API at [osu-api's Wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki). The current version of the API uses private keys to authenticate requests. You can apply for an API key at the [application page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api) on osu!'s website.

Note that the documentation on the osu!api wiki may not be entirely complete or extensive, and the API itself is not under active development. A new, much more robust API is in the works at [osu-web](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web).

Documentation for APIv2 is available at https://docs.ppy.sh.
