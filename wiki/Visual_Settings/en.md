# Visual Settings

![Example of Visual Settings](img/VisualSettings.jpg "Example of Visual Settings")

-   Visual Settings is below the screen, a few seconds before the beatmap starts. Having it open delays the beatmap from starting until your mouse pointer leaves it.
    -   You can pause the game to open Visual Settings (Does not work on [Multi](/wiki/Multi)).
