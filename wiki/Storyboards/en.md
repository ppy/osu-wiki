A **storyboard** (SB) is a custom-made animated background that accompanies a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps), often for decorative and sometimes for gameplay purposes. A storyboard can be comprised of just about anything, but usually they consist of visual effects designed to make a map more aesthetically pleasing and distinctive to users. Storyboards are inspired from the animated backgrounds found in [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan](/wiki/Glossary#ouendan). Like their inspiration, storyboards are able to adjust to the player's performance in the game and display different things depending on how well the player is doing.

Storyboards are stored in beatmap folders as either standalone [`.osb` files](/wiki/osu!_File_Formats/Osb_(file_format)) or extensions to the `[Events]` section of a [`.osu` file](/wiki/osu!_File_Formats/Osu_(file_format)). Because of this, it's possible to create different storyboards for different maps within a [beatmapset](/wiki/Glossary#beatmapset).

Storyboards are often very difficult to make and require considerable time and expertise in standard animation and in the creation of graphics. osu! offers a [design editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Design) inside of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor) to aid the creation of storyboards, but most avid storyboard producers opt to instead program via [storyboard scripting](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) directly. Many creators choose to write programs in full-featured programming languages to generate storyboards scripts, because complex visual effects can require a great amount of storyboard code to produce.
