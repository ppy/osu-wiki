# Official Songs

**Official Songs** are songs officially approved by the artist to be used within osu! Every member of the community is allowed to pick up the songs and create their own beatmaps of them. Most of these songs are created exclusively for osu!, and they have bounties placed to encourage the mapping community to create the beatmaps for these songs.

## Bounties

**Bounties** are being offered to help create more original content for osu! Songs listed with a bounty have been provided by the artists with full permission to be used and distributed, and are now waiting to be mapped by the community. Once a beatmap of one of these songs is ranked, it will be checked by osu!staff, and should the quality be deemed sufficient, the bounty will be awarded to the mapper. Beatmap Bounties are only offered to one mapper per mapset - collaborations do not count. The entire mapset must be mapped by *one mapper* for *one game mode* (either osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch or osu!mania). Only one mapset per mode will receive the bounty per song. The background image of these songs will be chosen by the staff. The winner of each song will be determined by the staff exclusively.
