## osu! Introduction

### I've never played this "Ouendan" thing - what is it?
_[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan][ouendan wikipedia]_ is a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay consists of only three elements: tapping circles on the touchscreen, dragging a ball across a fixed path and rotating a spinner very fast. All these elements are timed to (covers of) popular Japanese songs. It looks like this on the DS:-

![Gameplay footage of Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan in Nintendo DS][ouendan image]

_Gameplay footage of Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan in Nintendo DS_

You can see the circles on the bottom screen, and on the top screen you have the story. Each stage is basically a self-contained story about a person in trouble. That's where the _Ouendan_ (Cheer squad) comes in. Through the magical power of male cheerleading, you have to help the people in trouble.

### How to play?
_Full explanation: [osu!][osu! wikilink]_

While most players may not have a touchscreen at their disposal, this game was made to be playable with a normal mouse in mind, as well as any creative variations of input devices usage. Different play styles can be found in the [Play Styles][Play_Styles wikilink] page. There are some songs which will push the limits of the normal mouse and the player, but all the (ranked and approved) beatmaps have been tested and (most can be) passable using only a mouse.

#### Gameplay Basics
_Tutorial: [(Bundled with PC osu!) Original tutorial][osu!tutorial basic], [Ranked beatmap version][osu!tutorial rank]_

The gameplay puts emphasis on:-

- Adaptability and reaction to stimuli (that is, the hittable objects appearing all over the screen at lightning speed).
- Understanding of the song's beat and design.
- Input device control.
- Timing of hits on the object that appeared on the screen.
- Ability to spin the mouse (or your finger/pen for tablet) on spinners.
- Physical stamina and mental fortitude (especially longer, marathon-type songs).
- Proper positioning and hand-eye coordination.

These are some of the vital skills to become an osu! rhythm master. The first step to begin the journey is to learn the basics (and theories) of the hittable objects (referred as _hitobjects_ from here onwards).

##### Hitcircles
![Hitcircles][osu_hitcircles image]

_Some hitcircles placed in a path to tap to the beat_

A thin, similarly-coloured approach circle on the outside of the hitcircle will shrink over time. Tap on the note at the exact point when it touches the white border of the hitcircle. A score burst will appear after tapping the hitcircle, showing the score and health changes depending on timing of the tap to the beat. The hitcircle will disappear after the score burst.

To understand the hidden charm of hitcircles, do not rely only on perception only; feel the beatmap's beats and rhythm. It will help in juggling some of the visually complex hitcircles patterns found in later difficulties.

##### Sliders
![Sliders][osu_slider image]

_A single-repeat straight slider with active orange followcircle surrounding the sliderball and a slidertick inside the slider (small white circle)_

First, tap on it at the right moment, however, it does not end there. A ball will begin to move across the path. Hold the mouse/keyboard-button (or keep the pen onto the tablet) and follow the ball within the thick orange circle, surrounding the ball, as it moves. The orange outer circle, called the follow circle, will appear if when holding onto the slider's ball, but will disappear when released.

Sometimes, as seen in the screenshot above, the ball may reverse its direction and must follow the ball back to the start of the path or vice versa. The visual cue is a reverse arrow at the ending/starting circle of the path.

##### Spinners
![Spinner][osu_spinner image]

_A cleared spinner with spinner bonus_

Hold on the mouse/keyboard-button (or keep the pen onto the tablet). From there, use the mouse (or pen) and spin the spinner in a circular motion (in either direction) until the spinner circle grows outwards completely. A _Clear_ notice will appear to indicate that the spinner was completed. If the spinner was cleared early, continue spinning to collect score bonus and gain some health back.

The outer white circle shows how much time left to complete the spinner. This circle will turn red to notify that time is almost out. Older beatmaps, using skin version 1.0, will have a meter/gauge to indicate how close to clearing the spinner.

The small box below the spinner shows spins per minute. The number inside that box translates to the number of spins possible, if to continue to spin the spinner at that speed for one minute. If mouse/keyboard-button was released (pen did not touch the tablet) early during the spin, the spinner will stop reading the spin.

On the DS, this is a good way to scratch the touchscreen (or screen protector), especially on the higher difficulties. In osu!, spinners have been toned down as to not be such a nuisance to complete. The maximum number of spins per minute achievable is 477 which is also the rate at which the [Auto][Auto wikilink] game modifier spins while the [Spun Out][Spun Out wikilink] game modifier spins slower at 286 spins per minute.

#### In-Game Interface
![osu! interface][osu! Interface image]

_In-game interface of osu!_

The top-left bar is the healthbar. This will decrease at a steady rate (depending on the beatmap's difficulty settings), but can be replenished by tapping notes at the right time or spinning the spinner. A perfectly timed hit (a 300 or Geki) will increase your health more than a badly timed hit (50). A total miss will take a good chunk of your health out.

On the right of the healthbar is the total score. Below that is the accuracy. The circle beside the accuracy (and below the score) is a timer for the duration of the beatmap. The number on the bottom left is the combo counter/score multiplier.

#### Controls
The default controls for osu! are:-

Mouse | Keyboard | Tablet
---|---|---|---
Left click(M1) / Right click(M2)|`Z`(K1) / `X`(K2)|Touching the screen(M1)

The hitobjects in osu! will accept any input from the mouse/keyboard/tablet/specialised input device, as long as each was bursted in time with the beatmap's design.

## Alternative Game Modes
### Changing the game mode
![Mode change interface][Mode Interface image]

_Image showcasing the Mode toolbox in Song Selection (Solo)_

Click on the _Mode_ button to **open up a list of gameplay modes available on osu!**. Click on the desired gameplay mode, and osu! will switch to that gameplay mode style, along with relevant leaderboard change. Alternatively, press `Ctrl` key and `1` (![osu! icon][osu! icon link] [osu!standard][osu! wikilink]) / `2` ( ![osu!taiko icon][osu!taiko icon link] [osu!taiko][osu!taiko wikilink]) / `3` (![osu!catch icon][osu!catch icon link] [osu!catch][osu!catch wikilink]) / `4` (![osu!mania icon][osu!mania icon link] [osu!mania][osu!mania wikilink]) key on the keyboard to quickly switch to the desired gameplay mode.

### What is osu!taiko?
_Full explanation: [osu!taiko][osu!taiko wikilink]_

![osu!taiko Interface][osu!taiko Interface image]

_In-game interface of osu!taiko_

_[Taiko no Tatsujin][Taiko no Tatsujin wikipedia]_ is a taiko drum rhythm game made by Namco. This game involves the simulation of playing the taiko drum to the beat of the music. In osu!, beatmaps can be played in the styling of Taiko no Tatsujin through the use of osu!taiko game mode.

Just like the osu! game mode shown above, there are three elements of gameplay.

#### Basic explanation
##### Playfield
![Taiko playfield][Taiko playfield image]

_In-game playfield interface of osu!taiko_

For players with prior _Taiko no Tatsujin_ experience, the only difference is that there are no chibi dancers at the bottom (must be storyboarded), the healthbar must be at least 50% full to pass the song (which is not really obvious using the default skin; please look in this [Skin Compendium][Skin Compendium link] to find and get a decent osu!taiko skin), _Kiai Time_ triggers the "Go-Go Time", gameplay gimmicks like the hit balloons or forked paths are not implemented (only the barebone basics), and background display difference (osu!taiko-specific beatmaps usually has its own custom background, leaving upper section empty; a video or static background image-only will take the lower portion only; if there is an element of storyboard, it will take over all the available screen space except the gameplay-important parts).

For newcomers of osu!taiko mode, the screen is split to two different sections; the upper section contains the gameplay elements while the lower section contains an image or video for the beatmap. At the upper section, there is the healthbar, which unlike other gamemodes, starts off empty and must be filled up to at least 50% full or half-full to pass the difficulty. At the top-middle part below the healthbar, a taiko drum is located at the left-side and a moving convenyor belt which carries the hitobjects from right to left passing through a double white circles which serves as judgement circle near the taiko drum. Above the taiko drum is the animated taiko mascot which will react based on judgement received along with upper background colour changes. Lastly, there is the usual score, accuracy, and timer of the beatmap at the upper-right.

Please note that health drain is disabled in osu!taiko, so only the hitobjects will affect the healthbar. Combo will not break when playing on an empty field. Unlike osu!, the combo milestone celebration is every 50 consecutive hits. The base score will be boosted after obtaining a combo that is a multiple of 10, but stops at 100 (max combo limit for the boost). If the combo is broken, the boost resets back to the base score. During Kiai Time, every successful hit will give the player 20% more points over the current score amount. Score gained from a hit can be checked below the accuracy at the upper-right corner in red.

##### Taiko notes
![Taiko hitcircles][Taiko hitcircles image]

_osu!taiko notes of various colour and size_

Each taiko notes (or notes, for brevity) will appear as either a red or a pale-blue circle. Those coloured circles were named Don (red notes) and Katu (blue notes) respectively.

If it is a small red note, press the button bound to the inner portion of the taiko drum or hit the large flat area (center) of the TaTaCon. If it is a small blue note, press the button bound to the outer ring of the taiko drum or hit the sides of the TaTaCon. If the note is a **LARGE** circle, press or hit both of either inner or outer drum depending on the colour of the note for double point (a single correct hit will give single point instead).

The notes must be pressed or hit in the small white judgement circle next to the drum. Hitting the wrong colour, or both red and blue colours at the same time, will be considered a miss.

##### Drumrolls
![Taiko drumroll][Taiko drumroll image]

_Drumrolls appears as yellow bar with a starting yellow circle in the playfield with tiny white/yellow hitcircles evenly-spaced inside_

Hit the inner (or outer) drum continuously for points until the end of the drumroll. For **LARGE** note, hit both buttons on the inner (or outer) drum simultaneously and continuously until it is done. Do note that drumrolls hits were hardcapped and only counted when hitting on the tiny hitcircles, rather than drumrolling as fast as possible as in _Taiko no Tatsujin_.

Drumrolls can be ignored with no health penalty, as it does not recover the healthbar at all. However, it will cost possible points gained from the drumroll. Each successful hit on the tiny hitcircle gives a static 300 score.

##### Dendens
![Taiko spinner][Taiko spinner image]

_These appear as spinners, with a countdown displaying the number of hits remaining (denden counter) to clear it, and a shirking blue circle showing the time left to clear it_

Hit the inner and outer drum **in order** (like red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, ...) until the denden counter reached 0. Starting colour does not matter (allowed to start with blue if desired), and failing to complete it will incur miss health penalty but no combo break. Hitting the same colour will not decrement the denden counter, until a different colour is hit instead.

It does not increment the combo counter, and does not recover the healthbar in any way. Each successful denden hit only gives a static 300 score, and denden completion will give a perfect(GREAT) large note score.

#### Controls
The default controls for osu!taiko are:-

Type | Mouse | Keyboard | TaTaCon
---|---|---|---
Red |Left click|`X` / `C`|Flat surface of the drum
Blue|Right click|`Z` / `V`|Outer surface of the drum

The placement of in-game cursor does not matter when playing.

### What is osu!catch?
_Full explanation: [osu!catch][osu!catch wikilink]_

![osu!catch Interface][osu!catch Interface image]

_In-game interface of osu!catch_

_osu!catch_ (formerly known as _Catch the Beat_) is the second game mode added to osu!, after the osu!taiko game mode.

Instead of tapping circles to the beat, move the catcher at the bottom of the screen while the fruits fall from above.

#### Basic explanation
All fruits will stay at the plate until its combo ends, which the fruits will bounce out of the plate. Timing and where it falls on the plate does not matter; either a full score for successful catch or miss.

##### Fruits
![Fruits][Fruits image]

_Fruits are the hitcircles of osu!catch, and it rains down from top of the screen_

To catch these fruits, make sure it falls to the plate, and not over the plate. Collected fruits will always give 300 points each, increment combo by 1, and treated as 300 in result screen.

##### Fruit trails
![Fruit trails][Fruit trails image]

_Fruit trails are the sliders of osu!catch_

A typical fruit trail will contains two fruits (start and end), droplets (sliderpath), juice drop (sliderticks), and more fruits for each reverse arrow points along with a reversed sliderpath. Droplet gives 10 points each and treated as 50 in result screen. Juice drop gives 30 points each, increment combo by 1, and treated as 100 in result screen.

Missing the juice drop will break the combo (as it is a slidertick), but missing the droplet will not break the combo. However, missed droplets will not be shown in the local result screen, but will be shown in the website's leaderboard as _Miss Droplet_, which notably affects accuracy (missed out the droplet, which is a 50) and score (10 points for each droplet missed).

##### Bananas
![Bananas][Bananas image]

_Bananas serves as spinners in osu!catch._

Here, large bananas will rain down and shrink down to catch size as it falls down to the plate (or not). Each collected bananas will give a static score of 1,100 regardless of mod and combo multiplier.

The bananas can be ignored with no health penalty. However, it can cost the extra points and health recovery from collecting the bananas.

Notably, [Auto][Auto wikilink] mod will go above and beyond to catch _all_ of the bananas without fail.

##### Hyperfruits
![Hyperfruits, and catcher hyperdashing from collecting previous hyperfruit][Hyperfruit image]

_Left: Before collecting the hyperfruit. Right: Catcher hyperdash to the next fruit and leaving an afterimage._

Hyperfruits are special fruits that will appear to help the catcher to catch the next fruit when normal dash is considered impossible to catch it in a strict timespan allocated. All hyperfruits have a signature red colour surrounding the hyperfruit itself by default; collecting the hyperfruit will make the catcher's dash upgraded to _hyperdash_ (just fast enough to catch the next fruit), glows red, and leaves a temporary red _afterimage_ at the collection point, until the next one fruit was caught or dropped, which the catcher will then be back to normal.

#### Controlling the catcher
- By default, the left `<-` and right `->` arrow keys to move the catcher.
- Pressing the `leftShift` key with one of the arrow keys will make the catcher _dash_ in that direction at x2.0 speed (indicated with a **bright glow** from the catcher).

The placement of in-game cursor does not matter when playing normally. If [Relax][Relax wikilink] mod was enabled, the control of the catcher will be the in-game cursor instead. However, this will make the play unrankable (as it defeats the only challenge of osu!catch; fixed catcher speed and catcher plate control).

### What is osu!mania?
_Full explanation: [osu!mania][osu!mania wikilink]_

![osu!mania Interface][osu!mania Interface image]

_In-game interface of osu!mania_

osu!mania is the third game mode added to osu!, after osu!taiko and osu!catch game modes.

This mode has been widely used in almost all of the major rhythm games. It require good hand and/or leg coordination where the notes (with their quantity depending on BPM and difficulty) move on a conveyer. With this, the player will have to press the correct key for that specific note in time. Though the game mode was originally made as an imitation of the Beatmania style of playing, osu!mania allows changing the number of keys (this means it can be made to look more like Guitar Hero \[5 keys\] or Dance Dance Revolution \[4 keys\] and so on).

When converting an osu!standard beatmap, the default key range would be around 4 to 7 keys. With the [xK][xK wikilink] game modifier, the player can manually set the number of keys from 1 to a total of 9 keys with a score multiplier reduction. However, this game modifier will not work with osu!mania-specific beatmaps. With the [Co-Op][Co-Op wikilink] game modifier, the stage will be split in two. This will use Co-Op's control scheme and will allows the player to play from 2 to a total of 18 keys with a score multiplier reduction. Do note that while the preset number of keys will not be doubled on osu!mania-specific beatmaps, it will split the stage in two (left stage priority if odd-numbered), use Co-Op's control scheme, and no score multiplier reduction.

#### Basic explanation
##### Playfield
![osu!mania playfield][osu!mania playfield image]

_In-game playfield interface of osu!catch_

By default, the flow of the notes falls from top to bottom of the convenyor (the starting arrow will show where notes will flow to), with the key control at the bottom and the judgement barline above the key control. To reverse the control and flow of the playfield, it can be changed in the Options sidebar; click on _osu!mania layout_ button to set osu!mania keys settings and enable _Vertically flip playfield (DDR style)_ for this key setting manually.

Healthbar is located at the right side of the conveyor belt. Please note that health drain is disabled in osu!mania, so only the hitobjects will affect the healthbar. Combo will not break when playing the keys on empty judgement barline.

**Scrolling speed of the beat notes** can be changed by pressing `Ctrl` (or `Shift`) with `+` (faster) / `-` (slower) while playing or while in song selection menu. Alternatively, `F3` (faster) or `F4` (slower) during gameplay only.

##### Notes
![osu!mania's notes][osu!mania notes image]

_A typical play with consecutive and simultaneous notes_

Notes are the hitcircles of osu!mania. The falling notes must be tapped on the judgement line, with correct key corresponding to each of the note it falls to. More keys corresponding to the falling notes must be tapped simultaneously if the notes fall simultaneously.

##### Holdnotes
![osu!mania's holdnotes][osu!mania holdnotes image]

_A typical play with some holdnotes_

Holdnotes are the sliders and spinners of osu!mania. When the holdnote reaches the judgement line, tap the starting note in time with correct key, hold, and release it at the ending note of the holdnote.

Healthbar regeneration occurs slowly while holding the holdnote(s). Depending on the song and mapping quirks, it is possible that other notes or holdnotes will appear while holding the holdnote(s).

#### Controls
![Default Key layouts of osu!mania (Options-&gt;Input)][osu!mania key layout image]

There two different binding-styles, _Symmetrical_ and _Left to Right_.
- _Symmetrical_ style mimics the button placement of DJMAX, in which the center key is `Spacebar` to simulate a feeling of stepping the pedal similar to the arcade version. Centre key matches the middle column (odd numbered keys only) and the other column matches the keys in its corresponding place.
- _Left to Right_ style mimics the button placement of Beatmania IIDX, where the first column matches to the key1, then the second column matches the key2 and so on.

_Symmetrical_ key binding (For DJMAX style)
- For _left_ hand buttons — (K1)`A`, (K2)`S`, (K3)`D`, (K4)`F`
- For _right_ hand buttons — (K6)`J`, (K7)`K`, (K8)`L`, (K9)`;`.
- *Center* button — (K5)`Spacebar`. \[On 5K and 7K only\]
- The _Special_ button — `leftShift` and `leftCtrl`.

  - However, if replaying an SS'ed difficulty and gained a new highscore (from better spinner bonus or game modifiers bonus) but was an S, then the SS counter will decrement by one and S counter increment by one instead.

## Performance Points
_Full explanation: [Performance Points][Performance Points wikilink]_

Performance points (pp) is a ranking metric aiming to be more contextually relevant to a continuous game like osu!. It aims to shift the focus from being on the amount of time played to the actual skill of the player. Performance points is heavily based on map difficulty, determined by a unique algorithm in every game mode. Based on this difficulty alone, each of the scores will be rated and assigned a pp value. Performance rank is predominantly based on performance on individual maps. The easiest way to improve it is to score high on difficult songs, and playing more songs. Do note that game modes are counted separately; playing osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania will raise the pp for the respective game mode.

For any questions regarding pp, please refer to the [wiki page for pp first][Performance Points#FAQ wikilink].

## Common issues and questions

### General
#### Where can I find and get the beatmaps?
_Detailed explanation of the beatmaps: [Beatmaps][Beatmaps wikilink]_

You can find it from the main page under the name _[Beatmaps][Beatmaplist link]_. Just remember to log in to your osu! account beforehand or the server will treat you as a guest and will not let you to download beatmaps from the site.

#### Can I disable Kiai Time?
**No**, because unlike video, it is integrated to the game (as a part with the hit objects), thus cannot be disabled.

#### The maps are too hard! Where can I find some easier maps?
For osu! gamemode, Pokebis has compiled a set of beatmaps suitable for beginners to play. You can find them here: <https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/5456>

For osu!taiko gamemode, OnosakiHito has compiled a set of beatmaps for beginners to learn osu!taiko. You can find it here: <https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/175867>

For osu!catch gamemode, Kingkevin30 has compiled a nice list of osu!catch beatmaps and basic explanation about osu!catch. You can find it here: <https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/131067>

For osu!mania gamemode, Entozer has compiled a decent list sorted by relative player's difficulties. You can find it here: <https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/147552>

Also, [the ranked beatmap version of osu! tutorial][osu!tutorial rank] is good for practicing some of the possible mapping design you will come across. It is an excellent training map for newbies and experienced players.

Alternatively, you can [sort the ranked beatmap list by difficulty][sort beatmaplist difficulty]. The easiest maps are at the top of the list.

#### What does Level in my profile actually do?
**Absolutely nothing**. There is no difference in any way when comparing a Level 100 player against a Level 1 player except the player's own skills and experience of the game mode in question. There is no handicap for the lower level nor is there an advantage for the higher level (except personal experience and hardware used).

Level will be based on total score accumulated when online with account regardless of pass or fail on the beatmap. [Formula given here][Score#Level wikilink].

#### Why is my profile stats different ingame?
Keep in mind that osu! has four game modes so you might be looking at the wrong game mode.

![Profile_Mode_Buttons][Profile_Mode_Buttons image]

_Manually select the game mode at your profile that you want to view._

#### How do I change the default keyboard key input for my game mode of choice?
![Options sidebar with quickicons][Options quickicons image]

From the _Input_ icon in the _Options_ sidebar as shown above, under **Keyboard** section as shown below.

![Options keyboard section][Options keyboard image]

#### Game over? Where did I messed up?
_Full explanation: [Replay][Replay wikilink]_

Press the `F1` key to replay the currently failed play. The replay ends when the screen darkens, with an osu!logo in the middle, rather than the game over screen. To rewatch the replay again, hold the custom default grave/tilde (`` `/~ ``) key (can be changed in Options sidebar; inside _Change keyboard bindings_ as **Quick Retry (hold briefly)**) or `Ctrl`+`R` for a while.

Due to the non-standard replay screen, use the `Esc` key to return to Song Selection. Retrying the play (as in, actual play) of the beatmap in this state is not possible. It currently works in Solo mode only when given the game over screen. **This replay will not be saved nor allowed to be exported.** To record the failed replay, please use external third-party software for now since osu! has yet to have native export support for failed replay.

#### Does osu! has keyboard shortcuts?
_Full list: [Shortcut Key Reference][Shortcut Key Reference wikilink]_

Pressing the `Insert` key (in default keyboard setting) will hide, pause (if playing) and mute osu! into the Windows sidebar. Find the osu!logo in the Windows sidebar, and click on it to return osu! to the state before pressing the key. It is called the _Boss key_, and can be modified in _Change keyboard bindings_ (in Options, under Keyboard section), located at the end of the Universal section.

Another interesting shortcut is `Alt`+`Enter`. This shortcut toggles the fullscreen mode button in Options, but does not work during gameplay or in Multi.

#### What should I backup when fresh installing osu! on a new device?
The whole `osu!` folder, including hidden files, is the short answer. On the new device after running `osu!install.exe` and completing osu! installation successfully, copy the backup `osu!` folder and merge to the new device's `osu!` folder. If it ask for merging `.dll` or `.exe` files, ignore it. Allow merging for everything else, including `.cfg` and `.db` files.

### osu!
#### Why am I seeing random white lines on screen every time I play?
Make sure that the smoke/skywriting key binding is not the same as the key binding used to tap with when playing.

![osu! smoke effect][osu_smoke image]

_Usage of Smoke_

![osu! smoke settings][osu_smoke_set image]

_Smoke in key bindings settings; hold `C` key to trigger by default in osu!_

#### Why do I not have the max possible combo when I have no misses?
![Image showing a slider with sliderticks, with top part during Edit and bottom part during play][Sliderticks image]

_Top image shows a slider with all the sliderticks shown in Edit mode; Bottom image shows the same slider during play, with some sliderticks obstructed by start and end circle of the slider._

**You released a slider early (meaning that you released the ball before it had finished the ending slider point).**

A slider is composed of a starting circle point, spaced smaller circles known as sliderticks, reverse arrow points (if used, it will be treated as starting point instead; it is a proper slider in reverse), and an ending circle point. Each of those points on a slider will add one to your combo. Note that the starting circle point is worth 30 points, the sliderticks are worth 10 points each, the reverse arrow points are worth 30 points each, and the end circle point is worth 300 (or geki), 100 (or katu), or 50 points depending on how the slider was completed.

Sliderticks only appears inside its own sliderpath; if the sliderticks are too close to the start or end circle as shown in the image above, it will be hidden inside the start or end circle. Hidden sliderticks still counts into combo and score, so it must be collected along with the visible sliderticks. If the slider has one or more reverse arrow points, then the sliderticks will reappear at the same place to be collected in reverse.

If miss the timing to tap the starting circle point, miss the sliderticks, or miss the reverse arrow points, combo will break (it should trigger a combo break sound when the combo is high enough) but it is not considered a miss. However, if miss the ending circle point, combo does not break and does not increment by 1. It is also not considered a miss; instead, a 100 (or katu for end of the combo) will be given for the entire slider, assuming at least started the slider properly, and completed all the sliderticks/reverse arrow points when given. Notably, [Sudden Death][Sudden Death wikilink] game mod will not trigger its effect of immediate game over when missing the ending circle point (since the combo did not break, the Sudden Death effect was not triggered).

These situations, caused by a slider, are collectively called sliderbreak. A max combo play can be known by checking the result screen for the _Perfect_ notice on the performance graph; not having the _Perfect_ notice, especially without misses, usually means that one or more sliderbreak occurred during play.

### osu!taiko
#### What does "Use Taiko skin for Taiko mode" in Options under Skin section do?
This button only works if a folder named `taiko` (capitalisation does not matter) inside the `Skins` folder of the `osu!` file directory existed.

When enabled, it will use the `taiko` folder's skin elements when playing in osu!taiko, regardless of current skin's taiko elements. If the `taiko` folder was not found, or disabled, it will use the current skin's taiko elements when available; default if all/certain taiko skin element was not found.

Ancient trivia note: `taiko` folder used to hold _[Taiko by LuiginHann][Taiko by LuigiHann link]_ skin, which could be downloaded from the now-deprecated `osume.exe` (an osu! updater when osu! need to update) under Skin tab. As the button does not check whether the folder contains elements from LuigiHann's skin, it was quickly noted by the community and used as a personal global osu!taiko skin folder.

### Beatmapping
#### "This beatmap you're trying to submit isn't owned by you!"
_For unranked beatmaps only._

![Example of an .osu file content][Beatmap_not_owned image]

Please follow these steps:-

1. Leave the editor (or close osu!) to make sure the changes apply properly
2. Check the name of the beatmap's folder
   - If it starts with numbers, remove them. Otherwise, osu! will treat it as BeatmapSetID
3. Make sure that the .mp3 does not start with numbers. Edit the filename in the .osu files if it does.
4. Open all the .osu files with a text editor (Notepad will work)
   - Set your name as creator (and replace it in the file name as well)
   - Set the BeatmapID to 0
   - Set the BeatmapSetID to -1
