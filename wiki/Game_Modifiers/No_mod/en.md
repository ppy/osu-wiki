## Description

**No mod** (NM) is a term used to describe a play that does not use any [game modifiers](/wiki/Game_Modifiers). The term is most commonly used in [tournaments](/wiki/Tournaments) to distinguish certain categories or restrictions, but can also be used to distinguish certain types of players or plays.

Regarding usage of the term among everyday, common players, it is used to define plays and players. For example, one could call a player who typically enjoys playing with no game modifiers enabled (and/or has many of their top plays use no mods) a "no mod player" (similar to calling a player a "DT player"). While in other instances, some other players may use the term to say that they are "good at no mod" as a way to say that they typically obtain better scores without the use of mods.
