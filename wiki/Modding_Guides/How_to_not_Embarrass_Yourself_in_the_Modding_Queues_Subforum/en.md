How to not Embarrass Yourself in the Modding Queues Subforum
=============================================================

So osu!forums has this subforum as many know as **[Modding Queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/60)**. It might seem intimidating at first but here are the tips and tricks on **How to not Embarrass Yourself in the Modding Queues Subforum**.

Do NOT Abuse This Subforum
--------------------------

Since it apparently wasn't obvious, nobody is ever to spam this board with requests. If you have posted in 10 queues in a row, you're probably at a good stopping point. If your username runs down the list of "Last post by" column, you're probably going to lose your privilege to post here.

So yeah, no flooding. If you are seen to have made more than 5 consecutive("consecutive" meaning within a few hours - hell, let's say 12) posts in this sub forum, you will be placed on a modding queue mod queue. If you then decide to spam the mod queue with your modding queue spam, you will most likely be banned.

This thread (link above) should suffice as fair warning.

Do not make a new thread for your beatmap
-----------------------------------------

Post it in one of the existing modding queue threads.
