# Combo Fire

![Ancient screenshot of the combo fire](/wiki/shared/combo-fire.jpg "R.I.P. combo fire")

**Combo fire** was a background gameplay element that originated from the [osu! Tatake Ouendan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan "Wikipedia") DS Game that eventually got integrated into osu!. This would display a burning, yellow flame after obtaining a [combo milestone](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_Milestone). If the player obtained a [combo](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_Score_Multiplier) of 500x, the combo fire would change colour from yellow to blue. The fire would extinguish if the combo was broken, but would be reobtainable if combo was regained.

*Notice: Combo fire was disabled on March 5, 2013 due to performance concerns.*
