# Time-distance equality

*Time-distance equality* is the idea that spacing between [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) is proportional to the duration of time between them. Also known as using a **constant distance spacing**. This idea is especially useful for lower difficulties like Easy and Normals where variable spacing may throw off players.

To ensure time-distance equality on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) the `Distance Snap` button on the right-hand side of the [editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor) can be turned on. You can change distance snapping values by holding down `Alt` and sliding the selector at the top-right or by scrolling the mousewheel. Note that higher values will have the player move their mouse farther.
