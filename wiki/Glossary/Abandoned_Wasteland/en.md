# Abandoned Wasteland

The *Abandoned Wasteland* is a hidden sub-forum where old and abandoned forums are laid to rest. This sub-forum is only accessible to moderators who have the power to modify the forums. The instructions to moderators concerning it is: "Put stuff we do not really need in here." When a forumthread is said to be "wastelanded", it means that is moved here.
