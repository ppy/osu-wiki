# Futsuu

A **Futsuu** difficulty is for players who understood the very basics in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) and are ready to go one step forward. Here for the first time, the player is getting confronted **with 1/2 notes** and **different spacings**, which are the basic entry to **Muzukashii** and **Oni**. Together with 2/1 patterns, there can be also an usage of 1/4 and even 1/2, depending on the song. But even so, 1/2 should be used sparingly and only in songs which are intended to be the hardest level of Futsuu. So mapping to the beat becomes more significant at this point but shouldn't be overtaken. That means, a Futsuu can follow a songs beat or vocal but should contain enough 2/1 spacings to give the player the possibility to prepare themself for the upcoming patterns.

Also Note: 1/4 notes are still meant for Muzukashii, but can be used in Futsuu; for example when the BPM of a song is really low.

## Guidelines

One of the easier difficulties which generally follows the most distinctive **features** of a song. Use of 1/2 notes is encouraged as well if the song allows it, but as harder patterns become, the more **rest moments** should be used. **Beat placement should be mostly consistent** to teach beginners the correlation between timing and distance. Spinners can be shorter, but should have plenty of breaks to the upcoming note.

Difficulty setup should include a **high up to really high drain rate** and *low / medium hit accuracy* (OD: 4~5). The **slider velocity is 1.4** but should be lowered on really high BPMs to allow beginner having enough time to plan the next move without cluttering the screen with too many hit objects.

And try to avoid these:

-   too short spinners
-   slider velocity changes
-   too long pattern constellations, especially on 1/2 snapping

-   Usage of 1/2 notes
-   **2/1 spacings available**
-   01:14:305 (8) - Long slider.

[Halozy - Serenade of Love (Futsuu) (OnosakiHito)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/203303)

-   Usage of 1/2 notes
-   **2/1 spacings available**
-   Appearance of 1/4 notes in form of doublets(on very low BPMs this can be allowed)
-   Beat-wise mapping

## Conclusion

Even if a Futsuu can carry 1/2 notes, they should not be overused. Avoid too long patterns and have enough breaks and 1/1 notes.
