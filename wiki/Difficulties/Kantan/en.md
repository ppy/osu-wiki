# Kantan

A **Kantan** difficulty is, in general, the entry point for new players who come for the first time with the game [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) in touch. That means, these people are not familiar with the game and need to learn the basics of it: **How to hit the notes** and facing for the first time **easy pattern constellations**. To achieve this, you have to map mostly (not only) independently of the songs beat or vocal, since these are often used uneven which the beginner can't handle well enough. In that meaning: Typical for a Kantan is the usage of 1/1 notes and 2/1 spaces or above, which gives the new player the possibility to prepare himself for the next patterns.

## Guidelines

Easiest difficulty in a mapset which follows the most distinctive **beat** of a song. Try having in a **consistent way** a sufficient amount of rest moments, especially when patterns become more alternative and complicated. Monotonically patterns though are not always in the need of rest moments because of their easy appearance. Spinners should be only used on long sounds to teach beginner how to play these while sliders can be put on shorter sounds.

Difficulty setup should include a **really high drain rate** and **low hit accuracy** (OD: 3~4). The **slider velocity is 1.4** but should be lowered on really high BPMs to allow beginner having enough time to plan the next move without cluttering the screen with too many hit objects.

And try to avoid these:

-   [Short Spinners](/wiki/Mapping_Techniques/Spinner/Short_Spinners)
-   slider velocity changes
-   odd patterns
-   too long constellations with hard patterns

## Examples

[PON & Makino Mizuta - WO AI NI (Kantan) (MMzz)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/284900)

-   Mostly a usage of **monotonically patterns.**
-   Easy beat-wise mapping at 00:02:951 (4) - with a big space afterwards.
-   Many **spacings**

## Conclusion

A Kantan contains not many notes, and even the 1/1 are not frequently used.
