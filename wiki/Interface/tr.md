## Ana Menü

![](img/Introscreen.jpg "Ana Menü")

[osu!cookie](/wiki/Glossary#cookie) \[1\] ana menü üzerinde o anda çalan şarkının [BPM](/wiki/Beatmapping/Beats_per_minute)'ine göre titreşir. Ek olarak, şarkının ses seviyesine göre osu!cookie'nin dışına doğru çubuklar çıkar. Eğer hiç bir şarkı çalmıyorsa, 60 BPM hızında titreşir. Ana menüyü oluşturan elemanlar aşağıdaki gibidir:

- \[2\] Solo modu şarkı seçim ekranına geçmek için Play'e (`P`) veya logoya tıklayın.
- \[3\] Düzenleyici modu şarkı seçim ekranına geçmek için Edit'e (`E`) tıklayın.
- \[4\] Ayarlar ekranına gitmek için Options'a (`O`) tıklayın.
- \[5\] osu!'dan çıkmak için Exit'e (`Esc`) tıklayın.
- \[6\] Menünün alt kısmında işe yarar rastgele bir tavsiye görüntülenir.
- \[7\] Sol-alt kısımda osu! web sayfasına bir link, aynı zamanda telif hakkı bilgisi bulunur.
- \[8\] [Bancho](/wiki/Glossary#bancho)'ya bağlantı sonucu! Bu resimde gösterilmiyor, ama bağlantı sonucu bir dizi linke benziyor.
- \[9\] Sağ-alt kısımda genişletilmiş [sohbet penceresi](/wiki/Chat_Console) (burada "Player List" olarak geçiyor) ve sıradan sohbet penceresi (sırasıyla `F9` & `F8`) için sohbet kontrolleri bulunur.
- \[10\] Sağ-üstte şarkıları rastgele sırayla çalan osu! müzik kutusu bulunur. Üst kısım şu anda çalan şarkıyı gösterir. Butonlar, soldan sağa aşağıdaki gibi çalışır:
  - Önceki Parça
  - Oynat
  - Duraklat
  - Durdur (Duraklat ve Durdur arasındaki fark Durdur şarkıyı sil baştan sıfırlarken, Duraklat sadece şarkıyı duraklatır)
  - Sonraki Parça
  - Şarkı Bilgisini Gör. Bu üstteki çubukta şarkı bilgisini kalıcı veya geçici gösterme arasında geçiş yapar. Kalıcı olduğunda, bilgi çubuğu arayüzün geri kalanıyla birlikte kaybolana kadar görünür. Geçici olduğunda, şarkı seçildikten bir süre sonra kaybolur. Tekrar ayarlanana, ya da başka bir şarkı çalana kadar gizli kalır.
- \[11\] Sahip olduğunuz beatmaplerin sayısı, osu! istemcinizin ne kadar süredir çalıştığı, ve sizin sistem saatiniz.
- \[12\] Profiliniz, Kullanıcı Seçenekleri'ni (aşağıda) görüntülemek için üzerine tıklayın.

## Song Selection Screen

![](img/Soloplay1.jpg "Song Selection")

You can identify the current mode selected by either looking at the icon in the bottom right, above Mode, or by looking at the transparent icon in the center of the screen. These are the four you will see:

- ![](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) is [osu!](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!)
- ![](/wiki/shared/mode/taiko.png) is [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko)
- ![](/wiki/shared/mode/catch.png) is [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch)
- ![](/wiki/shared/mode/mania.png) is [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania)

Before continuing on, this screen has too many elements to note with easily, noticeable numbers. The subsections below will focus on one part of the screen at a time, starting from the top down and left to right.

### Beatmap Information

![](img/Soloplay2.jpg)

![](img/Soloplay2.5.jpg)

This area displays **information on the beatmap difficulty currently selected.** By default, the beatmap whose song is heard in the osu! jukebox is selected when entering the selection screen. In the top left is the ranked status of the beatmap. The title is next. Normally, the romanised title is shown, but if you select `Prefer metadata in original language` in the [Options](/wiki/Options), it will show the Unicode title; this is shown in the upper picture. The beatmapper is also shown, and beatmap information is shown below. From left to right, the values are as follows:

- **Length**: The total length of the beatmap, from start to finish and including breaks. Not to be confused with [drain time](/wiki/Glossary#drain-time).
- **BPM**: The BPM of the beatmap. If (like in the lower picture) there are two BPMS and one in parentheses, this means that the BPM changes throughout the song. It shows the slowest and fastest BPMs, and the value in parentheses is the BPM at the start of the beatmap.
- **Objects**: The total amount of [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) in the beatmap.
- **Circles**: The total amount of hit circles in the beatmap.
- **Sliders**: The total amount of sliders in the beatmap.
- **Spinners**: The total amount of spinners in the beatmap.
- **OD**: The Overall Difficulty of the beatmap.
- **HP**: The drain rate of your HP. In osu!, this is how much of an HP loss you receive upon missing a note, how fast the life bar idly drains, and how much HP is received for hitting a note. In osu!mania, this is the same except there is no idle HP drain. In osu!taiko, this determines how slowly the HP bar fills and how much HP is lost when a note is missed. osu!catch is the same as osu!.
- **Stars**: The star difficulty of the beatmap. This is graphically visible in the beatmap rectangle itself.

### Group and Sort

![](img/Soloplay3.jpg)

Click on one of the tabs to **sort your song list according to the selected criterion**.

**Group** - Most options organize beatmaps into various expandable groups:

- `No grouping` - Beatmaps will not be grouped but will still be sorted in the order specified by Sort.
- `By Difficulty` - Beatmaps will be grouped by their star difficulty, rounded to the nearest whole number.
- `By Artist` - Beatmaps will be grouped by the artist's first character of their name.
- `Recently Played` - Beatmaps will be grouped by when you last played them.
- `Collections` - This will show the collections you have created. *Note that this will hide beatmaps not listed in a collection!*
- `By BPM` - Beatmaps will be grouped according to BPM in multiples of 60, starting at 120.
- `By Creator` - Beatmaps will be grouped by the beatmap creator's name's first character.
- `By Date` Added - Beatmaps will be grouped according to when they were added, from today to 4+ months ago.
- `By Length` - Beatmaps will be grouped according to their length: 1 minute or less, 2 minutes or less, 3, 4, 5, and 10.
- `By Mode` - Beatmaps will be grouped according to their game mode.
- `By Rank Achieved` - Beatmaps will be sorted by the highest rank achieved on them.
- `By Title` - Beatmaps will be grouped by the first letter of their title.
- `Favourites` - Only beatmaps you have favorited online will be shown.
- `My Maps` - Only beatmaps you have mapped (that is, whose creator matches your profile name) will be shown.
- `Ranked Status` - Beatmaps will be grouped by their ranked status: ranked, pending, not submitted, unknown, or loved.
The first five groupings are available in tabs below Group and Sort.

**Sort** - Sorts beatmaps in a certain order

- `By Artist` - Beatmaps will be sorted alphabetically by the artist's name's first character.
- `By BPM` - Beatmaps will be sorted lowest to highest by their BPM. For maps with multiple BPMs, the highest will be used.
- `By Creator` - Beatmaps will be sorted alphabetically by the creator's name's first character.
- `By Date Added` - Beatmaps will be sorted from oldest to newest by when they were added.
- `By Difficulty` - Beatmaps will be sorted from easiest to hardest by star difficulty. *Note that this will split apart mapsets!*
- `By Length` - Beatmaps will be sorted from shortest to longest by length.
- `By Rank Achieved` - Beatmaps will be sorted from poorest to best by the highest rank achieved on them.
- `By Title` - Beatmaps will be sorted alphabetically by the first character of their name.

### Search

![](img/Soloplay5.jpg)

*Note: You cannot have the chat console or the options sidebar open if you want to search; otherwise, anything you type will be perceived as chat text or as an options search query.*

Only beatmaps that match the criteria of your search will be shown. By default, any search will be matched against the beatmaps' artists, titles, creators, and tags.

In addition to searching these fields, you can use filters to search through other metadata by combining one of the supported filters with a comparison to a value (for example, `ar=9`).

Supported filters:

- `artist`: Name of the artist
- `creator`: Name of the beatmap creator
- `ar`: Approach Rate
- `cs`: Circle Size
- `od`: Overall Difficulty
- `hp`: HP Drain Rate
- `keys`: Number of keys (osu!mania maps only)
- `stars`: Star Difficulty
- `bpm`: Beats per minute
- `length`: Length in seconds
- `drain`: Drain Time in seconds
- `mode`: Mode. Value can be `osu`, `taiko`, `catchthebeat`, or `mania`, or `o`/`t`/`c`/`m` for short.
- `status`: Ranked status. Value can be `ranked`, `approved`, `pending`, `notsubmitted`, `unknown`, or `loved`, or `r`/`a`/`p`/`n`/`u`/`l` for short.
- `played`: Time since last played in days
- `unplayed`: Unplayed maps. No value (use `unplayed=` for unplayed maps or `unplayed!=` for played maps)
- `speed`: Saved osu!mania scroll speed. Always 0 for unplayed maps or if the [Remember osu!mania scroll speed per beatmap](/wiki/Options#gameplay) option is off

Supported comparisons:

- `=` or `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `<`: Less than
- `>`: Greater than
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to

You may also enter a beatmap or beatmapset ID in your search to get a single result.

### Rankings

![](img/Soloplay10.jpg)

 A variety of things can appear in this space:

- A "Not Submitted" box denotes a beatmap that has not been uploaded to the osu! site using the Beatmap Submission System.
- An "Update to latest version" box appears if there is a new version of the beatmap available for download. Click on the button to update.
  - **Note:** Once you update the beatmap, it cannot be reversed. If you want to preserve the older version for some reason (say, to keep scores), then do not update.
- A "Latest pending version" box appears means that the beatmap has been uploaded to the osu!website but is not ranked yet.
- If replays matching the view setting of the beatmap exist, they will be displayed instead of a box denoting the ranked/played status of the beatmap. This is shown in the above picture.
  - Under public rankings (e.g. Global, Friends, etc.), your high score will be shown at the bottom, as well as your rank on the leaderboard.
- A "No records set!" box means that there are no replays for the current view setting (this is typically seen in the Local view setting if you just downloaded or edited the beatmap).
  - Note: Scores for Multi are not counted as records.

These are the view settings:

- Local Ranking
- Country Ranking\*
- Global Ranking
- Global Ranking (Selected Mods)\*
- Friend Ranking\*

\*Requires you to be an [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) to access them.

Click the word bubble icon to call up the **Quick Web Access** screen for the selected beatmap:

- Press `1` or click the `Beatmap Listing/Scores` button and your default internet browser will pull up the Beatmap Listing and score page of the beatmap set the selected beatmap belongs to.
- Press `2` or click `Beatmap Topic` and your default itnternet browser will pull up the forum thread of the beatmap set the selected beatmap belongs to.
- Press `3` or click `Quick Reply` and your default internet browser will pull up a page where you can compose a reply to the forum thread of the beatmap set the selected beatmap belongs to.
- Press `4` or `Esc` or click `Cancel` to return to the Song Selection Screen.

While you are on the Quick Web Access Screen, you cannot access the Chat and Extended Chat Consoles.

### Song

![](img/Soloplay6.jpg)

The song list displays all available beatmaps. Different beatmaps may have different coloured boxes:

- **Pink**: This beatmap has not been played yet.
- **Orange**: This beatmap has been played, or all beatmaps in this mapset have been played.
- **Light Blue**: Other beatmaps in the same set, shown when a mapset is expanded.
- **White**: Currently selected beatmap.

You can navigate the beatmap list by using the mouse wheel, using the up and down arrow keys, dragging it while holding the left mouse button or clicking the right mouse button (previously known as Absolute Scrolling), which will move the scroll bar to your mouse's Y position. Click on a box to select that beatmap and display its information on the upper left, high scores (if any) on the left and, if you've cleared it, the letter grade of the highest score you've achieved. Click the box again, press `Enter` or click the osu!cookie at the lower right to begin playing the beatmap.

### Gameplay toolbox

![](img/Mode_screen.png "List of available game modes")

![](img/Soloplay7.jpg)

This section can be called the gameplay toolbox. We will cover each button's use from left to right.

Press `Esc` or click the `Back` button to return to main menu.

Click on the `Mode` button to open up a list of gameplay modes available on osu!. Click on your desired gameplay mode and osu! will switch to that gameplay mode style - the scoreboard will change accordingly. Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl` and `1` (osu!), `2` (osu!taiko), `3` (osu!catch), or `4` (osu!mania) to change the gamemode.

The background transparent icon and the "Mode" box will change to depict what mode is currently selected.

![](img/Soloplay8.png "Game modifiers")

Click the `Mods` button or press `F1` to open the **[Mod Selection Screen](/wiki/Game_Modifiers)**.

In this screen, you can apply modifications ("mods" for short) to gameplay. Some mods lower difficulty and apply a multiplier that lowers the score you achieve. Conversely, some mods increase the difficulty, but apply a multiplier that increases the score you achieve. Finally, some mods modify gameplay in a different way. [Relax](/wiki/Game_Modifiers#relax) and [Auto Pilot](/wiki/Game_Modifiers#auto-pilot) fall in that category.
Place your mouse on a mod's icon to see a short description of its effect. Click on an icon to select or deselect that mod. Some mods, like Double Time, have multiple variations; click on the mod again to cycle through. The score multiplier value displays the combined effect the multipliers of the mod(s) of you have selected will have on your score. Click "Reset all mods" or press 1 to deselect all currently selected mods. Click `Close` or press `2` or `Esc` to return to the Song Selection Screen.

While you are on the Mod Selection Screen, you cannot access the Chat and Extended Chat Consoles. In addition, skins can alter the text and/or icon of the mods, but the effects will still be the same.

Click the `Random` button or press `F2` to have the game **randomly scroll through all of your beatmaps and pick one.** You cannot select a beatmap yourself until it has finished scrolling.

*Note: You can press `Shift` + the `Random` button or `F2` to go back to the beatmap you had selected before you randomized your selection.*

![](img/Soloplay9.jpg "Possible commands for a beatmap")

Click the `Beatmap Options` button or press `F3` or right-click from mouse to call up the **Beatmap Options Menu for options on the currently selected beatmap**.

- Press `1` or click the `Manage Collections` button to bring up the Collections screen - here, you can manage pre-existing collections, as well as add or remove the currently selected beatmap or mapset to or from a collection.
- Press `2` or click `Delete...` to delete the \[1\] currently selected mapset, \[2\] delete the currently selected beatmap, or \[3\] delete all beatmaps. The last option is a joke; clicking it will cause the game to notify you that you can't delete all of your beatmaps at once.
  - Note that deleted beatmaps are moved to the Recycle Bin.
- Press `3` or click `Remove from Unplayed` to mark an unplayed beatmap as played (that is, change its box colour from pink to orange).
- Press `4` or click `Clear local scores` to delete all records of the scores you have achieved in this beatmap.
- Press `5` or click `Edit` to open the selected beatmap in osu!'s Editor.
- Press `6` or `Esc` or click `Close` to return to the Song Selection Screen.

Click on **your user panel** to access the **User Options Menu**.

Click the **[osu!cookie](/wiki/Glossary#cookie)** to **start playing the selected beatmap**.

![](img/Accuracy_CtB.jpg "Accuracy in osu!catch")

### Online Leaderboard

![](img/Osu!_Online_score.jpg "Right: Example of an osu!online score. (6) was edited in.")

This is your online leaderboard. You can go here by scrolling down from the results screen. Your Local Scoreboard will show your name and the score as usual.

1. You can change the name to record for this replay here.
2. Your player bar. It shows your [PP](/wiki/Performance_Points), Global Rank, Total Score, Overall [Accuracy](/wiki/Accuracy), and level bar.
3. Your options regarding the Beatmap.
   1. Export Replay as `.osr`: Save the replay that can be used online.
   2. Online Favourite: Make the Beatmap as your Online Favourite. It will show on your online profile under Beatmaps->Favourite Beatmaps
4. Here is the difference made to your profile. This shows how far you've moved up or down the Global Ranking, how much was added to your Total Score, and how much your Overall Accuracy changed. The text fades out rather quickly, so don't miss it!
5. Self-explanatory. Will not appear if offline, or if the beatmap is not uploaded.
   1. Map Rank: Your Ranking on the map. The ranking includes replays that featured mods, even if you didn't use any yourself.
   2. Overall: Your profile standing on the gamemode you just played, not just the beatmap.
   3. Accuracy: Will only be counted when your old score is surpassed. Accuracy is the average of all passed beatmaps.
   4. Ranked Score: Your Ranked Score. If it's an approved song, it will not increase at all.
   5. Total Score: Grand total score. This will always increase even if you fail or don't surpass a high score in a beatmap. This counts towards your level.
   6. To Next Rank: How much score you need to move your current map ranking position up.
6. Same as #4, but it is reserved for monthly [Ranking Charts](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/osu/charts)
7. Beatmap song with its history of plays and pass rate.
8. Beatmap Rating. Use your personal discretion based on whether you enjoy the beatmap or not. Best left alone if you can't decide.
9. Return to Song Selection.
