# Silence

**Silence** is a term used to describe the punishment of limiting a user's means of communication within the osu! community. Silences can be placed by members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) and [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team), and are only placed on users that have broken the [Community Rules](/wiki/Rules).

## Limitations

Users who are silenced by moderators cannot do the following:

- Edit their userpage
- Change their avatar/profile details <!-- unconfirmed on new site, but was a thing on old -->
- Submit [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps)
- Send/receive private messages
- Post on any of the osu! forums

## Common reasons for silences

*Caution: Engaging in "inappropriate behaviour" in private messages is not against the rules, unless said inappropriate behaviour is being delivered to unwilling or unconsenting recipients in said private messages. If reported, appropriate punishments will be placed.*

- Inappropriate behaviour in public chats or forums (e.g, `#multiplayer`, beatmap discussions, comments, etc.), including—but not limited to—spamming, nonsense chat, racism, etc.
- Uploading or posting inappropriate content via other means. (E.g., profile avatars, beatmap submissions, profile details, user page bio, banner, etc.).

The length of a silence may vary based on the severity of the infringement. Silences can stack on top of each other, adding more time for each one.
