**[puush.me](https://puush.me)**, often referred to as **puush**, is a screenshot sharing service run and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) and ::{ flag=AU }:: [nekodex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102). First launched in June 2010, the service serves as a successor to [upppy](/wiki/upppy) with a greater focus on screen sharing and user data management. It was created out of necessity as an existing service that the two founders were using added heavy advertising and removed direct image hotlinking support.

## Service

puush allows for users to upload screenshots and files to their personal accounts using a dedicated [Windows](https://puush.me/dl/puush-installer.exe), [Mac OS](https://puush.me/dl/puush.zip), or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/puush/id386524126?mt=8) application. Once uploaded, these files can then be managed from the puush.me website, put into "pools" (photo albums), or shared elsewhere using an easily shareable `puu.sh` link.

A core feature of puush is its ability to capture and share screenshots instantly, which makes it particularly popular among [modders](/wiki/Modding). As puush is intended for sharing files, not as a permanent file storage, uploaded files are only retained for a limited amount of time before they are deleted.

## Subscription

While puush was available to everyone free of charge, in order to keep the service self-sufficient, puush offered a "Pro" plan that users could subscribe to for US$15/year.[^puush-pro-plan-ref] This plan came with a couple of extra benefits for the subscribing user, namely:

- Increased maximum filesize limit (20 MB for Free users vs. 250 MB for Pro users)
- Increased file retention period (1 months since last access for Free users vs. 6 months since last access for Pro users)

Similar to osu!, all puush users are not subjected to any ads regardless of their subscription status.

## Downscaling

Starting from March 2014, puush no longer accepts registrations for the Pro plan as PayPal suspended puush's account due to an unforeseen "Terms of Service breach".[^puush-paypal-suspension-ref] This resulted in ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) having to cover the ~$400 per month out of his own pocket to keep the service running.[^puush-finances-ref]

Later that year, as the maintenance for puush comes to a halt, puush disabled registrations for all new accounts altogether â€” although existing users may continue to use the service as usual.[^puush-maintenance-ref]
