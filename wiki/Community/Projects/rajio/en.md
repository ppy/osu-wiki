**rajio.ppy.sh**, often referred to as **rajio**, was a request-based online radio service run and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) as a side project to osu! in 2008. It allowed people to queue up songs of their choice to be played in a global broadcast.

## Service

The way rajio functioned mirrors that of contemporary Discord music bots such as [Ayana](https://ayana.io/) and [FredBoat](https://fredboat.com/). Upon visiting the website, users could search for songs from peppy's personal music database to be added into the radio's queue — this database was estimated to be around ~400 GB in size, mostly comprising of J-pop/anime/video game songs.[^rajio-database-ref]

As rajio didn't support fetching songs from external sources such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), it was not possible to add songs that were not in the database into the queue. Due to technical limitations, the service was only able to handle 6 concurrent users at a time.

## Decommissioning and brief revival

rajio initially ran for a couple of years before being shut down in 2010.[^rajio-out-of-service-ref] A year later, due to increased community interest, ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) brought rajio back to life along with a new, dedicated `#rajio` channel in the [osu! chat](/wiki/Community/Internet_Relay_Chat).[^rajio-revival-ref1][^rajio-revival-ref2] This revival only lasted for a brief period before the service and the chat channel were gone for good.
