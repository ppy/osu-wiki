# Forum

*See also: [Internet forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum)*

[The osu! **forums**](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums) are a place for conversations where messages are grouped by subjects, and no quick response is expected. The discussions are searchable, stored forever, and may be revisited at any time, which makes them different from the near-instant messages in [osu! chat](/wiki/Community/Internet_Relay_Chat). As a result, forum messages are longer, contain more information, and typically provide more details than chat messages would.

The osu! forums provide features similar to most internet forums: [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode) markup, polls, pins and subscriptions, and [moderation](#moderation).

## Structure

Each of the osu! forums contains a variety of **topics**, sometimes called threads, as well as smaller categories, or **subforums**. Most of the forums are English only, but there also exists a number of [language-specific](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/23) forums for local communities that are large enough.

While some forums, such as [Mapping Discussion](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/56), have specific requirements or guidelines, all of them follow [the community rules](/wiki/Rules).

Each post on the forums may not contain more than 60000 characters.

## Roles and user groups

Some users may belong to one or several custom groups, based on their community tasks, access rights, or past activity. A full list of user groups can be found at [User group](/wiki/People/User_group).

In addition to user group badges provided by group membership, users may have [custom user titles](/wiki/Community/User_title) displayed under the avatar in each of their posts.

### Moderation

*See also: [Reporting bad behaviour ยง Forum](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour#forum)*

[Moderators](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) are users who keep the forums clean and appropriate, and answer concerns related to that. Moderators can edit or delete inappropriate posts or topics, pin topics and move them between different forums, and temporarily prevent offenders from posting by [silencing](/wiki/Silence) them.

## Special forums

Some of the forums have different purposes that are not limited to discussion. As a result, they have extra rules and/or technical capabilities.

- [Help](/wiki/Community/Forum/Help): technical support from the [Support Team](/wiki/People/Support_Team) and regular users.
- [Feature Requests](/wiki/Community/Forum/Feature_Requests): suggestions for osu! development.
- [Modding Queues](/wiki/Community/Forum/Modding_Queues): beatmap reviews done by other mappers and modders.
- [Off-Topic](/wiki/Community/Forum/Off-Topic): the place for the not-so-logical discussions.
- [Abandoned Wasteland](/wiki/Community/Forum/Abandoned_Wasteland): the storage for useless topics.

Additionally, there are other forums similar to Abandoned Wasteland, which serve technical or managerial purposes and are therefore hidden from the general public.

## History

[The first public forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/2) is dated August 28, 2007, and belongs to ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](/wiki/People/peppy). During that time, the osu! website used [phpBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB) as its forum engine, which over the years has been significantly expanded to suit the game and community's needs. Some of its customisations included:

- Integration with the [beatmap submission system](/wiki/Beatmapping/Beatmap_submission)
- The [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) and [beatmap ranking](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure) systems
- [Help](/wiki/Community/Forum/Help) and [Feature Requests](/wiki/Community/Forum/Feature_Requests) forums
- [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) and user pages

After the new osu! website was brought up and running, phpBB had been slowly phased out in favour of the custom forum engine used today.

Along with the introduction of the custom forum engine, the forum's private message system was phased out. The forum's private message system was separate from the private messages sent via IRC chat, which was not fully accessible from the osu! website at the time. Forum private messages (which were also known as *forum PMs*) could be far longer and could be formatted with BBCode, and could be sent to one or more recipients.
