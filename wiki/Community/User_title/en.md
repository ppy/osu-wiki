# User title

*For the list of people who have attained special user titles, see [Users with unique titles](/wiki/People/Users_with_unique_titles).*

A **user title** is a short label on a user's profile page set by the [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team). Most titles indicate membership of a [user group](/wiki/People/User_group), but some users have earned [more unique titles](/wiki/People/Users_with_unique_titles) for specific achievements or contributions.

The colour of a user title is the same as the user's colour, which is also usually set by group membership. If the user has no colour set, the title is white.

## History

### Post count titles

<!-- the bottom post on https://web.archive.org/web/20131107133826/https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/141240 -->

On the forum sections of the [old osu! website](https://old.ppy.sh)<!-- TODO: wiki page -->, users could obtain titles by reaching certain post count milestones as follows: <!-- https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/2306316 -->

| Forum title | Total post count |
| :-: | :-- |
| Rhythm Rookie | 0–4 |
| Tempo Trainee | 5–14 |
| Whistle Blower | 15–29 |
| Cymbal Sounder | 30–49 |
| Beat Clicker | 50–79 |
| Slider Savant | 80–119 |
| Spinner Sage | 120–179 |
| Star Shooter | 180–259 |
| Combo Commander | 260–499 |
| Rhythm Incarnate | 500+ |

These titles were only visible on the sidebars of forum posts (not on the users' profiles) and were not shown if another custom title was already set prior.

## Trivia

::: Infobox
![](img/multiple-titles.png "VINXIS' two titles being displayed at the same time")
:::

- User titles are referred to as "rank titles" throughout the game's code. This is a leftover name from when osu! was built on top of [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/).
- As of March 2021, users earning multiple titles are usually assigned a title that joins all of them together with slashes. Previously, it was more common to display only the most significant or most recent title.
