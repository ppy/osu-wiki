# osu! Talk Event

![osu! Talk Event banner](img/banner.png)

The **osu! Talk Event** is an event organised by [osu! University](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers/osu!_University) where different people hold talks about various topics, which are centred around a specific theme for each iteration.

Speakers hold their talks in a Stage channel on the [osu! Discord server](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers#official). During the event, thread channels are opened in the `#community-meetings` channel for discussion.

The talks are also livestreamed on [osu! University's Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/osuuniversity) and recordings of each talk are made available on [osu! University's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osuuniversity).

To participate as a speaker in one of these talks, or recommend someone who would be fit to give a talk, fill out the [speaker nomination form](https://forms.gle/HCD6ac8JwURGh8zx8).
