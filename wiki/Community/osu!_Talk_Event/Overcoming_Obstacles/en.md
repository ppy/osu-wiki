# osu! Talk Event: Overcoming Obstacles

![osu! Talk Event: Overcoming Obstacles banner](/wiki/shared/news/2022-05-19-osu-talk-event-overcoming-obstacles/ote-newspost-banner.png)

The **osu! Talk Event** is an event organised by [osu! University](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers/osu!_University) where different people held talks about various topics. This was the first iteration of the event with the theme of "overcoming obstacles".

Speakers held their talks in a Stage channel on the [osu! Discord server](/wiki/Community/Discord_servers#official). During the event, thread channels were opened in the `#community-meetings` channel for discussion.

The talks were also livestreamed on [osu! University's Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/osuuniversity) and recordings of each talk are available in [osu! University's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/osuuniversity).

To participate as a speaker in a future iteration of the event, or recommend someone who would be fit to give a talk, fill out the [speaker nomination form](https://forms.gle/HCD6ac8JwURGh8zx8).

## Event information

- **The event will last 3 days total**, from May 20 - 22, 2022.
- **The speaker will use a Discord stage channel** in the [osu! Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) to give their talk.
- **Talks will be less than 18 minutes long.** This is the maximum allowed length, not a goal to aim for â€” even a 3-minute talk can have massive impact.
- The stories shared do not necessarily have to be about osu!, but because this is an osu!-related event, speakers are recommended to try connecting their story or the lesson behind it to osu! in some way.
