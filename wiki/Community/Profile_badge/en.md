# Profile badge

*Not to be confused with group badges, which also appear on user profiles.*\
*For rules regarding usage as tournament prizing, see: [Official tournament support ยง Profile Badges](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#profile-badges)*

**Profile badges** (commonly referred to as just *badges*) are small graphics on user profile pages awarded for various achievements. They are most commonly given as [tournament](/wiki/Tournaments) and [contest](/wiki/Contests) prizes, but have other uses, such as rewards for [community contributors](/wiki/People/Community_Contributors), [Beatmap Spotlights](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights#rewards), and continued group membership.

When hovering over a badge, a tooltip is shown with more details about why the badge was awarded.

## Tournament seeding

*Main page: [Badge-weighted seeding](/wiki/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding)*

In the [game client](/wiki/Client) and on the website, badges are purely decorative. However, due to [tournament](/wiki/Tournaments) prize badges showcasing players' performance, some tournaments have adopted [seeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports)) methods that factor in the amount of badges players have, commonly known as [badge-weighted seeding](/wiki/Tournaments/Badge-weighted_seeding) (BWS).

## History

![Screenshot of Uan's badges on the old website](img/Uan.png "On the old website, profile badges stacked under the username and title.")

Rather than stacking horizontally in a container spanning the whole page, the old website stacked badges vertically between a user's username and country flag.

A side effect of this layout scheme was that the default, non-expanded height of [userpages](/wiki/osu!supporter#editable-profile-section) could be extended by means of earning more badges. While unintended, it became a running gag in the tournament community.<!-- More example userpages beyond Toy would be nice, else "running gag" doesn't have a source. -clayton --> ::{ flag=US }:: [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) showcased this in [a popular Tweet](https://twitter.com/droombs/status/1036050610687074304), showing off his record for most badges won at the time of posting.<!-- I couldn't find a definitive source for this but I'm fairly certain that was part of the joke. Toy was the first to reach 10 badges about a year before this, and he was tied with DigitalHypno at 20 a few months later. Please add a source as a reference if you can find one! -clayton -->

:::

- The first two profile badges were awarded to ::{ flag=PL }:: [niedzwiedz1124](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9610) and ::{ flag=PL }:: [White Wolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) on 6 September, 2009, for [winning *Tag Tournament*](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/17169).<!-- TODO: The changelog entry for badges being added is also on the same day, and should be mentioned. are these available online anywhere to link to? -clayton -->
- Badges can link to other web pages for more context, like a tournament's forum page or a wiki entry.
- Badges prevent others from being able to [take the player's current or past usernames](/wiki/Help_centre/Account#take-existing-username).
