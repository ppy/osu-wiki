## History

Until 2023, large-scale osu!-related events were rarely held in Russia. Usually, these were small community meetups of 10–20 people, but many were interested in more significant events.

Inspired by [cavoe's osu! event](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event), the #russian osu cup tournament teams and the [play-osu.ru](https://play-osu.ru) community decided in 2023 to organize their own event in Moscow, primarily dedicated to the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_modes/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_modes). In subsequent iterations, other modes joined as well. After many jokes about a "bench event," the CIS community finally saw the Moscow osu! Event!

The event received support from various sponsors who provided prizes, equipment, and souvenirs for participants and guests. For example, the tablet manufacturer [Parblo](https://www.parblo.com/) gave attendees the opportunity to try their products in a drawing contest, and the [play-osu.ru](https://play-osu.ru) booth offered various board games and mini-tournaments for mobile rhythm games such as [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/en) and [Project SEKAI: Colorful Stage](https://www.colorfulstage.com/).

In 2023, the event was attended by more than 250 people, and in 2024 already 450. Participants from the [osu! community](/wiki/Community) from all over Russia and neighboring countries come to MOE.
