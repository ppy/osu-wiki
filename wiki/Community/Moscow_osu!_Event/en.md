## History

Until 2023, large-scale osu!-related events were rarely held in Russia. Usually, these were small community meetups of 10–20 people, but many were interested in larger events.

Inspired by [cavoe's osu! event](wiki/cavoe's_osu!_event), the #russian osu cup tournament teams and the [play-osu.ru](https://play-osu.ru) community decided in 2023 to organize their own event in Moscow, primarily dedicated to the [osu!standard](wiki/Game_modes/osu!) [game mode](wiki/Game_modes). In subsequent iterations, other modes joined as well. After many jokes about a "bench event", the CIS community finally saw the Moscow osu! Event!

MOE is a venue with information booths, a computer area for playing [osu!](wiki/Client) and showcasing results, a stage for presentations and the main tournament, as well as a separate lounge area for tournament participants and special ticket holders.

In 2023, the event was attended by over 250 people, and in 2024 — already 450. MOE attracts members of the [osu! community](wiki/Community) from all over Russia and neighboring countries.
