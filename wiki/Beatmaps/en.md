# Beatmaps

<!-- TODO:
- figure out what the right relationship is between this and the Beatmapsets article, it doesn't make a lot of sense right now because most of this info can be about beatmapsets too
- maybe the ranked statuses / beatmap categories should be its own article?
- relationship to beatmap packs, osu!direct, charts, leaderboards, contests, ...
-->

*Not to be confused with [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties).*

**Beatmaps** are game levels created for songs. They contain [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects), [timing](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing)<!-- TODO: this should not be referencing the editor --> information, difficulty settings, and visual effects<!-- TODO: more links here -->.

Beatmaps are made as part of **[beatmapsets](Beatmapsets)**. Beatmapsets group beatmaps together so that they can be [submitted](/wiki/Glossary#bss) to the website and show up on the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets). They typically cover one song, where each beatmap of the set is a different [difficulty](/wiki/Difficulties).

## Beatmap categories

Beatmaps submitted online are split into categories depending on their recent activity, nomination<!-- TODO: link --> status, and popularity:

- [Graveyard](#graveyard)
- [Work in Progress / Pending](#work-in-progress-and-pending)
- [Qualified](#qualified)
- [Ranked](#ranked)
- [Loved](#loved)

### Graveyard

Graveyarded beatmaps are beatmaps that have been abandoned by their creator. Beatmaps are moved to the Graveyard category from the [Work in Progress and Pending](#work-in-progress-and-pending) categories automatically once they haven't been updated for 4 weeks. Graveyarded beatmaps do not have leaderboards and will not affect user statistics. However, they can still be downloaded and played like normal. They use the question mark icon (![](/wiki/shared/status/graveyard.png)) in the song selection screen<!-- TODO: link -->.

Once a beatmap is graveyarded, it can be revived (i.e. brought back to [Pending](#work-in-progress-and-pending)). This can be done by updating the beatmap via the [beatmap submission system](/wiki/Glossary#bss).

### Work in Progress and Pending

Work in Progress (commonly initialised as *WIP*) and Pending are the two categories beatmaps are put into on initial submission. Beatmaps in these categories can move to the [Qualified](#qualified) category upon [nomination](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#nominations) by at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators). This usually includes a great amount of feedback from [modders](/wiki/Glossary#modder) through [modding](/wiki/Modding). Work in Progress and Pending beatmaps do not have leaderboards and will not affect user statistics. They use the question mark icon (![](/wiki/shared/status/pending.png)) in the song selection screen.

Inactive beatmaps that have been in this category for 4 weeks are automatically moved into the [Graveyard](#graveyard) category.

### Qualified

Qualified is last stage of the [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). These beatmaps have been nominated by at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) who have made sure that the beatmap meets the standards of the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria). Beatmaps put into Qualified enter a [ranking queue](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#moving-to-ranked), and will eventually be [Ranked](#ranked) if they aren't [disqualified](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure#nomination-resets) from the queue. This period serves as a last line of defense in which any flaws and mistakes that might have slipped through can be fixed.

Qualified beatmaps have leaderboards, but no [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded and all scores will be deleted when it moves out of Qualified. They use the check icon (![](/wiki/shared/status/qualified.png)) in the song selection screen.

### Ranked

<!-- TODO: mention approved -->

Ranked beatmaps are endorsed as official content, in the sense that they have reached or surpassed the standards of the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria). They allow players to compete on leaderboards and gain [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points) from setting scores. Once a beatmap has achieved Ranked status, its status cannot be altered again (except in extraordinary cases). Ranked beatmaps use the double upwards chevron icon (![](/wiki/shared/status/ranked.png)) in the song selection screen.

### Loved

*For history of the Loved category, see: [History of Loved](/wiki/Beatmaps/History_of_Loved)*

Loved beatmaps may not meet the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), but are *loved* by the community and thus are regularly added based on community votes in [Project Loved](/wiki/Project_Loved). They have leaderboards, but no [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded and all scores will be deleted if it moves out of Loved (this usually only happens on the creator's request). Loved beatmaps use the heart icon (![](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png)) in the song selection screen.
