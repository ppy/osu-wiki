# Beatmaps

*Not to be confused with: [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties).*

Beatmaps are game levels in [osu!](/wiki/osu!_glossary), like the stages in the [DS games](/wiki/Glossary/#ds-games). In their most basic form, a beatmap have a song and various [hit objects](/wiki/hit_objects) placed according to the rhythm of the music. They can also have a background image, video, and/or [storyboard](/wiki/storyboard).

Beatmaps can be uploaded by the [BSS](/wiki/BSS) (Beatmap Submission System) and are then run through an approval process called [modding](/wiki/modding) in order to maintain the high standards of playability.

You can find beatmaps in the [Beatmaps Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) page on osu! web.

## Ranked Statuses

Both ranked and approved beatmaps requires approval from two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). They can influence the stats on a player's profile which is what makes them different from a [pending](#pending) or [graveyarded](#graveyard) beatmap.

### Ranked

Ranked beatmaps use the double upwards chevron icon (![Double upwards chevron icon](/wiki/shared/status/ranked.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps ideally fulfill all of the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria). This is to ensure that most players can expect a certain kind of standard while playing them.

### Approved

Approved beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/status/approved.png)) in the song select screen.

The approved status is typically for songs that are over five minutes in length (also known as a [marathon](/wiki/marathon)), measured with the total [drain time](/wiki/drain_time) of a beatmap. Most approved beatmaps do not have an [easy](/wiki/easy) or [normal](/wiki/normal) difficulty. However, some creators may uploaded them as separate beatmapsets with identical songs while some are included inside a ranked song, containing ranked beatmaps.

### Qualified

Qualified beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/status/qualified.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps are in the last stage of the beatmapping and modding process. Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialogue will display, noting the status of the beatmap will cause:

- No [pp](/wiki/pp) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the status is changed.
  - If the status is changed to ranked, approved, or back to pending; all scores will be wiped!

When a beatmap is qualified, it has passed the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria) and has been checked by two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). Qualified beatmaps is the last line of defense as they are required to be in this status for one week before becoming [ranked](#ranked) or [approved](#approved) permanently.

During the one week duration, however, [QATs](/wiki/QAT) are allowed to write up issues with these beatmaps. If this happens, the beatmapset's status will go back to pending and the process starts over again.

### Loved

Loved beatmaps use the heart icon (![Heart icon](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps may not meet the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria) but are _loved_ by the community and thus are regularly added based on community votes. Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialoge will display, noting the status of the beatmap will cause:

- No [pp](/wiki/pp) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the creator updates the beatmap.

This status will give those beatmaps a leaderboard.

To get a beatmap in the loved status, see the forum post: [Get your beatmap Loved!](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/549835).

### Pending

*Main page: [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure)*

Pending beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/pending.png)) in the song select screen.

A beatmap with a pending status is usually waiting to be [modded](/wiki/modded). [Creators](/wiki/Creators) must seek for [modders](/wiki/modders) from the community and at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) to get their beatmapset out of this status.

Inactive beatmaps that have been in this category for 4 weeks are automatically moved into the [graveyard](#graveyard) status.

All pending beatmaps do not affect user statistics.

### Graveyard

Graveyarded beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/graveyard.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps were initally [pending](#pending), but are moved to this status because they have not been updated or its thread post was inactive for 4 weeks. These beatmaps cannot be updated until the [mapper](/wiki/mapper) revives it by clicking the `Revive Beatmap` link in their profile, under the category `Beatmaps`.

All graveyarded beatmaps do not affect user statistics.

For the sake of saving digital space for newer beatmaps, osu! will purge graveyarded beatmaps if they have been in this status for a long period of time.
