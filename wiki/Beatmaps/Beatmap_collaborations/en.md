# Beatmap collaborations

*For help starting a collaboration, see: [How to start a beatmap collaboration](/wiki/Guides/Collab_Information)*

**Beatmap collaborations**, or ***collabs***, are [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) created by multiple people. "Collab" can refer to either a single difficulty or [beatmapsets](/wiki/Glossary#beatmapset) with [guest difficulties](/wiki/Glossary#guest-difficulty).

Collab difficulties are usually marked by "Collab" or possession of multiple usernames in the difficulty name.
