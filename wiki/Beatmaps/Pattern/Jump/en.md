# Jump

A **jump** is an [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [pattern](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern) where two [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) are spaced far apart on the playfield compared to the spacing between other objects. Jumps usually signal high intensity in a song and they are most commonly snapped to 1/2 ticks on the [timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines#hit-objects).

Jumps are usually played with snappy movement, as opposed to the smooth movement of [streams](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern/Stream).
