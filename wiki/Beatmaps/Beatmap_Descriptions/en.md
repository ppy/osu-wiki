## About Beatmap Descriptions

Beatmap descriptions are small areas under a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps)'s page that give players information about said beatmap using [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode). Most [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked) beatmaps use at least one image, a number (depending on how many beatmaps the creator has Ranked), and a difficulty section.


## Good Beatmap Descriptions

*Notice: In order to get a beatmap ranked, it is recommended you have a good beatmap description, but this is not required.

A good beatmap description would include:
- A list of all the guest difficulties and their creators
- An "18+ lyrics" warning (if neccessary)
- Information that would help a player decide whether they want to download the beatmap or not
- An edits list or changelog 

### Images

Many beatmap descriptions contain at least one image. To learn know how to add a image using BBCode, check out the [BBCode article](/wiki/BBCode#image).
Also, make sure you have the link of the image you want to put in the beatmap description.

### Difficulty Sections

A difficulty section is located in a beatmap description, usually this section has a list of all the guest difficulties and their creators, this is mostly used to showcase the difficulties of a beatmap.
Difficulty sections usually have images for the icons.

#### Difficulty Icons
