# Genre and language

![A screenshot of genre, language, and tags on a beatmap page](img/beatmap-info.png "Genre and language are listed on beatmap pages.")

[Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) submitted to the website have **genre** and **language** fields to help categorise songs. They default to `Unspecified` and `Other` respectively, and can be edited by [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) and [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) members. Mapset owners are also able to set the genre and language of their beatmaps as long as the beatmap is in the WIP<!-- TODO: link -->, [Pending](/wiki/Beatmaps#pending), or [Graveyard](/wiki/Beatmaps#graveyard) categories.

Genre and language have no function in the game, but will be available as search options in osu!lazer<!-- TODO: link me -->.
