# Technical maps

<!-- Line to be added eventually: *Not to be confused with [Slider Art](link) or [Taikosu maps](link) -->

*Notice: For the purposes of this article, the term "tech map" will be treated as an umbrella term that includes all of these definitions. Though please keep in-mind that no clear, "official" verdict has been made and the wiki intends to reflect that.*

**Technical maps** (often shortened to "tech map") is a term that does not have a clear, agreed-upon definition amongst the osu! community. Depending on the user, "tech map" can be as broad as a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) that simply contains non-generic beatmap [patterns](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern), or as specific as a beatmap that is dense in [object](/wiki/Hit_object) count and contains many irregular [slider](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider) shapes that quickly and drastically change speeds (often at high intensity).

Tech maps are most often associated with song genres that offer complex and fast-paced sounds (e.g., drum-and-bass, dubstep, and drumstep) as they often allow for the mapper to explore each and every individual sound in-detail to the beatmap's advantage. Although music of this type is not explicitly required.

Regardless of definition, many players claim that tech maps are unfair (in terms of skill) due to the main increase in difficulty deriving mostly or solely from the confusing patterns or irregular sliders. Likewise, this means that they are not very popular for gaining large amounts of [pp](/wiki/Performance_Points) at once due to the way the current system works and how it undervalues beatmaps of this nature.

## Definitions

Due to the broad nature of the term "tech map," there are many different aspects that could describe the term. The lists below describe different definitions from popular "types" of players. 

### Broadest definition

*Notice: the "broadest" definition only requires one or two of the aspects listed to be present in order to define a beatmap as tech.*

- Non-generic or difficult-to-read beatmap patterns (example shown below)
  - A hard "flow" to the beatmap
- SV sliders
  - These may contain slider art
- Irregular slider shapes
- Quick and sharp changes in slider speed
- Overall high intensity
  - Extremely dense in object count throughout large parts of the map (excluding [streams](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern/Stream))

### Most restrictive/most specific definition

*Notice: the "most restrictive/specific" definition requires **all** all of the aspects listed to be present in order to define a beatmap as tech.*

- Irregular slider shapes
- Quick and sharp changes in slider speed
- SV sliders
- Difficult-to-read beatmap patterns (often described as having a hard "flow") (example shown below)

Good examples of tech maps that fit this definition are [Camelia - Exit This Earth's Atomosphere (Camellia's "PLANETARY//200STEP" Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/855677#osu/1787848) and [LeaF - MARENOL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1136149#osu/2404722).

### Mapper's definition

*Notice: the "mapper's definition" is a list conjured up from the perspective of a typical osu!standard mapper.*

<!--PLACEHOLDER--> <!--I'm not a mapper, so I'll be leaving this list to be written by a respected mapper-->

<!--Other definitions like a "Player's definition" or something like that *could* be written, but I think this is enough for now-->

<!--Some other sections that would be cool to add:
- A "History" section would be pretty cool. But idk how feasible this would be. -->
