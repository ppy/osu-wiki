# Offset (disambiguation)

**Offset** can have multiple meanings:

## Timing settings

- An [uninherited timing point](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timing#uninherited-timing-point) ("red line"), the start of a new [timing section](/wiki/Beatmapping/Timing_section). Timing points reside at an offset relative to the start of the audio file, but the timing point itself is also sometimes called "offset".
- A beatmap "offset", the amount of time between the start of the audio file and the song's first [downbeat](/wiki/Music_theory/Downbeat) measured in milliseconds.
- [Online offset](/wiki/Beatmap/Online_offset), a timing change applied by [NAT](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) to ranked beatmaps with incorrect beatmap offset in order to adjust it.
- [Local ("offline") offset](/wiki/Glossary/Local_song_offset), a per-beatmap setting that shifts the objects in time during gameplay.
- [Universal offset](/wiki/Client/Options/Universal_offset), the osu! client setting that globally affects the timing of beatmaps.

## Beatmap settings

- Countdown offset, a setting which affects the appearance of [countdown](/wiki/Beatmapping/Countdown) before the first hit object.
- Audio offset, or [audio lead-in](/wiki/Beatmap/Lead-in).
- Video offset, a setting that shows how soon a background video should play relatively to the audio track.
