# Disambiguation

Disambiguation in the osu! wiki is the process of resolving conflicts that arise when a potential article title is ambiguous, most often because it refers to more than one subject covered by the osu! wiki, either as the main topic of an article, or as a subtopic covered by an article in addition to the article's main topic.
