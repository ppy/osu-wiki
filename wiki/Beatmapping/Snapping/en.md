# Snapping

**Snapping** refers to a [hit object](/wiki/Hit_objects)'s position on the [hit objects timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines#hit-objects) in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). Changing the [beat snap divisor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Beat_Snap_Divisor) allows hit objects to "snap" to different ticks when moved in the timeline.
