# Time signature

*For more information on time signatures in music theory, see: [Time signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature)*

A **time signature** is a musical term that indicates the number of [beats](/wiki/Beat) in a single measure (indicated by the top number), and which note indicates a single beat (indicated by the bottom number).

osu! offers two alternative time signatures for [mapping](/wiki/Beatmapping), which can be selected from the `Timing` menu in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). These include 4/4 (a.k.a. "common time" signature), and 3/4 (a.k.a. the "Waltz" or "three-four-time" signature). osu! will not prevent users from mapping songs that are written in different signatures, although it is not guaranteed that the beatmap will align with the song if this is done.
