# Health drain

**[Health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health) drain** refers to the natural drain of the [health bar](/wiki/Glossary/Health_bar) that occurs when playing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). Health drain is dependent on the [HP drain rate](/wiki/Beatmapping/HP_drain_rate) difficulty setting.

Health drain is only active in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch). It also does not take effect before the start of gameplay or during breaks.
