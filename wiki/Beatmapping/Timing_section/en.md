# Timing section

*For tips on timing beatmaps, see: [How to time songs](/wiki/Guides/How_to_Time_Songs)*

A **timing section** in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor) denotes a change in the timing (e.g. [offset](/wiki/Offset) or [BPM](/wiki/Music_theory/Tempo)) of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). Beatmaps can have a single timing section that takes up the whole song or many timing sections that are split up throughout the song.

When the tempo of a song changes, creators are required to add a new timing section to accompany the new tempo. A beatmap that uses incorrect timing will not be considered rankable.
