# Overmapping

**Overmapping** is a term used when [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object/) or arrangement of hit objects are done in a way that makes the [difficulty](/wiki/Difficulties/) of the map contrast the song.

This is usually done by adding unnecessarily large [jumps](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern/Jump/), [slider velocity](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider_velocity/) changes, or by mapping to inaudible or non-existant sounds. (i.e. adding notes on blue ticks when the song uses red ticks)
