# Star rating

**Star rating** (***SR***) describes a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap)'s difficulty, which is automatically calculated by the osu! client. Star rating plays a large role in how [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points) are awarded. This number can be seen on the [song selection screen](/wiki/Interface#song-selection-screen) and on a beatmap's info page.

![Star rating ranges](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty/img/SR-range.png)

On the website, beatmaps are automatically given a difficulty icon based on these star rating ranges:

- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/easy-s.png) Easy: 0.0★–1.99★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/normal-s.png) Normal: 2.0★–2.69★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/hard-s.png) Hard: 2.7★–3.99★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/insane-s.png) Insane: 4.0★–5.29★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/expert-s.png) Expert: 5.3★–6.49★
- ![](/wiki/shared/diff/expertplus-s.png) Expert+: 6.5★ and above

Most maps' intended difficulty levels match the icons they are given, but some deviate significantly. This is why the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) defines more precise rules for determining difficulty and evaluating beatmapset spreads.
