# Silences

**Silence** is the term used to describe the punishment of limiting a user's means of communications within the osu! community. Members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) and [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) typically issue these silences to maintain a clean environment, both on the website and in-game.

## Limitations

A user who has an active silence cannot do the following:

- Use the online [chat](/wiki/Client/Interface/Chat_console) (public and private), both in-game and on the website.
- Post on any of the osu! forums.
- Post comments anywhere on the website (beatmaps, changelog, news).
- Take part in [beatmap discussions](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion).
- Edit profile details, change the avatar, cover and userpage.
- Submit and update beatmaps.
- Partake in [multiplayer](/wiki/Client/Interface/Multiplayer) games.

Once a silence is issued to a user, all of their messages in chat are removed and an alert will be displayed in the place of the chat input field containing the duration of the active silence.[^chat-cleanup]

## Durations

The duration of a silence starts at 5 minutes and generally doubles for each subsequent offence, up to a maximum of 28 days, but the initial duration may vary depending on the offence committed and the user's prior history. The factors considered when determining the length of a silence include:

- **Atmosphere:** The current chat environment's state.
- **Frequency:** Repetitiveness regardless of previous silences given.
- **History:** Records of previous infringements.
- **Severity:** The seriousness of the offence committed.

In some cases, users may receive a final warning before an [account restriction](/wiki/Help_centre/Account_restrictions) is placed, providing an opportunity to cease the offending behaviour.

## Common reasons for silences

Some common reasons why users get silenced in public chat include, but are not limited to:

- **Spamming or flooding:** Self-explanatory.
- **Caps abuse:** Chatting with all uppercase letters.
- **Inappropriate behaviour/conversation:** The public chat is not a place for discussions not appropriate for all ages, or for inflammatory topics.
- **Racism:** Discrimination or hatred based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
- **Advertising:** Promoting products or services. This includes Discord invite links and streaming links such as Twitch and YouTube.
- **Unwanted content:** Websites containing piracy, screamers, referrals and the like.

Silences may also be given to users for other reasons, such as (but not limited to):

- **Inappropriate beatmap submission:** Details such as metadata, tags, difficulty names, and background images.
- **Inappropriate conduct:** Places such as the forums, beatmap discussions and comments.
- **Inappropriate profile:** Content such as avatars, covers and profile details.

## Appealing

While silences are implemented to maintain a positive community environment, errors can occur. If you believe that the silence issued to you was an error or unjustified, kindly contact the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team#accounts@ppy.sh) at [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) and explain the situation.

Keep in mind that you must use the email address associated with your osu! account and mention your username to confirm it's you.
