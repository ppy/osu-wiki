# Website

*Main page: [Help centre](/wiki/Help_centre)*

This section is dedicated to issues with the osu! website.

## Common issues {id=common-issues}

### I have not received a reply to my support ticket and it's been over 2 weeks! {id=support-no-reply}

**The vast majority of the time, this is due to a high number of tickets coming into our system at once.**

You can always send a single reply to your currently open ticket asking about the state of your case, but make sure not to do this more than once or twice a week. You can also contact us on Twitter at [@osusupport](https://twitter.com/osusupport) to ask about your ticket.

In rare circumstances, support tickets from chronically offending users may be deliberately ignored, though the [support team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Account_support_team) will **always** tell you when they will no longer be responding to you first. If you have not received a notification like this, you do not need to worry about it!

### Can I completely block another user from contacting me? {id=ignore-user}

**Yes, absolutely.**

In the event that another user is harassing you via private messages either on the forums or via the game client itself, there are a few steps that you can take yourself to filter out their messages.

#### Blocking a user from contacting you in-game {id=ignore-user-in-game}

**To block a user from sending you messages in-game, simply add them to your ignore list.**

1. Click the `Options` menu button in-game
2. Type `ignore` to filter the options listing to the `Chat Ignore List` section.
3. Add the offending user's username to the list, separating each new user with a space, and replacing any spaces in their name with underscores (A user called *The Gatekeeper* becomes *The\_Gatekeeper* for example).

You'll no longer see public chat messages from any users on that list, or receive private messages from them.

If you wish to ignore highlights, private messages, or public messages, you can simply append respectively `@h`, `@p`, `@c` to their username. `The_Gatekeeper@c` will ignore the user's messages in public channels. It is possible to combine those: `The_Gatekeeper@ph` will ignore highlights and private messages, but leave public messages visible.

#### Blocking all non-friends from sending private messages in-game {id=ignore-strangers-in-game}

If you wish to prevent anyone not on your friends list from sending you private messages, follow the following steps. **Please note: moderators are not affected by this functionality and can always PM you. If you feel a moderator is harassing you in spite of this, you should contact [our support team](mailto:support@ppy.sh).**

1. Click the `Options` button on the main menu, or press `Ctrl` + `O`.
2. Type `block` to filter the options listing to the `In-game Chat` section.
3. Click on the setting that appears to enable it.

Users who are not on your friends list can no longer contact you.

<!-- TODO: describe how to ignore others' posts and comments when https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues/2319 is implemented -->

#### Prevent any new forum private messages from reaching you {id=ignore-strangers-website}

Go to your [account settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit) and click `block private messages from people not on your friends list` in the Privacy section. Private messages from users in your friends list will still reach you.

### What if I'm still having problems with a user after blocking them? {id=ignore-did-not-help}

**Never fear, our support staff will help you out.**

If a user is still harassing you via other means, or using their friends or someone else to circumvent your effort to block them, please send us an email at [support@ppy.sh](mailto:support@ppy.sh).

Make sure to include any chat logs or other evidence in the email, and our support staff will look into your case and get it sorted for you.

### What are these "Me!" pages that I see on other player's profiles? {id=userpage}

**Me! pages, or userpages, are special profile elements that all players with a [supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) get access to. They can contain whatever you like — pictures of your achievements, your beatmaps, basically anything you wish!**

Players with a [supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) are given the privilege of editing their very own page for display on their profile for the world to see. Me! pages may contain anything you like, so long as it follows the [community rules](/wiki/Rules)!

Even if your [supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) happens to run out, your Me! page will **remain visible** and you will still be able to edit its contents.

### My Me! page contents are missing! {id=userpage-removed}

**This can happen if your Me! page had inappropriate content on it as defined by our [community rules](/wiki/Rules).**

In such cases, you may open up a ticket with the support team by emailing [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) and discussing your situation with them.

If at any point you are in doubt as to whether something is appropriate for a Me! page, you may message any of the members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Global_Moderation_Team) with what you plan to put up and they'll let you know if it's okay.

### Do I need to use my email address to register? {id=email-purpose}

**Yes. We require your email address to send you password reset requests and verification codes when needed.**

If you have trouble connecting via the game client, please check your firewall and anti-virus settings to make sure osu! isn't being blocked.

If you ever lose your password or cannot access your account, your registration email is our first point of contact with you.

### Why are the statistics in my user profile page wrong? {id=wrong-statistics}

**You might be looking at your stats for another game mode!**

If you have been inactive for a lengthy period of time and your statistics are shown wrong, simply play a few maps to display them again. Inactive users have their scores hidden to keep the rankings fresh.
