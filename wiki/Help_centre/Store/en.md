# osu!store and merchandise

*Main page: [Help centre](/wiki/Help_centre)*\
*For older product troubleshooting, see: [Store archive](/wiki/Help_centre/Store/Store_archive)*

This article only applies to products purchased from the [osu!store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/listing).

## I need to change my address! {id=address}

Send an email to [merch@ppy.sh](mailto:merch@ppy.sh) with your order number and the correct address.

If your order hasn't shipped yet, we'll update the address and send it to the right place. If it has shipped already, there's unfortunately not much we can do.

## My product still hasn't arrived! {id=status}

When purchasing a product from the osu!store, you'll receive an email with a tracking number as soon as the product is shipped.

If your order has arrived in your country, but hasn't been delivered yet, it may be held at your local post office. Contact them and mention your tracking number for additional info! This is sometimes required for international purchases where customs or other taxes/duties are involved.

Sometimes orders can get stuck in the postal system. If your order is stuck somewhere in the United States, it may be possible to track down through the [USPS](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/USPS-Tracking-The-Basics), usually by contacting the relevant location on your tracking info. If your order is stuck outside of the United States, contact your country's postal service for help.

Feel free to contact [merch@ppy.sh](mailto:merch@ppy.sh) if you're still confused, but note that after a product leaves our hands, we know as much about the status of the delivery as you do.

## I need help with a specific product!

### osu!tablet {id=osu!tablet}

While most osu! products are shipped from our warehouse in the United States, [osu!tablets (intro)](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/1447) are shipped from Hong Kong using Hongkong Post e-Express+. Due to trade restrictions between Hong Kong and the United States, we're unable to ship these tablets to the United States.

## None of this applies to what I need help with! {id=none}

Contact [merch@ppy.sh](mailto:merch@ppy.sh) and we'll try to figure it out.
